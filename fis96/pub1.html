<p>A shift in opinion is taking
place, in information science and other disciplines, in which the
concept of information plays a central role. The need for this
arises from the transformation processes to which our society is
subject, and which are being pushed forward by the breakneck pace
of developments in information and communication technologies.
These processes tend to proceed spontaneously, without our full
awareness, and are not accompanied by an equally rapid growth in
scientific insight, let alone foresight. There is no science of
the information society. </p>

<p>This change of view appeared
five years ago in the efforts of some researchers to establish an
exchange of ideas, brought about by the realisation that their
considerations were breaking out of the boundaries of their
respective fields. These pioneers included Mike Conrad of the
Wayne State University, Koichiro Matsuno of the Nagaoka
University of Technology, and Pedro Marijuán of the University
of Zaragoza, all of whom were working at the interface of biology
and computer sciences. Their efforts resulted in the organisation
of a first international conference on the Foundations of
Information Science in 1994 in Madrid. The circle of scientists
who felt drawn by the subject grew ever larger; semiotics, system
theory and general evolution theory were represented (in the form
of some of their scientific organisations) in the preparations
for FIS 96, the Second Conference on the Foundations of
Information Science. This was hosted by the Social Cybernetics
Group at the Institute of Design and Technology Assessment of the
Vienna University of Technology. </p>

<p>The search was on for a unified
theory of information. For me it is only natural that it was in
Vienna, where unified science began, and the concept of evolution
is just as alive as ever, that the following aims were presented:
incorporating the reformulation of information theory into the
radical changes which affect the natural and social sciences,
cross-sectional and formal sciences, and philosophy; and finding
a background theory for an as yet unformulated general theory of
information within an evolutionary system theory, which itself is
still to be created. It has become clear, however, that such
complicated questions cannot be resolved by a simple show of
hands at a single conference. In particular, the rift between
those disciplines which count as precise, and those which are
seen as less precise, remains to be solved. </p>

<p>The articles in this issue of
INFORMATIK FORUM are presented against this background. It
concerns the ability to listen to others, and accept their claim
that the subject is relevant to other disciplines as well. The
articles were chosen from fields which together represent a
cross-section of modern science: physics, biology, psychology,
sociology, technology, philosophy. Only by using
transdisciplinary vision can we master the challenges presented
by today¹s scientific and social developments. </p>

<p>I would like to take this
opportunity to thank the Forschungsgesellschaft für Informatik,
which not only supported the organisation of FIS 96, but also
made possible the articles presented here. </p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Boltzmann, Einstein and Everett
provided relative-state formulations. Einstein always considered
Boltzmann as his master. Boltzmann's idea is very simple: Two
copies of the universe which differ only in the direction of time
are one and the same universe. Leibniz and Boscovich could
already have said the same thing, although they apparently did
not do so. </p>

<p>Boltzmann's finding has an
important corollary. A time reversal in a subsystem of the
universe is equivalent to a time reversal in the rest of the
universe. In particular, a time reversal in the observer is
equivalent to a time reversal in the external world. </p>

<p>At first sight, this is an
innocuous statement since a &quot;time reversal in the
observer&quot; seems as unlikely an event to expect as a time
reversal in the whole universe. Note that the latter requires
that all particles in the universe reverse their directions of
motion simultaneously. This could only occur spontaneously if all
particles collided simultaneously in such a way that all
momentums become zero at the same moment - a virtually infinitely
unlikely event. The same argument at first sight applies to an
observing subsystem. </p>

<p>Only if the observer is very
simple - a single oscillator -is it trivially correct that
relative to it, the world undergoes a time reversal after every
half period. </p>

<p>In the following, it will be
shown that the &quot;single-pendulum observer&quot; actually is a
prototype for a much larger class of observers - including
possibly ourselves. Boltzmann's microscopic relativity would then
force a radically new view of reality upon us. </p>

<p><h5>Abstract</h5></p>

<p>In this communication, the Law
of Transformational Morphogenesis is introduced. This law which
has been used implicitly in computer simulation of natural forms,
provides the required framework to reduce to Genetics the
transformational geometry mechanisms identified by D'Arcy
Thompson as a key concept to characterize growth processes.
Combined with two companion hypotheses of considerable
explicative power (that codes for form and substance are largely
independent in the genes and that introns code for
morphogenesis), the transformational morphogenesis approach
allows the reduction of Morphology, Embryology and Morphological
Phylogeny to Molecular Genetics where Homology, ageing, natural
death and some other developmental phenomena and abnormalities
arise as natural consequences of the mechanisms identified by the
present theory. </p>

<h4><a name="experiment">An Experiment with Pragmatic Information</a></h4>

<p>Walter von Lucadou</p>

<h5>Abstract</h5>

<p>The model of pragmatic
information (MPI), which is a candidate for a non-classical model
of psychology, predicts that the behavior of a non-classical
system depends on the conditions of its observation. The
exchanged pragmatic information (meaningful information) ties the
&quot;observer&quot; (e.g. a person) and the &quot;observed&quot;
(e.g. a machine) together and creates an &quot;organizational
closed system&quot;. It is assumed that this process produces
non-local correlations between the observer and the observed. </p>

<p>As a target to demonstrate this
&quot;observer effect&quot;, a quantum physical random event
generator (REG) was used which was observed by human subjects who
had the instruction to &quot;influence mentally&quot; the outcome
of the observed REG. </p>

<p>The &quot;observers&quot; are
characterized by a set of psychological variables which were
measured by questionnaires before the observation-experiment. The
&quot;observed&quot; is characterized by a set of statistical
variables describing the observed random process. An
&quot;observer effect&quot; should show up in correlations
between these two sets of variables. </p>

<p>The results support the
assumptions of the MPI that a human observer (or other
self-organizing systems?) may select certain noise fluctuations
from a seemingly separated system via non-local correlations if a
feedback-loop generates &quot;meaning&quot; of the process to the
observer. The process can be adequately described by the concept
of &quot;pragmatic information&quot;. It is shown that the
concept of &quot;pragmatic information&quot; is a much better
descriptor of the observation process than any other
&quot;Shannon-type&quot; measure of information. The correlations
between psychological and physical variables reflect the
pragmatic information of the display and the instruction given to
the subjects. </p>

<h4><a name="plenty">There is Plenty of Information Available but - What For?</a></h4>

<p>Elohim Jiménez-López</p>

<h5>Abstract</h5>

<p>In our times most of us seem to
be certain that it is impossible to avoid the appearance of
something else in the future. Such kind of belief leads to assume
that things in the earthly space cannot remain exactly the same
while our Planet continues turning around itself and around our
Sun. Then it seems evident that new things will emerge
unavoidably here and there while some other things that had
existed previously have not other chance than to disappear
inexorably. On the other hand some of us have been learning in
addition that events in the future will raise consequently from
previous circumstances, necessarily conditioned and altered by
actions happening at present, which could have been conceived
purposefully aiming to get something else in the future. </p>

<p>However it is convenient to
notice that the future for human individuals and communities may
arise from circumstances significantly moulded during their
respective existences by means of actions conceived by only a
couple of individuals performing intentionally active. Gradually
actions of this kind have made possible the emergence of a
man-made World superimposed on the natural one. This World is now
essentially the human habitat built and rebuilt by means of an
increasing number of technological 'facilities' provided by
peculiar circumstances created by the Western civilization, the
prevailing one since several centuries ago. Today it is quite
evident that the future of many of us in particular and the
future of our World is largely determined by &#147;the
technological imperative which, like natural selection and
evolution, inevitably leads where it will and precludes
purposeful change, directed progress.³ [1]. </p>

<p>Then, according to the trends of
this civilization, in very recent years it is increasingly
claimed or simply alleged that humankind is at the dawn of the
information age. An age created by technological facilities which
will make available the information about everything to anybody
willing to comprehend and solve all kinds of problems confronted
by men everywhere. Such perspective has made necessary to find
out ways to deal scientifically with this kind of intellectual
resources. Consequently it has been considered viable to
constitute what might be the Information Science. </p>

<p>So far so good, but I dare to
wonder why most scientists, practitioners, experts or educators
are not more extensively and deeply involved in learning faster
how to use effectively the huge amount of information already
available for trying to comprehend and solve gradually,
consistently and congruously the growing number of critical and
very complex problems that many more humans have been facing
inevitably along this century. </p>

<p>When thinking over specific
panoramas of this kind it seems proper to bear in mind Popper's
assumption that &#147;We are not students of some subject matter
but students of problems. And problems may cut right across the
borders of any subject matter or discipline.³ [2]. Then it might
be upheld that the intended Information Science will emerge
'naturally' and necessarily only when the information available
about the problems of millions and millions of men &amp; women is
employed 'cleverly' for conceiving, designing and implementing
feasible solutions, and also for improving effectively them. </p>

<p>Up to the present almost nobody
can deny the magnificent advances of most technologies produced
by the 'high intelligence' that could emerge in our planet.
Neither could it be ignored that information technology is one of
the intelligent outcomes of human brains. However, 'technology'
is intrinsically neither humanitarian nor humane, despite it is
the outcome of human thinking, reasoning &amp; action.
Consequently, supported by many evidences, it is now advisable
for many of us to engage in thinking and action for tackling the
serious survival problems that the Homo Sapiens Sapiens might be
facing in the near future, due to an undeniable fact:
&#147;Technology is 'sold' as progressive and where technology
goes society follows³ [1], but without noticing in advance that
it, the technology, is generating side effects that become an
obstacle to the evolvement of humanitarian concerns. </p>

<p>Such panoramic view, though
relatively hypothetical, obliges scientists, practitioners,
experts, educators, artists,... to search out scientifically how
to use cleverly the intellectual possibilities provided by the so
called Information Technology in order to conduct consciously and
humanly (i.e. ethically and ecologically) the evolvement of our
technological civilization. </p>

<h4><a name="business">Business Process Redesign</a></h4>

<p>Graham Orange, Peter Dixon</p>

<h5>Abstract</h5>

<p>In this paper we set out to
describe a research project upon which we have recently embarked.
The project involves six different organisations, five commercial
enterprises and two academic institutions. Our research is
centred a-round the construction industry and will be seeking to
integrate cross organisational functions and build an environment
of trust and co-operation between the collaborating companies
through the implementation of new working relationships and
practices supported by the introduction of information
technology. </p>

<p>This paper examines some of the
current research relating to the research project. We explore the
areas of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Interorganisation
Systems (IOS), information strategy, business process redesign
and then examine the important relationships between each of
these elements. We then look at how this research fits within the
context of our own research project and within the construction
industry. </p>

<p>There are five commercial
organisations collaborating in the project. The principal
organisation is Taylor Wood-row Construction Ltd. The other
organisations include two of Taylor Woodrow¹s major customers; a
large retail outlet and Thames Water, a large publicly owned
utility; the remaining two organisations are consultants in the
design and economics of construction projects. Each organisation
has a major role to play in the design process of a construction
project. The success of the project is dependent upon
organisations such as these working in partnership. </p>

<p>The research will be primarily
carried out by the two academic institutions; The London School
of Economics and Leeds Metropolitan University, with additional
re-searchers provided by Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd. </p>

<p>Es gibt ein Umdenken, nicht nur
in der Informatik, auch in anderen Disziplinen, in denen der
Informationsbegriff eine zentrale Rolle spielt. Der Bedarf dafür
ergibt sich aus den Transformationsprozessen, denen unsere
Gesellschaften unterliegen und die durch die rasanten
Entwicklungen auf dem Gebiet der IuK-Technologien angestoßen
werden ­ Prozesse, die aber eher spontan und unbewußt verlaufen
und nicht von einer ebensolchen raschen Entwicklung
wissenschaftlicher Einsicht, ganz zu schweigen von Voraussicht,
begleitet werden: Es gibt keine Wissenschaft von der
Informationsgesellschaft. </p>

<p>Bereits vor fünf Jahren begann
ein Umdenkprozeß bei Forscher und Forscherinnen, die merkten
daß ihre Überlegungen die Grenzen ihrer Fächer zu
überschreiten beginnen. Zu ihnen gehören Mike Conrad von der
Wayne State University, Koichiro Matsuno von der Technischen
Universität Nagaoka und Pedro Marijuán von der Universität von
Zaragoza, alle an der Schnittstelle
Computerwissenschaften/Biologie arbeitend. Sie luden zur ersten
internationalen Konferenz über die Grundlagen der
Informationswissenschaft 1994 in Madrid ein. Die Semiotik, die
Systemtheorie, die allgemeine Evolutionstheorie wurden in Gestalt
einiger ihrer wissenschaftlichen Organisationen in die
Vorbereitung der FIS 96, der Second Conference on the Foundations
of Information Science, einbezogen, als deren Gastgeberin die
Abteilung für Sozialkybernetik, der TU Wien fungierte. </p>

<p>Gefragt wurde nach einer
vereinheitlichten Theorie der Information. Es ist für mich nur
natürlich, wenn am Tagungsort Wien, wo einstmals die
Einheitswissenschaft verkündet wurde und der Evolutionsgedanke
nach wie vor lebendig ist, das Angebot unterbreitet wurde, die
Bestrebungen zur Reformulierung der Informationstheorie in die
allgemeinen Umbrüche einzubetten, von denen die Natur- wie die
Gesellschaftswissenschaften, die Querschnitts- und
Formalwissenschaften und die Philosophie erfaßt werden, und die
entsprechende Hintergrundtheorie einer erst zu schaffenden
allgemeinen Theorie der Information in einer evolutionären
Systemtheorie zu suchen, die, um die Begriffe Komplexität und
Selbstorganisation herum, gleichfalls noch auszuarbeiten ist. </p>

<p>In diesem Sinne möchte ich die
mit dieser Ausgabe des INFORMATIK FORUM vorgelegten Artikel, die
in Zusammenhang mit der FIS 96 entstanden sind, verstehen. Es
geht ums Zuhörenkönnen, um den Versuch, das zu verstehen, von
dem der andere meint, daß es nicht nur in seiner eigenen
Disziplin von Bedeutung ist. Die hier vorgestellten Beiträge
kommen aus Fächern, die zusammen einem Querschnitt durch den
heutigen Wissenschaftsbetrieb gleichkommen: Physik, Biologie,
Psychologie, Soziologie, Technik, Philosophie. Nur wenn wir uns
einen trans-disziplinären Blick aneignen, werden wir befähigt,
mit den Herausforderungen, vor die uns die Wissenschafts- wie die
Gesellschaftsentwicklung stellen, umzugehen. </p>
