    <p>In light of current developments in the natural and human sciences, evolution promises
    to become a key element of the new scientific paradigm. Because of the invatiances of
    change and development discovered inthe various disciplines investigating the behavior of
    complex systems, the evolutionary paradigm satisfies a basic search for meaning,
    transcending the limited meanings that attach to particular areas of inquiry.</p>

    <p>Information is intrinsically about a physical phenomenon that precipitates a globally
    synchronous time internally, in sharp cantrast to Newtonian physics in which the globally
    synchronous time is simply declared to be absolute from the outset as being a netaphysical
    entity. Both capacities of generative activity and prescriptive specification are evident
    in the physics of information addressing the construction of a globally synchronous time
    from locally asynchronous ones on the actual scene. Appraisal of a locally asynchronous
    time assigned to each local material configuration is practiced by focusing on the
    accurence of signaling and communication on material grounds. In this regard, the
    Cartesian physics prior to Newtonian successor is perceptive enough to appreciate the
    significance of signaling and communication in the local perspective. Proper understanding
    of the issue of information can be accomplished only by ameliorating Newtonian
    interventions too much of a metaphysical flavor. Information requires and waits for
    ressurection of the Cartesian physics. </p>

<h4>Antonio Drago and Emanuele Drago</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>Information Science as a Paradigmatic Instance of a
    Problem-Based Theory</b> <p><small>Department of Physical
    Sciences - University Federico II, Naples; v. F. M. Briganti 412, 80141, Naples</p>
    <p>It is apparently organized in a different way than the Aristotelian ideal, i.e., by
    means of an infinite sequence of deductive inferences from few selfevident principles. In
    the past, several authoritative scholars on the foundations of science - in particular, E.
    W. Beth - emphasized the misleading preconception of this unique ideal of organization of
    scientific theory. <br>
    From a historical analysis on mathematical theories and physical theories evidence is
    collected for a new ideal of organization of a scientific theory. It was promoted by
    D'Alembert and then substantiated by the theories of classical chemistry, Lazare Carnot's
    geometry, calculus and mechanics, Sadi Carnot's thermodynamics, Lobachevsky's
    non-Euclidean geometry, Galois' theory-by bounding our list to the theories till up the
    first half of the 19th Century. <br>
    By a comparison of such theories one obtains the following common features. The core of
    the theory is constituted by an universal problem (in S. Carnot's thermodynamics, the
    maximum efficiency of the heat conversion in work) whose solution is not at hand of the
    current science. In order to solve this problem a new scientific method is looked for. The
    starting point of this method is constituted by a double negated statement (in the
    previous theory, &quot;It is impossible the motion without an end&quot;), whose
    corresponding positive statement lacks of scientific evidence (&quot;each motion will
    end&quot; can be stated neither by a finite set of experiments nor by calculations).
    Hence, the law Ø Ø A=A fails, as it is the case in the intuitionistic logic or, more in
    general, in a non-classical logic. Such a double negated statement surely does not play
    the role of an axiom-principle because no anlytical consequences may be drawn from it. As
    a consequence, the full deductive scheme does not apply in just the starting step. Rather,
    it constitutes a methodological principle, from which an ad absurdum theorem follows (in
    S.Carnot's thermodynamics: Carnot's theorem), which reaches an universal conclusion (the
    highest efficiency of whatsoever process of heat conversion) which now constitutes the
    hard fact upon which one may deductively develop the subsequent theory.<br>
    A program for discovering new foundations for the IT is illustrated according to the ideal
    of a problem-based theory. In particular, it is suggested the main problem under the form
    of a double negated statement, the character of an ab absurdo theorem is stressed for
    Shanon Theorem; and the role played by the symmetries in founding IT is suggested.</p>

  <li><b>A Rudimentary Theory of Information: Consequences for
    Information Science and Information Systems</b> <p><small>Kingston
    University, Kingston upon Thames, KT1 2EE, England.<br>
    E-mail: <a href="mailto:petros@kingston.ac.uk">petros@kingston.ac.uk</a></p>
    <p>The key fundamental notions of Information Science and Information Systems are
    'information' and 'information system' respectively, with information the central common
    notion. Nevertheless, despite the huge literature on both 'information' and 'information
    system' their nature remains debatable and their conceptual nexus to each other and
    related notions like 'sign' and 'meaning' are, at best, fuzzy or incomplete.<br>
    The aim of this paper is no briefly review the notions of 'information' and 'information
    system' and to outline a theory of information. Specifically, in section one, we provide a
    brief analysis of 'information system' and a summary presentation of the major views on
    the nature of 'information', concluding that: (i) 'information' and 'communication'
    constitute the backbone of any theory of information; and (ii) all the relevant studies of
    information are fragmented, failing to provide a unifying theory and, in particular, to
    clarify the highly debatable nature of information. In section two, we provide the
    elements of a rudimentary theory of information and draw some of the consequences of this
    preliminary body of knowledge for Information Science and Information Systems.</p>

  <li><b>What is a Possible Ontological and Epistemological
    Framework for a True Universal 'Information Science'?: The Suggestion of Cybersemiotics</b> <p><small>The Royal School of Librarianship, Aalborg Branch, Langagervej

    <p>The subject of the article is what the paradigmatic framework for a universal
    information science or informatics should be and what kind of science we can expect it to
    be. The mechanistic and rationalistic information processing paradigm of cognitive science
    is the dominating research program in this research area which is heavily dominated by
    computer science and informatics. It is pointed out that this logical and mechanistic
    approach is unable to give an understanding of human signification and its basis in the
    connotations of biological and social relationships. The paper then discusses - on the
    basis of previous work - the ontological and epistemological problems of the idea of
    &quot;information science&quot; and constructs an alternative non-mechanistic view based
    on the idea of autopoiesis of second order cybernetics and Peirce's concept of chaos and
    evolution. These ideas are related to the cybersemiotic framework for transdisciplinary
    research of information and communication which the author has developed in other papers.
    Cybersemiotics is an integration of second order cybernetics, Peirce's triadic semiosis
    and Wittgenstein's theory of language game to a non-Cartesian cognitive science.</p>

    <p>The present publication is a contribution to the development of a unified concept of
    information. The paper begins with a short survey of the history of the concept of
    information. Then a list of open questions, something like a specification for the
    definition of the concept of information, will be given, followed by a summary of a new
    approach developed in [Flückiger 1995], enabling us to provide an answer to each of these
    questions. This approach takes its cue from modern neurobiology according to which all
    things perceived or thought by an individual are to be understood as constructed by the
    brains of these individuals. Using a thought experiment, it is shown how the gap between
    the seemingly contradictory statements of two very different information theories can be
    narrowed until they are finally reconciled on the basis of the new approach presented
    here.</p>

    <p>It is tried to show that pragmatic information as a generalised concept of information
    plays a role as an interacting meaningful entity between systems. Systems are sources of
    information and information is able to build up systems. Therefore system and information

    <p>It is discussed why and how epistemological arguments are halpful for systematic and
    formal progress toward a proper understanding of complex systems, beyond their
    phenomenological features. Two crucial notions in this context are those of the Cartesian
    cut between the material world and its non-material counterpart, and the Heisenberg cut
    between and object and its enviroment. Corresponding to the issues of model building and
    measurement, the two cuts are of utmost but most often imlicit significance for modern
    science. Taking them into account explicitly can contribute to a resolution of certain
    problems in the study of complex systems. An immediate application refers to two
    fundamentally different concepts of complexity which are related to two fundamentally
    different concepts of information.</p>

    axiomatic base of information science. A new framework is proposed that subsumes the
    traditional definitions as a special case. <br>
    The information theory of Shannon (and its derivatives) nicely cover the formal,
    state-determined domains for which they were crafted. Subsequent developments, primarily
    in evolutionary biology, cybernetics and systems theory have shown that the nature of
    living systems is such that traditional informational views cannot account for the salient
    phenomena; and that these accounts cannot be (re)constructed at higher (meta) levels of
    abstraction. <br>
    Following the work of Csanyi and Kampis, a distinction is drawn between referential and
    nonreferential information. This typology is further extended to include statereferential
    information as a means of accounting for the entailment relationships between different
    types of informational processes. The statereferential type subsumes the traditional
    definitions, and positions the current information sciences and technologies within the
    overall framework.<br>
    A synthesis of the above work results in information being defined as the organizing
    property of living (social) systems. This property is constituted of cohesive, selective,
    and active information types. Cohesive information (statereferential) provides cohesion
    across space and time, selective (nonreferential) is boundary enforcing, and active
    (referential) is process sustaining.<br>
    The theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of the proposed definitions
    (and resulting conceptual framework) are briefly discussed.</p>

    <p>The goal of the following reflexions is to introduce the concept of Field of
    Interaction as integral part of all open and self-organized systems and to show that the
    concept is useful to understand the emergence of information and the process of
    interaction between these kind of systems. The concept is based on the fact that these
    systems are obliged to interact with a certain part of their relevant environment to
    sustain their own structural self-organization through the process of input and output of
    energy and matter. This process of interaction produces signals (changes, transformations,
    differences, etc..) in a part of its environment, called field of interaction. The
    ensemble of all the signals (changes produced by the system-structure itself as well as
    changes caused by alien influences) we call potential information. The microscopic
    coherency of the structural organization of open systems is based on a basic principle,
    the structural information. As open systems are sustained by a permanently changing
    flow-through of energy, structural information is submitted to a continuous microscopic
    adaptation to macroscopic changes.The logic of the way how the system reacts as
    macroscopic unity is called pragmatic information.<br>
    The interaction of two (or more) open systems is possible if there is some overlapping of
    their fields of interaction to establish a channel. The channel can be compared to a
    common &#132;pool of signals&quot; where all participating systems import signals from
    other &#132;partners&quot; and deposit their own ones. Exchange of signals and structural
    compatibility are the basic conditions to produce interaction and coherency between open
    systems.</p>

    <p>The goal of this article is to subsume the concept of information under a more general
    heading. One basic notion which can be generally applied is the term
    &quot;causality&quot;. This concept is used in everyday language, in mythological
    thinking, and in scientific languages as well. Therefore there exists some chance to adapt
    it to the context of information, to extend it towards our needs, and to explicate it more
    precisely. We think it promising to look for information under this perspective, and to
    work out the differences, similarities, and the particularities of causality of
    information processes compared to purely physical ones. The advantage of this perspective
    is the unfolding of a larger range of analysis than is opened by physics. It allows for
    the inclusion of different causal relations which cannot be viewed by classical physics.</p>

    <p>The concepts of &quot;limit&quot; and &quot;barrier&quot; have moved to the focus of
    attention in a number of fields in the natural and social sciences. Division of
    intellectual labour - itself the product of a limit-creating move in the social
    manufacture of knowledge - has made it difficult to develop transdisciplinary approaches
    to the problems at hand. The paradigm of &quot;information science&quot; will provide
    opportunities for more global perspectives on the function of limits and barriers in
    fields of intellectual and social action. In this paper a first attempt will be made at
    presenting a theory of barriers for information science.<br>
    The entropic economy of &quot;nature&quot; has an absolute limit because of the laws of
    thermodynamics. In the long run, a level of minimized general energy will be reached and
    all local disequilibria will have been erased. (But then, &quot;in the long run&quot; we
    are all dead.) This &quot;ideal&quot; world of thermodynamics operates against a
    background of the continued creation of energetic subsystems that seem to insulate
    themselves against the general trend. One of these subsystems is commonly called
    &quot;life&quot;. Barriers in a plethora of forms play a decisive role in this process,
    ranging from membranes to autopoetic feedback loops. &quot;Information&quot; plays a
    decisive role in the development of local disequilibria.<br>
    The role of barriers in social systems has been amply demonstrated and will thus be dealt
    with summarily in this paper. The problematics of &quot;inside-outside&quot; defines a
    crucial point in the developmen of any social formation. It will be argued that the
    &quot;foreigner&quot; (xenos) articulates a complex cognitive and social field. The often
    competing strategies informing the &quot;inside-outside&quot;-matrix of a particular
    community will be examined. It will be argued that the psychoanalytic concept of the
    &quot;other&quot; has considerable metatheorerical potential for a general theory of
    &quot;information.&quot;<br>
    The main focus of the paper will be on the importance of &quot;barriers&quot; in processes
    of the social manufacture of knowledge. It will be argued that a theory of
    &quot;barriers&quot; is motivated by a number of seemingly diverse areas, such as gestalt
    psychology and Goedel's theorems on undecidability. Information processing environments
    have to supply tools or mechanisms for creating &quot;barriers&quot;. The need for a type
    of general &quot;locality&quot; indicator runs through a large number of intellectual
    projects. Finally, proposals will be made how &quot;barriers&quot; can be integrated into
    a more global theory of the situatedness of knowledge. In a self-reflexive turn, general
    information science will radically deconstruct the concept of &quot;generality&quot; in
    science.</p>

    <p>I have argued for the reality of a second law of infodynamics. That is, that the

    as the system supports internal observation. I will be concerned here with matters of
    scale, as well as with system senescence (rigidity produced by the asymptotic approach to
    maximum information storage within a system). My major categories derive from a view of
    system development, and are: immaturity, maturity and senescence. As an immature system
    grows in size, it deploys information over ever smaller scales as it transforms from the
    vagueness of immaturity toward ever more definite embodiment. This eventually results in
    an information overload, gradually eroding system adaptability as it increasingly inhibits
    the variety of system responses by limiting its ability to further qualify stored
    information.</p>

    and information is studied. Following Wiener information is considered as a non-physical
    quantity, not matter or energy. Information is understood as a binary relation between a
    sender and a receiver. We differ between bound and free information. Information can be
    created by selforganization, historically it is connected with the origin of life. The
    structure and predictability of informational strings is investigated. For example we
    study symbolic sequences generated by evolution, as e.g. texts. It is shown that several
    information carriers show criticality connected with the existence of long-range
    correlations, long memory in time and historical behaviour (self-tuned criticality). The
    higher order Shannon entropies and the conditional entropies (dynamical entropies and

    <p>An approach to quantum phenomena is reviewed that deals with the possibility of their
    realistic interpretation in the sense that they represent manifestations of hermeneutic
    circles between quantum &quot;objects&quot; and their experimental boundary conditions.
    Quantum cybernetics provides an evolutionary perspective in that all higher-level
    organizations like molecules, cells, living systems, etc., can be discussed under one and
    the same systemic viewpoint: a hermeneutic circularity between a &quot;core&quot; (or
    &quot;nucleus&quot;) and a relevant &quot;periphery&quot; (or &quot;environment&quot;)
    which constitutes the systems' organization and information potential. <br>
    Generally, in realistic theories, an individual quantum system is analyzable into a local
    &quot;particle-like&quot; nonlinearity of a generally nonlocal &quot;wave-like&quot; mode
    of some sub-quantum structure of the vacuum (&quot;Dirac ether&quot;). In this view, a
    &quot;particle&quot; can be considered as being &quot;guided&quot; along one specific
    route by the (generally nonlocal) configurations of superimposed waves, which spread along
    all possible paths of an experimental setup. Moreover, in the approach of Quantum
    Cybernetics, an additional focus is given on the fact that the energy and momentum of a
    particle also determine the wave behavior. Thus, &quot;waves&quot; and
    &quot;particles&quot; are mutually and self-consistently defined, and Quantum Cybernetics
    puts particular emphasis on the circular relationship - mediated by plane waves - between
    a quantum system and its macroscopically defined boundary conditions.</p>

    <p>The paper starts with a critics of the potential information which is related to the
    statistical entropy. In order to include the syntactic and semantic aspects of
    information, we propose a distinction between structural and functional information,
    instead. Structural information represents the structural determination of a system state,
    it measures the content of information, as given by the material structure. Functional
    information, on the other hand, represents the operational closure of the system, it could
    be e.g. an algorithm which activates and interprets the existing structural information.
    &gt;From an evolutionary point of view, pragmatic information is generated by an interplay
    of structural and functional information. This leads to a new insight into the concept of
    pragmatic information, which is not an invariant of evolution, but must be steadily
    re-generated. <br>
    The active role of information in a self-organization process is demonstrated in a model
    of artificial agents. It is shown by means of computer simulations that the feedback of
    already existing informa-tion on the generation of new information performs analogies to
    the creation of a collective memory.</p>

    function, its relation to space and time, its origination, the function and for-mation of
    values, the special form of the universal interconnection - Form (Syntax), Content
    (Semantics) and Effect (Pragmatics). Today, it becomes increasingly clear that different
    concepts based on each other have developed for understanding the phenomenon of
    information: 1. The structural under-stand-ing of information 2. The func-tional
    understanding of information 3. The evolutionary understand-ing of information. <br>
    The evolutionary stages concept of information aims at achieving a new understanding of
    information through a theory of evolu-tionary systems and a specific description of new
    phenomena in the language of the relevant field of science. Information is originating,
    there is no immediate reception of information, which is already existing, from the outer

    <p>By spanning the traditional scientific theories in the search for an epistemological
    home for information it is found that Physics (together with some inputs from Automata
    Theory) provides the criteria to identify the universals that characterize information
    processors. It is well known, however, that Physics and Mathematics alone are insufficient
    to answer some fundamental questions that arise in further speculations on the subject of
    information. It seems that Biology, in the realm of Evolution Theory and in terms of
    Natural Selection, is at present the only place able to offer the objective context
    required to properly characterize information as an object of scientific inquiry. <br>
    In this communication we intend to show, by establishing a working equivalence between the
    epistemological questions that should characterize a theory of information and those
    questions that characterize the science of Biology, how a science of information can be
    more objectively characterized. It is only by referring to the selective pressures that we
    can solve the otherwise unanswerable philosophical quiestion of whether it is possible to
    know if two players of a game are, in fact, playing the same game (the semantic question).
    It is also shown that it is possible, by using conventional criteria, to establish a
    phylogenesis of information processors from where we conclude that every information
    processor now existing in the universe (even computers and robots) has an ancestor that
    has once been a living being. <br>
    It is here suggested, however, that Biology is only a provisory epistemological ground for

    <p>The evolution of consciousness is seen in the context of energy driven evolution in
    general in which energy and information, or the in-forming of complex structure, are seen
    as two sides of the same coin. From this perspective consciousness is viewed as an
    ecological system in which streams of cognitive, perceptual, and emotional information
    form a rich complex of interactions, analogous to the interactive matabolism of a living
    cell. The result is an organic, self-generating, or autopoietic, system, continuously in
    the act of creating itself. Evidence suggests that this process is chaotic, or at least
    chaotic-like, and capable of assuming a number of distinct statesbest understood as
    chaotic attractors. Such systems do not exist in isolation, but function most normally in
    hypercomplex attractor patterns termed societies.</p>

    <p>The evolution of biological (intermediary) complexity strongly depends upon the
    information-processing advantages it confers to cells and organisms. Highly complex
    biological structures such as the cellular signaling system and the vertebrate nervous
    system have been developed in order to inform the living system about its surround,
    subsequently orienting the internal, productive activities. The evolutionary success of
    these types of informational structures (&quot;infostructures&quot;) exemplifies that,
    almost universally, the &quot;bit&quot; may act as a successful substitute for the
    &quot;joule&quot;. Recent molecular biology research on cellular signaling systems has
    disclosed their amazing information-processing sophistication and the crucial role they
    play in the formation and functioning of the vertebrate brain. In the neurosciences,
    duality theory has highlighted the way in which the cortical maps and the cerebral
    substructures of the vertebrate brain are &quot;topologically&quot; integrated in order to
    perform an adaptive information-processing. The development of comprehensive
    conceptualizations relating brain processing and intracellular processing may well be a
    strategic step in the development of a vertical &quot;information science&quot;.</p>

  <li><b>The Feigenbaum Scenario in a Unified Science of Life
    and Mind</b> <p><small>C. G. Jung Institute of Los Angeles,
    USA </p>
    <p>In exploring the possibilities for creating a model of the creative cosmos, it is
    important to seek mathematical models that can express the common relationships unifying
    the sciences of matter, life and mind. Current candidates for such all embracing
    mathematical models come from the burgeoning fields of non-linear dynamics that are
    described under varying labels as Chaos Theory, Self-Organization Theory and Adaptive
    Complexity Theory. In this paper we will limit ourselves to only one mathematical model
    called, &quot;The Feigenbaum Scenario.&quot; A major virtue of The Feigenbaum Scenario is
    that it is very easy to understand by non-mathematicians and it has led to new depths of
    profound understanding in a wide variety of the physical and biological sciences.
    Everything from purely mechanical systems, fluid dynamics and the weather to the patterns
    of biological growth in nature and the dynamics of heart, hormone and brain rhythms have
    been found to exhibit aspects of the Feigenbaum scenario. We explore the possibility that
    the Feigenbaum scenario can be extended to experiences of mind, sensation, perception and
    human behavior as well. We conclude that a major function of consciousness may be to
    transform the non-linear, irrational, unconscious and difficult to predict dynamics of
    unconscious nature into the more linear, rational and predictable psychodynamics that make
    human experience and social life possible.</p>

    <p>The result of using Eigen &amp; Winkler's LIFE/DEATH GAME to integrate Rashevksy's
    social physics and Rapoport's mathematical game theory, synchrony removes the
    arbitrariness from problems of ethics. It focuses on the primary conflicts between
    strategies that optimize individual survival and those that optimize survival of groups.
    According to synchrony, cooperation is an optimal strategy, not because cooperation
    conforms to some ethical pattern, but because the evolution of our technical societies has
    made the alternatives to cooperation potentially lethal at all levels of human
    interaction. Eigen &amp; Winkler offer hypercycles as a possible method of resolving
    problems that conventional wisdom has labeled &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot; <br>
    Combined with the findings of clinical psychologist Paul Meehl and cultural anthropologist
    Magoroh Maruyama, Eigen &amp; Winkler's LIFE/DEATH Game indicates that a pattern of
    reasoning, called Alpha-H, is not only a formidable obstacle to cooperation, it threatens
    contemporary societies with extinction through violent conflicts, social upheavals
    economic collapse or all three together. <br>
    The Demotion of Alpha-H argues that an inability to deal constructively with change and/or
    diversity is Alpha-H's fatal flaw. And the removal of gender bias toward opponent
    processes reasoning is a crucial step toward correcting it. The key concept is the

    Paradigm</b> <p><small>Computer and Information Science
    Department, The University of Michigan-Dearborn, Dearborn, Michigan 48128</p>
    <p>The function support paradigm of information systems development seeks to exploit the
    potential synergy that can be obtained by making the information processing system an
    integral part of organizational function. This requires for the information processing
    system to be embedded into the structure and dynamics underlying the function it supports.
    This is shown to be the case in natural systems, where the synergy is obtained through the
    compatibility of information processing with the structure and dynamics of the overall
    system. <br>
    Current approaches to the development of information systems do not consider, in a
    sufficiently explicit manner, the structure and dynamics of organizations as a determinant
    of their information processing requirements. As a consequence, the resulting information
    systems usually do not provide the required level of support. We argue that, to be
    effective, man-made information systems must also be compatible with the organizational
    functions they support. The contribution of the information system to the adaptability of
    the organization as a whole is proposed as a broad but robust and effective measure of its
    effectiveness.</p>

    <p>The three lineages of information, - the genetic, the cultural and artifactual - will
    increasingly merge their constituent information contents through advances in
    biotechnology and information technology. This will redefine what constitutes &quot;
    social&quot; and what constitutes &quot;community.&quot; A community's members communicate
    with their &quot;significant others&quot; and change their internal information states
    (and their internal and external behaviors). Under conditions of merging, information
    exchanges occur across all the three lineages. In this sense, the concept of significant
    other, - that is, a communicating entity -, is now spread from human communities to
    encompass also the biological and the artifactual. A seamless merging between the three
    realms now occurs affecting their respective internal information stores. The resulting
    image of interactions that now arises is of multiple oceans of communities, operating at
    different levels, the genetic, the cultural and the artifactual. There are exchanges
    across the different levels, up and down and sideways, as information is translated from
    one realm to the other. These dynamics result in changes in the evolutionary
    characteristics of each lineage and sub-lineage, including the internal perceptions from
    within a lineage, namely in the language of evolutionary epistemology, its &quot;
    meanings&quot; and &quot;hypotheses&quot; on the world. A future sociology must
    necessarily take into account these factors and incorporate the dynamics of all three

    <p>Information is power. There are several theoretical considerations which guide the
    basic research on information societz and its evolution. Some of them, worked out in this
    paper, deal with the role of social variety in the process of post-industrial evolution.
    Exploring similarities in bio-genetic information, the process of social transformation is
    approached by using social system theory. With certain analogies to biological
    transformations - mutations - important elements for the transformation of
    information-guided behaviour systems (cultures) may be observed. They create a variety of
    elements (sub-systems), which respond for changes in the social layout of all kinds of
    organisations like states, partys, groups, insofar as there changes aim the optimation of
    functional effectivity in dependence of the variety and its use by a social system's
    elements (events, acts). By information processing, collectivities are able to explote
    even subtile fluctuations in socio-cultural information variety to &quot;cause&quot;
    changes. Collectivities are able to instruct and functionalase emerging information
    through feedback in such a way, that they get better chances to reach certain local values
    of selection. They are fitter in the sence of better instructed. This process is
    self-organised, based on the principle of selection, so that the system chooses out of a
    complex landscape of values trough communication of measuring parameters like
    &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. The value-system is learned through socialisation
    and changed by social experience. <br>
    If social change and variety are optimised, the replication of the system works close to a
    &quot;treshold of error&quot;, that means that transformation processes are driven to a
    dynamic equilibrium between stability and creativity. A variety of new transfornation
    operators emerges. Operators of the former dominant information code are still
    reproducted, but a lot of other alternatives, stablished by mutual separation are also
    represented on a survivable concentration and quantity. The competition between there new
    operators can be transformed in cooperation by their cyclic boundage in networks.</small></p>

    <p>The German Council for Research, Technology and Innovation defines the
    &#132;information society&quot; as a type of society where the acquirement, storage,
    processing, exchange, diffusion and utilization of knowledge inclusive of their
    technological possibilities of interactive communication, here become increasingly
    important. In this notion, knowledge has become the decisive factor for economic growth
    and technological advance. As a social scientist I transform the term &#132;information
    society&quot; into processes of automatization of knowledge, which is called its
    informatization and computerization. It is argued that these processes affect the societal
    condition of knowledge in that the part of knowledge relating to the contents diminishes
    while the importance of the technical and/or formal part increases. In contrast to the
    claim of many social scientists, this trend does not lead to a superficial or shallow type
    of kowledge. What is changing is the social requirement of professional skills and
    qualifications. The great looming question about information society then is: Which
    knowledge do people need to behave competentely, effectively and successfully in a world
    full of computers? The structure of this article is as follows. First I will have a look
    at the micro-level of the composition of knowledge, next I will proceed to the historical
    shift from subject-specific knowledge to media-competence and finally I will talk about

    <p>The noosphere vision of the two great natural scientists and thinkers Teilhard de
    Chardin and V.I.Vernadski is presented critically. Their basic ideas are discussed from
    the viewpoint of present-day insights in natural science and of the world-wide information
    and communication technology. To date very little has become known about their mutual
    influence on each other. It is advocated that the development of a noosphere can be
    supported by the networking and globalization of information and communi-cation
    techniques. The noosphere is a sphere of human mind and of work, but it must not be
    identified with this modern technological trend that is changing all sectors of our life.
    A reference is made to Teil-hard de Chardin`s warnings against individualism, nationalism
    and racism, as well as Stalinism as se-ductive erroneous developments. The fundamentally
    teleological vision is contrasted with the idea of creativity in nature and in man.
    Delimiting conditions, such as structure, information, and at the level of society, the
    free will of man who has become aware of himself - humanist values, are considered. All of
    them operate to limit the number of possibilities for development that are derived from
    the creativity of nature and man. Thus, new possibilities for development emerge at a
    higher level. The utilisation of technology must be really oriented to human beings among
    human beings. Only with a strong internal determination of the social processes by
    understanding the genuine existence as man will it be possible to master the ambivalence
    of its effects and to come closer towards a society with deepened human in-formation and
