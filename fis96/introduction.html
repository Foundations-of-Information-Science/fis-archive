<h4>Introduction</h4>


<p>We are witnesses to the start of a new phase of

technological organisation, especially in developed societies &#150; a phase which we are

used to calling the information age. But at the beginning of this age of information

societies, the following discrepancy between the socio-political/technological and

inner-scientific development can be seen. </p>


<p>On the one hand there are transformation processes to

which our societies are subject, and which seem to be pushed forward by the breakneck pace

of developments in information and communication technologies. Though these processes are

strongly supported by regional and national technology advancement programmes, they tend

to proceed spontaneously, without our full awareness, and are not accompanied by an

equally rapid growth in scientific insight, let alone foresight. Attempts to observe and

understand the nature of this change and its far-reaching consequences have taken second

place. There is no science of the information society, since a scientific understanding of

this new form of society has not had time to develop. </p>


<p>In the academic sphere, on the other hand, there is a

search for unifying concepts in the various disciplines of natural sciences, in system

theory, cybernetics and evolution theory and, beyond that, a tendency towards an

interdisciplinary or even transdisciplinary approach. The goal is thus compatibility of

theories and generalisation of their results, without there having been a paradigm change,

however, in those disciplines which are concerned in one way or another with information

processes, and which are rich in number, as the term &quot;information&quot; has entered

into so many sciences. There is no general theory of information that deserves to be so

called. </p>


<p>Thus &quot;information science&quot; seems an idea whose

time has come: a discipline which rests upon a unified concept of information in order to

enable us to cope with the challenges facing the emerging information societies on a

global scale. </p>


<p>And information science is about to take shape. Whilst at

the end of the last war the concept of information was still seen largely from a limited

and one-sided military viewpoint, scientific debate on the topic has since then been

dominated by attempts to move away from these limitations and see the subject in a

different way. Shannon's syntactic definition was thus followed by attempts to formulate a

semantically-based term (most notably by Carnap and Bar-Hillel) and a pragmatically-based

term (of which Weizsäcker is seen as the most prominent proponent). Since then, there has

been a search for a concept which can integrate the various aspects of information

processes, include the useful findings of the old term as a special case, and extend the

old information theory into a new, universal theory. </p>


<p>The early nineties saw the beginning of efforts to

establish an exchange of ideas between researchers who are trying to create a new

understanding of existing information science(s) and related disciplines, or are

attempting the foundation of a new, trans-disciplinary science, and wish to document and

present this change of view to the scientific community, brought about by the realisation

that their considerations were breaking out of the boundaries of their respective fields.

Scientists and scholars from the most varied of disciplines, not only from Europe but also

from the USA and Japan, took part in this discussion. Their efforts resulted in the

organisation of a series of conferences. </p>


<p>The First Conference on the Foundations of Information

Science, which took place in 1994 in Madrid, was the brainchild of Pedro C. Marijuán from

Spain, Michael Conrad from the USA, and Koichiro Matsuno from Japan; its most important

representatives included Johan De Vree from the Netherlands and Tom Stonier from the

United States. As the subtitle of that conference announced (&quot;From Computers and

Quantum Physics to Cells, Nervous Systems, and Societies&quot;), it was an exploratory

attempt to give coherence to the many threads in widely separated disciplines that

converge on information. So to speak, the possibility of a &quot;vertical&quot; science

devoted to information (&quot;information science&quot;) was positively contemplated by

practitioners in fields as diverse as computer science (M. Conrad), quantum physics and

biophysics (K. Matsuno, E. Liberman), computational biology (P. Marijuán, R. Paton, Y.

Gunji), neurosciences (P. Arhem, P. Erdi), social sciences (J. De Vree), and

interdisciplinary scholars (T. Stonier, G. Kampis) as well.</p>


<p>The Second Conference on the Foundations of Information

Science, held in 1996 in Vienna, represented the next step in that very direction. It was

an attempt at closing down the foundational discussions and starting up a new type of

transdisciplinary work, thus bringing together Snow&#146;s two cultures, the so-called

&#132;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; sciences, and opening up the more

technical/scientific disciplines. There were participants not only from computer sciences,

physics, biology, mathematics, logic and systems science, but also from psychology,

sociology, economic science, linguistics, philosophy, and the area of

science-technology-society. In particular, the Vienna conference succeeded in drawing the

following additional scientific circles into the arena: 


<ul>

  <li>The evolutionary theorists, in particular experts from the

    General Evolutionary Research Group, led by Ervin Laszlo (Italy), and including Werner

    Ebeling (Berlin) as principal representative of the theory of self-organization;</li>

  <li>The system theorists, including Klaus Kornwachs&#146;

    group (Cottbus), which promotes the so-called &#132;pragmatic information&quot; theory;</li>

  <li>The semioticians, among them Søren Brier (Aalborg), who

    uses system and evolutionary theories in studying sign processes.</li>

</ul>


<p>The conference was hosted by the Social Cybernetics Group

at the Institute of Design and Technology Assessment at the Department of Computer

Science, Vienna University of Technology. Vienna was the ideal meeting place for such a

gathering, for many reasons: 


<ul>

  <li>Firstly, ever since the beginnings of informatics and

    computer science, there have been efforts made in Vienna to include the societal aspects

    of the subject, as well as the purely technical ones (H. Zemanek).</li>

  <li>Secondly, the traditional vision of a &quot;unified

    science&quot; (&quot;Einheitswissenschaft&quot;) in the sense of a scientific world view

    is still held here (Vienna Circle).</li>

  <li>Thirdly, an evolutionary and historical point of view has

    long been a part of the Austrian scientific culture (Evolutionary Epistemology, R. Riedl).</li>

</ul>

<h4>Topics</h4>


<p>The discussion focused on a central theme, &quot;The

Quest for a Unified Theory of Information&quot;. In particular, the following three topics

were covered: 


<ol>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#methodologic">Methodological

    issues: what kind of philosophical and/or formal scientific suppositions seem best suited

    to serve as a basis for a unified theory of information (UTI)?</a></strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#theoretic">Theoretical

    issues: what are the distinctive features to be recognized in the genesis and the

    structure of information processing systems in the inorganic, the biotic, and the societal

    sphere and how are they related to the common features in these spheres?</a></strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#practic">Practical issues:

    what practical conclusions can be drawn from these theoretical insights as to solving

    economic, political, cultural, environmental and other problems facing information

    societies?</a></strong></li>

</ol>


<p><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#auswahl">go Back</a></strong><br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="methodologic"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></p>


<p>As to the first point, there is growing evidence that the

emerging theory of evolutionary systems will become the starting point and background

theory in the search for a UTI. Philosophically speaking, the concept of information is

closely connected with the concept of emergence of novelty. The appearance of new

qualities in the course of the history and structure of all entities &#150; be it phase

transitions in the realm of physics or transformations surveyed by social scientists - is

dealt with by a systems approach which since the seventies has been converging with

evolutionary thinking, thus gradually preparing a paradigm shift in world view which

involves philosophical considerations, too. The elaboration of a theory of evolutionary

systems offers a promising prospect of anchors for linking with informational concerns.

Insofar as self-organizing systems give rise to novelty, information processing, or rather

the generation of information, turns out to be a property of self-organizing systems. A

UTI will be a general information theory as a general theory of information-generating

systems. </p>


<p><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#topics">Back to topics</a><br>

<a href="fis96intro.html#auswahl">go Back</a></strong><br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="theoretic"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></p>


<p>As to the second point, it seems clear that the core of a

UTI is formed by a concept of information which is flexible enough to perform two

functions. It must relate to the most various manifestations of information, thus enabling

all scientific disciplines to use a common concept; at the same time, it must be precise

enough to fit the unique requirements of each individual branch of science. Thus a term is

needed which combines both the general and the specific - the general as the governing

laws of each form of information, the specific as those characteristics which make

different types of information distinct from each other. These different types of

information have to be related to, if not derived from, different types of self-organizing

systems. In this way this concept has to preserve research from falling back upon a

reductionist way of thinking as well as from postulating holistic/dualistic positions

which overestimate the divide between different qualities. As general features of any

information-generating system are expressed, depending on the material context, as

physically, chemically, biotically, or culturally differentiated properties, a UTI will -

in using theories of physics, chemistry, biology, and human and social sciences - have to

comprise special information theories as theories of particular types of

information-generating systems in order to provide proper particularization and

concretization.</p>


<p><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#topics">Back to topics</a><br>

<a href="fis96intro.html#auswahl">go Back</a></strong><br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="practic"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"> </p>


<p>As to the third point, from a UTI point of view society

is but another self-organizing system that constitutes that step in the overall evolution

which represents the most sophisticated form of information generation. Over and above

that, the question can be raised whether this form of social information processing will

by means of electronic networking, i.e. linking of humans and computers together, undergo

a transformation to a new and higher level. That is to say, will a global brain not only

be capable of monitoring the manifestations of crises in the socio-economic, technological

and environmental spheres, but also enable humans to set the world society on a path

towards sustainable development which is tantamount to a leap in societal

self-organization? Today, existing societies still lack the intelligence which they need

to secure their material reproduction in the long run. Contrary to evolutionary

information-processing systems on the pre-human level, the kind of self-organization which

is needed to overcome crises requires actions of conscious individuals and will not emerge

from technological progress alone. Thus a UTI will provide information science with a base

for drawing conclusions which may help to trigger the development of the social system as

a whole, or the human, technological, or natural systems as parts of this whole, in such a

direction that the maintenance of the overall system, and its functions critical for the

survival of mankind, are ensured.</p>

<a name="conclusion"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></p>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>


<p>However, the conference was unable to answer unambigously

the questions of whether a UTI is possible at all, and (if so) 


<ul>

  <li>if a theory of evolutionary systems represents the

    suitable foundations for this; </li>

  <li>in which way the different properties of

    information-generating self-organizing systems can be subsumed;</li>

  <li>whether the covering of the earth's surface with

    information and communication technology networks will automatically entail solutions of

    problems on a global societal scale.</li>

</ul>


<p>It has become clear, that such complicated questions

cannot be resolved by a simple show of hands at a single conference. In particular, the

rift between those disciplines which count as precise, and those which are seen as less

precise, remains to be solved. </p>


<p>So the principal achievement of the conference is to have

served as a forum for the exchange of widely differing viewpoints and to have given

participants from differing backgrounds the opportunity to deepen the mutual contacts,

which previously had hardly taken place. </p>


<p>Pedro C. Marijuán likes to compare work on the

development of information science with the building of the tower of Babel. If we stay

with the metaphor but remove ist religious element, we can however say that every

consensus reached in the debate represents a building block for the continued construction

of information science. The establishment of a scientific discussion on an international

level will enable the harmonisation of findings and interpretations. In this way, the

development of a UTI can proceed in a practical manner. </p>

<h4>Contributions</h4>


<p>The proceedings, which are given here, illustrate the

diversity of the discussions. Contributions were accepted which reflected not only

mainstream scientific research and theories of complexity and self-organization etc., but

also original and divergent ideas, bearing in mind that a unified theory must not mean

uniformity, and that variety provides the creativity necessary to gain new insights and

construct generalizations. </p>


<p>The contributions are sorted into the following five

sections: 


<ul>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#approaches">Approaches to

    unification</a></strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#concepts">Concepts of

    information</a></strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#self-organizing">Self-organizing

    systems</a></strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#life">Life and

    consciousness</a></strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="fis96intro.html#society">Society and

    technology</a></strong></li>

</ul>


<p>The first and second sections cover mostly methodological

issues, the latter also including theoretical issues on a more general level. The

remaining sections are dedicated to special theoretical issues, along the evolutionary

line of consecutive system types. The fifth section contains, beyond that, practical

issues.</p>

<a name="approaches"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></p>


<p>The first section,<b> Approaches to Unification</b>,

considers on a meta-level the meaning and status of a UTI as a kind of unified theory in

general, and in the context of the history of various scientific disciplines and theories.</p>


<p><b>Ervin Laszlo</b>, pioneer of systems philosophy and

general evolution theory, opens the discussion with <i>A Note on Evolution</i>. In this

note he clarifies the role which a proper concept of evolution plays in theorizing a

phenomenon as fundamental as information.</p>


<p><b>Rafael Capurro</b>, <b>Peter Fleissner</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wolfgang

Hofkirchner</b> started a controversial debate on the question <i>Is a Unified Theory of

Information Feasible?</i>Following the conference they began <i>A Trialogue</i> via e-mail

to discuss this issue. While Rafael Capurro points at a trilemma between univocity,

analogy and equivocity when dealing with the notion of information, Wolfgang Hofkirchner

strongly advocates the position that a UTI is not only possible but also necessary. Peter

Fleissner tries to mediate the extreme positions. </p>


<p><b>Koichiro Matsuno</b> expects and promotes the <i>Resurrection

of the Cartesian Physics</i> which was prior to Newtonian theory, because unlike ist

successor, it is sufficient to understand how signals (which are necessary for information

to be communicated) of a local character both in space and time may come to be

synchronized and globally shared in the end. Instead of addressing the construction of a

globally synchronous time from locally asynchronous ones, Newton simply declared time to

be absolute. </p>


<p><b>Antonino Drago and Emanuele Drago</b> think about the

methodological status of what hitherto used to be called information theory. They look

upon <i>Information Science as a Paradigmatic Instance of a Problem-based Theory</i>, that

is, contrary to Aristotel's ideal of deductive inferences from self-evident principles,

the theory of information which originated in a theory of communication is a

phenomenological theory which left behind physical science and made use of constructive

mathematics due to the problem it is supposed to solve.</p>


<p><b>Petros A. M. Gelepithis</b> tries to outline <i>A

Rudimentary Theory of Information</i> and to draw some of the <i>Consequences for

Information Science and Information Systems</i>. According to his definitions, what is

often called human-machine communication is, in fact, impossible. Complex human-machine

systems cannot be fully formalized, so the design of them has to include informal elements

as well.</p>


<p><b>Søren Brier</b> asks the question <i>What is a

Possible Ontological and Epistemological Framework for a True Universal &#132;Information

Science&quot;? </i>and his answer is <i>The Suggestion of Cybersemiotics</i>.

Cybersemiotics integrates second-order cybernetics, especially in the form of the idea of

autopoiesis, and Charles Sanders Peirce's concepts of the triadic semiosis and of chaos

and evolution. Thus, he argues, cognitive science (which up to now has been heavily

dominated by computer science and informatics) may avoid the mechanistic approach of the

infomation processing paradigm and contribute to the establishment of an alternative

information science. </p>


<p><b>Federico Flückiger</b>, who is in favour of

proceeding <i>Towards a Unified Concept of Information</i>, surveys the history of the

concept of information, which shows a list of unanswered questions. His <i>Presentation of

a New Approach</i> takes its cue from modern neurobiology according to which percepts are

constructions due to the brain of individuals. </p>

<a name="concepts"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></p>


<p>The second section, <b>Concepts of Information</b>, gives

an impression of the variety of conceptualization attempts which are proposed against a

background of differently accented system theories, evolution theories and semiotic

theories. At the same time, areas of contact and overlap can be seen.</p>


<p><b>Klaus Kornwachs</b> reconciles system theory and

information theory by saying that system and information are two sides of the same coin,

because systems are sources of information and information is able to build up systems: <i>System

as Information - Information as System</i>. In this way, he conceptualizes pragmatic

information.</p>


<p><b>Harald Atmanspacher</b> elaborates on <i>Cartesian

Cut, Heisenberg Cut, and the Concept of Complexity</i>. He stresses the importance of

epistemological considerations and argues in favour of taking into account the Cartesian

cut between the material world and its nonmaterial counterpart, as well as the Heisenberg

cut between an object and its environment, when studying complex systems. Different

concepts of complexity go hand in hand with different concepts of information.</p>


<p><b>Jiayin Min</b> tries to interrelate the <i>Definition,

Origin and Evolution</i> of <i>Information</i> and the concept of general evolution,

according to which evolution led from field to energy to matter to information to

consciousness. To him, information originates together with life-systems in the ability of

self-replication. </p>


<p><b>Bela Antal Banathy</b> proposes <i>A Unifying Typology

of Information</i>. His differentiation of the quality of information extends the

distinction between referential and nonreferential information (which was drawn by George

Kampis and Vilmos Csanyi) to include statereferential information. Thus he defines

information as the organizing property of certain systems and distinguishes between

cohesive, selective, and active aspects.</p>


<p><b>Muhammad S. El Naschie</b> discusses in his

contribution on <i>Dimensional Symmetry Breaking, Information and the arrow of Time in

Cantorian Space</i> the exact expectation value for the dimensionality of a Cantorian

space-time as well its standard deviation and its connections to time symmetry breaking. </p>


<p><b>Norbert Fenzl</b> presents <i>A Consideration of

Interaction and Exchange of Information between Open and Self-organizing Systems</i> in

which he introduces the concept of a so-called field of interaction. This is a field in

which the interactions between self-organizing systems and their environments take place,

and are essential to sustaining the systems. </p>


<p><b>Peter Fleissner and Wolfgang Hofkirchner</b> attempt <i>An

extension of the concept of causality towards phenomena of information</i> in which they

postulate, in contrast to Newton's famous dictum, <i>Actio non est reactio</i>. They prove

mechanistic thinking unable to deal with information phenomena and opt for an approach

that allows for including causal relations which are characteristic of self-organization

processes and cannot be viewed by classical physics.</p>


<p><b>Josef Wallmannsberger</b> focuses <i>On limits</i>,

that is on barriers such as membranes in living systems. From this point of view language

is a complex bio-socio-cultural membrane. All in all, Wallmannsberger proposes to transfer

linguistic and semiotic methods of manufacturing knowledge to the realm of information

science in order to proceed <i>Towards a Prototheory of Inform(ul)ation</i>.</p>

<a name="self-organizing"></a><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></p>


<p>The third section,<b> Self-organizing Systems</b>, deals

with the most fundamental features of information processing systems which are covered

mainly in terms of physics. </p>


<p><b>Eric J. Chaisson</b> sketches <i>The Rise of

Information in an Evolutionary Universe</i>. He outlines the grand scenario of cosmic

evolution and points out that it is the contrasting temporal behaviour of various free

energy flux densities that have given rise to conditions which are needed for the

emergence of ever-higher forms of complex systems including intelligent human life forms

on earth. </p>


<p><b>Stanley N. Salthe</b> returns to the second law of

thermodynamics, when he goes into <i>The Overall Pattern of the Evolution of Information

in Dissipative, Material Systems</i> and to the so-called second law of infodynamics he

has formulated elsewhere. He argues that in investigating information, an internalist

stance has to be taken, and distinguishes three phases of system development: immaturity,

maturity and senescence. </p>


<p><b>Werner Ebeling</b> treats the correlation of <i>Entropy,

Information and Predictability of Evolutionary Systems</i>. He investigates several

entropy concepts and studies the relation between entropy and information. He comes to the

conclusion that evolution shows several &quot;phase transitions&quot; from bound to free

information, that is from information which is connected with a definite material

structure, to information which is connected with meaning and goals and which originates

in the beginnings of life. </p>


<p><b>Katalin Martinás</b> inquires into <i>Entropy and

Information</i> and shows that the embodied information in the material can be measured in

terms of entropy. She introduces a new measure, &quot;extropy&quot;, which is closely

related to &quot;exergy&quot;, and which takes the whole assembly of the system in

question, together with its environment, into account. </p>


<p><b>Yukio-Pegio Gunji</b> presents a model for a system

consisting of elements which detect the measurement apparatus of other elements. Using

this model, which satisfies the so-called internal measurement assumption, he elaborates

on the problem of origin which implies an instant of time that makes us distinguish a

prior from a posterior event. The title of his contribution is: <i>Degeneracy of the Local

Structure Renormalizing Infinite Time and Space</i>.</p>


<p><b>Gerhard Grössing</b> interprets quantum phenomena in

a realistic sense insofar as they represent hermeneutic circles between

&quot;objects&quot; and their experimental boundary conditions. Postulating likewise

circles for all higher-level organizations (from molecules to living systems etc.) he is

able to view <i>Quantum Information in an Evolutionary Perspective</i>.</p>


<p><b>Karl Svozil</b> starts from the statement that in

quantum mechanics there are observables which cannot be measured simultaneously with

arbitrary accuracy. In his contribution <i>Information and the Complementarity Game</i> he

develops models of computational complementarity which simulate this problem. </p>


<p><b>Frank Schweitzer</b> draws a distinction between <i>Structural

and Functional Information</i> in order to include syntactic and semantic aspects which

are neglected by the notion of potential information related to statistical entropy. He

develops <i>An Evolutionary Approach of Pragmatic Information</i> which is generated by an

interplay of structural and functional information. In a model of artificial agents he

discovers analogies to the creation of a collective memory.</p>

<p>The fourth section,<b> Life and Consciousness</b>, tries

to continue the considerations made in the section before without overlooking the sharp

differences between inert material systems and living systems including mind. This varies

from author to author. </p>


<p><b>Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski</b> paraphrases Norbert Wiener

when he addresses the mind-body problem and writes: <i>Information - neither Matter nor

Mind</i>, but the link inbetween them. In his remarks <i>On the Essence and the

Evolutionary Stage Concept of Information</i> he explains the generation of information as

a multi-stage process of (in-)forming, meaning and evaluation, a process which cannot be

reduced to either the form or the content or the effect of information.</p>


<p><b>Abir U. Igamberdiev</b> looks upon <i>Information

Processing as an Intrinsic Property of Biological Systems</i>. <i>Origin and Dynamics of

Information</i> are identified in the recognition activity of biomacromolecules.

Hypercyclic structures are formed on which the self-reproduction of systems is based.</p>


<p><b>Efim Liberman and Svetlana V. Minina</b> put forth

their quantum molecular computer hypothesis and discuss the problem of external observer

versus inner viewpoint. According to this idea, the brain is a network of neurons that

work as molecular computers which realize information processing on an intracellular

level. The idea of a <i>Cell Molecular Quantum Computer and Principles of New Science</i>

are related by some suggestions to describe living creatures and the physical world from

the same view.</p>


<p><b>Claudio Z. Mammana</b>, who gives a brief sketch of <i>The

Natural History of Information Processors</i>, underlines that this should be based on a

more generalized theory of evolution. According to him, information processors which

(firstly) can take different configurations, (secondly) transfer configurations through

time (memory) or through space (communication), and (thirdly) produce new configurations,

can be found in living beings, but not outside the biosphere.</p>


<p><b>Allan Combs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sally Goerner</b> build

on the theses of Eric J. Chaisson and Robert Swenson. <i>The Evolution of Consciousness as

a Self-organizing Information System in the Society of Other Such Systems</i> is seen in

the context of energy-driven evolution in which energy and information can be viewed as

two sides of the same coin. They assume an analogy between the metabolism of a living cell

on the one hand, and consciousness on the other, which is made up of a similar complex of

interactions. </p>


<p><b>Pedro C. Marijuán</b> makes clear that <i>From the

Specialization of Multicellular Colonies to the Functioning of the Vertebrate Brain</i>

there is, so to speak, but one step. Both <i>The Topological Inventions of Life</i>,

namely the cellular signalling system and the nervous system (the first concerning the

relations between cells, and the second concerning the relations between the organism and

the environment) represent &quot;infostructures&quot; that have evolved in accordance with

the demands of the surroundings. He views the &quot;Bit&quot; as a substitute for the

&quot;Joule&quot; and goes into the cerebral principles of minimization, which will form

fundamentals in the emerging information science.</p>


<p><b>Ernest Lawrence Rossi</b>, starting from the insight

that with psychology (since it deals with self-organizing entities) one is entering the

area of non-linear dynamics, tries to introduce the so-called logistic equation that is

used to describe population dynamics into psychology. That is what he calls <i>The

Feigenbaum Scenario in a Unified Science of Life and Mind</i>. He underpins this with

empirical evidence that the numbers 7 and 15 are found as numbers of units which play an

important part in sensing, cognition and human behaviour.</p>


<p><b>William Dockens III</b> bases his considerations on

Eigen and Winkler&#146;s life/death game. He argues that a pattern of reasoning, called

Alpha-H, which is unable to cooperate and to deal constructively with change and

diversity, threatens our societies with extinction, because the evolution of our technical

societies has made the alternatives to cooperation potentially lethal. Thus he predicts <i>The

Demotion of Alpha-Homo sapiens</i>, for other mindscapes will serve our kind of

civilization better.</p>

<p>The fifth section, <b>Society and Technology</b>, is

devoted to finding common features of (and differences in) information processing systems

on the cultural level of evolution, and systems on prehuman levels. Due to the nature of

subject, it cannot avoid touching on practical consequences, from the design of

information systems to the need for qualifications to ethical and political implications. </p>


<p><b>Michael Conrad</b>, in a keynote speech at the

conference on <i>Organisms, Machines, and Societies: from the Vertical Structure of

Adaptability to the Management of Information</i>, deals with the proper relationship

between human society and the new information technology. He defines adaptability as the

capacity of a system to continue to function in an uncertain or unknown environment. As he

does not ascribe self-organizing dynamics to computers, he comes to formulate a tradeoff

principle between programmability, efficiency and adaptability. This principle may serve

as a tool for foreseeing positive or negative consequences for human life.</p>


<p><b>Roberto R. Kampfner</b> goes into <i>Function Support

as an Information Systems Development Paradigm</i>. If the adaptability of organizations

shall be furthered by information systems, then the development of information systems

must consider the organizational function they support. </p>


<p><b>Robert Artigiani</b> starts from the point that

information is a measure and should not be reified, nor should agency be attributed to it.

He explores the interrelationship of <i>Interaction, Information and Meaning </i>against

the background of the self-organization approach and clarifies the role of values, ethics

and morals in societal life.</p>


<p><b>Susantha Goonatilake</b> discerns three lineages of

information: the genetic, the cultural and the &quot;artifactual&quot;. He assumes the

increasing merger of these lineages, brought forth by advances in biotechnology and

information technology. This will have a great impact on <i>The Structure of

&quot;Communities&quot; and Communications in the New Millenium</i>.</p>


<p><b>Gottfried Stockinger</b> puts the accent on <i>The

Role of Variety in the Evolution of Information Society</i>. In exploring similarities

between genetic mechanisms in living systems and social transformation processes, he

points out that &quot;errors&quot; in the reproduction of the dominant social code are

crucial for the creation of change and hence for reaching a stable path of societal

development on a new level. </p>


<p><b>Nina Degele</b> modifies the widely held idea that <i>Knowledge

in the Information Society</i> is the decisive factor for economic growth and

technological advance. According to her, the great looming question is which knowledge

people need to behave competently, effectively and successfully in a world full of

computers. She speaks of &#132;media-competence&quot; and media-competent experts. </p>


<p><b>Klaus Fuchs-Kittowski and Peter Krüger</b> compare <i>The

Noosphere Vision of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Vladimir I. Vernadsky in the

Perspective of Information and of World-wide Communication</i>. The notion of noosphere

means a sphere of mind and work which is a layer superimposed on the biosphere. Both great

natural scientists and thinkers shared the opinion that what we call today globalization

by means of information and communication techniques will support the emergence of the

noosphere. Noogenesis, however, should not be reduced to a mere technological trend.</p>


<p><b>Ralph H. Abraham</b>, author of the famous Web

Empowerment Book, looks upon the explosive growth of the World Wide Web as the

neurogenesis phase in the embryogenesis of a new planetary civilization. He is working on

strategies for <i>Measuring the Complexity of the World Wide Web</i> and the visualization

of it what he calls <i>Webometry</i>.</p>


<p><b>Tom Stonier</b> ends the list of contributions by

defining parallels between the impact of the printing press and the impact of computerized

telecommunication networks. These networks, he states, approach the anatomy of the human

brain, thus building up a global brain. Collective intelligence will be enhanced, though

not all properties of <i>The Emerging Global Brain</i> can be anticipated yet.

Nevertheless the emergence of this seems to be as significant a process as was the

emergence of life itself. </p>
