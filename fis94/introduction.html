<h4><b>Presentation</b></h4>


<p>The final decades of our century have witnessed stunning

changes in the sciences, in technologies, and in societies at large: politics, economy,

culture. Perhaps there is only one term capable of summarizing the new traits so

distinctive of our time: <i>information</i>. Computers, molecular biology, and

telecommunications, prime movers of the present world, are all of them penetrated by

information --in their history, in their surrounding conceptualizations, and in their

inner details. Indeed an <i>information era</i> has taken over an ostensible <i>atomic or

space era</i>. Governments, international institutions and multinational companies are

working now at delineating what they call the <i>information society</i>.</p>


<p>But, what is information? At least from the scientific

point of view, information appears as a vague and incoherent item. Information belongs to

that (not so rare) category of scientific terms which, after their successful coinage,

suffer so much abuse and overextension that a factual abandonment of research ensues, no

matter the apparent brilliancy or social acceptance. In the case of information, the

scientific excitement generated during the 40's and 50's --the formative years of

information theory, cybernetics, systems theory, etc.-- has steadfastly receded with every

passing decade and presently has almost disappeared, except for some very particular

applications.</p>


<p>The Madrid Conference has been an attempt to rescue

information as a central scientific tool and to put it into a new context so as to serve

as a basis for a fundamental disciplinary development. The novelty of the conference was

that, instead of trying a precise 'atomic' definition of information, and actually getting

quagmired in it, information was understood as related to a widespread network of

processes potentially involving the integration of cosmic (subatomic), molecular, cellular

(neuronal), computational, human and social occurrences, demanding both a <i>unifying</i>

and a <i>multiperspectivistic</i> approach. So to speak, instead of the discussion of a

single particularized concept, information becomes the intellectual adventure of

developing a 'vertical' science connecting the different scales of 'informational

processes' --reminding physics itself, which from a pre-Galilean particularized term

evolved towards a vertical science connecting the previously separated

&quot;celestial&quot;, &quot;sublunar&quot;, and &quot;terrestrial&quot; occurrences.</p>


<p>The contributions to these Proceedings will clarify the

above too sketchy ideas. In the introductory sections that follow, some general

reflections have been added concerning the nature of the concept (the 'science'), the

relationship it has with the other disciplines, and the intimate liaison it maintains with

life.</p>

<p><a name="information: a slippery term"><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></a></p>


<h4>Information: a slippery term</h4>


<p>Originally, information was a minor, specialized

scholastic (Latin) term --&quot;informatio&quot;-- meaning the act of giving or changing

the <i>form</i> of a particular piece of matter; it implied, however, a very sophisticated

double process back and forth between act and potence. From scholastics the concept jumped

to natural philosophy and cultivated language, and later to the emerging scientific

disciplines. It is in the 20th century when the concept reaches its peak: information

makes a triumphal massive entrance in the postwar period, with cybernetics, systems

theory, the so called information theory, game theory, control theory, the development of

computers, the birth of artificial intelligence, the new linguistics, the neguentropy

discussions, the chase for DNA, etc. Indeed an atmosphere of tremendous optimism was

generated in relation with the concept. In 1941, in a letter to von Neumann, R. Ortway

captures the mood of the times when he writes:</p>


<p><cite>&quot;these days everybody is talking about

organization and totality. Today´s computing machines, automatic telephone switchboards,

high-voltage equipment, such as the cascade transformer, radio transmitter and receiver

equipment, and also industrial plants or office are technical examples of such

organizations. I think there is a common element in all of these organizations which can

be the basis for an axiomatization.&quot; (Nagy et al., 1989, p. 188)</cite></p>


<p>Information, clearly was the answer. In 1948, N. Wiener,

the founding father of cybernetics, was definitive: <cite>&quot;Information is

information, not matter or energy. &quot;</cite> (p. 132). <cite>&quot;The role of

information and the technique of measuring and transmitting information constitute a whole

discipline for the engineer, for the physiologist, and for the sociologist.&quot;</cite>

(Wiener, 1948, p. vii)</p>


<p>But perhaps the time was too short, and the theories and

disciplines contained too many gaps. Somehow, the concept became confusingly entangled in

too many places. Looking in retrospect it is easy to appreciate a process of conceptual

degradation and loss of confidence --the hegemony won by the <i>sciences of the artificial</i>

(Simon, 1969) during this time was not alien to that. Progressively, in spite of its

tremendous potential, information was felt by the new generations of scientists coming to

these interdisciplinary fields more as a source of misunderstanding and paradoxes than as

a source of enlightenment. A recent comment (1989) on information theory by E. Wigner

illustrates the prevalent change of mood:</p>


<p><cite>&quot;The present information theory is entirely

uncharacteristic. And I think it would be time to change it. But I have a very hard time

with it. I have not succeeded. Perhaps I should not have mentioned it because it is not

good to admit that one tries to do something and is not able to do it.&quot; (p. 256)</cite></p>


<p>Certainly information has become &quot;Jack of all

trades&quot;. During these decades it has been entangled: 


<ul>

  <li>with the formulation of the second law and the concept of

    entropy (e.g., the discussions on Maxwell´s Demon); </li>

  <li>with the measurement process in quantum theory; </li>

  <li>of course with Shannon´s information theory; </li>

  <li>with non-equilibrium systems and non-linear dynamics; </li>

  <li>with cellular DNA and the enzymic processes; </li>

  <li>with the evolution of living beings and the status of

    Darwinism; </li>

  <li>with the measurement of ecological diversity; </li>

  <li>with the origins and evolution of nervous systems; </li>

  <li>with the functioning of the brain; </li>

  <li>with the nature of intelligence; </li>

  <li>with the representational paradigm of AI; </li>

  <li>with logic (logical depth, algorithmic complexity); </li>

  <li>with linguistics (meaning, semantics); </li>

  <li>with the very foundations of epistemology and ontology; </li>

  <li>obviously with &quot;electronics&quot; and the work of

    hardware and software engineers; </li>

  <li>with the mass-media and all the new communication

    technologies; </li>

  <li>with the theoretical claims of library science and

    documentation management; </li>

  <li>with the basic postulates of economy and the social

    sciences; </li>

  <li>with political philosophy...</li>

</ul>


<p>The use of the term information in all these provinces is

not incorrect, but its overall coherence has become minimal. It seems that every aspect of

human endeavor or biological behavior --or even of cosmic evolution-- contains and

processes information; but there is no glimpse yet as to how such overextended

acceptations can be consistently conceptualized.</p>


<p>The advancement in the solution of this puzzling concept,

entrenched into the foundations of numerous disciplines, may demand drastic changes in

view --perhaps including the reflection on what it actually means to establish a

'disciplinary' point of view. </p>

<p>

<a name="information science and the system of the sciences"><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></a><a name="a solution to the puzzle"> </a></p>


<h4>Information as a science: a solution to the puzzle?</h4>


<p>In relation to the above confusing panorama, some

considerations addressed by the Madrid conference seem pertinent. First of all, there is

the assessment that significant changes have happened in some of the above fields which

imply new possibilities in order to advance towards the consolidation of the concept (the

'science'): particularly in molecular biology, computer sciences, and the neurosciences;

and also in physics and the political sciences.</p>


<p>The historical parallel with the foundational period of

physics may be illustrative. During the scientific revolution of the 16th century the very

concept of physics was at stake --amidst a generalized ambiance of scientific and social

crisis during most of that century too. Intense debates were raging between the

Aristotelian-scholastic 'old guard' and the New Science followers: Erasmus, Luis Vives,

Thomas More, Petrus Ramus, Francis Bacon. A significant aspect of the discussion was about

the meaning of physics as something in itself, as the 'substance' underlying all nature.

As we know well, particularly after the Galilean and Newtonian developments (and of many

others: Leonardo da Vinci, Simon Stevin, Johannes Kepler, René Descartes), physics was to

become not just a <i>concept</i> but a splendid science comprising a host of interrelated

processes.</p>


<p>The suspicion about the concept of information is that

maybe something similar is happening. What we are naming under the label of information

might become in itself not a concept but an enormous network of interrelated multiscale

processes. What sort of processes? Following Conrad's insights (1983, 1984) on the

vertical 'flow' (cross-scale percolation) of interrelated information processes from the

subatomic realm to molecules, cells, organisms and ecosystems, we can envisage a parallel

'flow' of information comprising human societies too: from countries and socio-economic

systems at the top, to institutions and individuals, and then to nervous systems, and down

to the rest of the scale. How could the milestones of this information 'flow' between such

different 'societies' be delineated? Let us remark that the flow of energy from the solar

photons to every level of an ecosystem or of an organism was delineated not because of the

discussion of a single concept, but because a powerful scientific discipline, physics, was

successfully at work.</p>


<p>The intuitive notion of <i>absence</i> may provide

another strategic entrance into the intricacies of the informational 'societies'. Numerous

instances of informational change appear as temporary absences or gaps within a complex

dynamical intertwining of opposing processes --involving symmetry breaking and symmetry

restoration (Matsuno, 1985). Counteracting such transient gaps or &quot;functional

absences&quot; (symmetry breakings) within the nested life-cycles of the

biologico-informational entities, from molecules to cells, organisms, and societies,

generally implies a cascade of upwards and downwards processes. The functional absences or

voids seem to acquire a state of flux: moving up and down, horizontally and vertically,

fanning-in and fanning-out within every social level; encountering the appropriate

counteracting mechanisms or not, and being temporarily solved or not (Marijuán, 1995).</p>


<p>Formally, the structural reorganizations stemming from

the <i>solution</i> of these functional absences at different levels could be related to

the entropy concept (or to Schrödinger's negative entropy). The biological solutions

generally imply synthesis (production) and the subsequent necessity of structural

(metabolic) inputs from the environment. However, because of the current conceptualization

of entropy, this crucial property of living beings, the metabolic openness, implies a

complicated 'inverted' reasoning (Stonier, 1990; Swenson and Turvey, 1991). The genuine

(non-metabolic) information processes endowed with negligible energy --e.g., cellular

signaling systems, nervous systems-- make things far worse... Overall, the

interrelationship between information, symmetry, entropy, and uncertainty is far from

being properly established. At the end it might imply quantum physics reappraisal (Conrad,

1989; Rosen, 1991; Matsuno, 1993).</p>


<p>This line of consideration finally leads to the profound

relationship existing between the terms <i>information and society</i>. It can be argued

that the existence of societies is dependent on the generation, exchange, and processing

of meaningful information amongst their constituent members. So to speak, inanimate matter

survives passively, just following the standard physico-chemical laws; but biological and

para-biological societies need be involved in a permanent web of self-modifications and

problem-solving activities in order to achieve their survival. The life-cycles of the

component individuals appear both as <i>problems</i> and problem-solving <i>engines</i>,

becoming the sources and sinks for the information exchanges (providing them with

'meaning'). This socioinformational way of existence can be pinpointed in the cell,

&quot;society of enzymes&quot;, in the organism, &quot;society of cells&quot; (or

highlighting the role of the nervous system: &quot;society of neurons&quot;), and within

the &quot;society of individuals&quot;.</p>


<p>Thus, the search upon the nature and dynamics of

information would require focusing on the three above fundamental information-based

'societies' (keeping in mind the underlying 'society of vacuum' and the 'society of

nations' at both extremes of the spectrum, and the case of ecosystems having a mixed

condition). However, none of these societies provides a complete view on information. Each

one provides a unique set of clues on the nature and dynamics of information; but none of

these societies alone, no solitary discipline, seems capable of solving the conundrum of

processes surrounding the concept --they have to advance together.</p>


<p>The development of a <i>vertical</i> information science,

both with a unifying and a multiperspectivistic penchant, may represent a gradual outcome

to the puzzle. At the same time it implies addressing the unfrequently discussed issue of

the &quot;disciplinary specialization&quot; and the subsequent &quot;integrative

problem&quot; of the sciences (or in other words, the actual problem-solving dynamics of

the system of specialized disciplines). As a matter of fact the development of the new

science represents a challenge to go beyond the traditional methods and division of work

within scientific communities. As the Madrid conference put it, we badly need to delineate

a &quot;common house&quot;, an interdisciplinary umbrella where the cross-fertilization of

such diverse insights might take place in a new type of multidisciplinary environment. </p>

<a name="information science and the system of the sciences"><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></a> </p>


<h4>Information science and the system of the sciences</h4>


<p>Traditional discussions on disciplines are centered on

reductionism, holism, unification of science, and the like. However, what constitutes a

discipline is seldom discussed (what does following a discipline imply?, what is the

origin of the term?, why do we have many separate disciplines?, how do they relate each

other--do they work independently or as a system?). The discussion on information forces a

reconsideration of both the classical issues and these seldom formulated questions.</p>


<p><a name="backfigure1">The &quot;territorial&quot; view of

disciplines, with the related idea of fields and subfields of specialization, constitutes

a widespread intuitive notion. The logical-positivist emphasis on reduction between

adjacent fields has added the concept of hierarchy and established an order of disciplines

parallel to the corresponding 'material levels' of reality (</a><strong><a href="fis94intro.html#figure1">Figure 1</a></strong>).</p>


<p>The pinnacle corresponds to physics. This simplified

arrangement has been endorsed by logical-positivist authors, systems theorists, and

post-positivist authors (explicit quotations from Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding

or from Karl Popper can be pointed out--see Marijuán, 1994; Küppers, 1990). </p>


<p><a name="backfigure2">A rather different picture can be

drawn, however, allowing for the superposition or overlapping of disciplines. Then, two

complementary aspects become highlighted: that basic disciplines <cite>overlap</cite>

their territories --and in these overlappings new disciplines are born-- and that real

knowledge of any material aggregate forces us to apply a plurality of disciplinary

approaches and to <cite>integrate them</cite> (</a><strong><a href="fis94intro.html#figure2">Figure 2</a></strong>).</p>


<p><a name="backfigure3">The overlapping or combinatory

dynamics at work among the sciences can be easily observed in the new diagram. Almost

every successive vertical overlapping of Figure 2 makes sense and corresponds to an

existing subdiscipline: chemical physics [physical chemistry], <cite>biophysics,

psychophysics; sociophysics; biochemistry, psychochemistry</cite> [neurochemistry], <cite>sociochemistry</cite>

[toxicology, environmental chemistry]; <cite>biopsychology, biosociology</cite>

[sociobiology]; psychosociology (</a><strong><a href="fis94intro.html#figure3">Figure 3</a></strong>).

An integrative dynamics can be observed too. A spattering of 'object oriented' integrative

disciplines emerges in the horizontal dimension of the diagram: <cite>engineering

disciplines (nuclear, chemical, mechanical, etc.), physiology (ecology), medicine

(anthropology), political philosophy</cite> (<strong><a href="fis94intro.html#figure3">Figure

3</a></strong>). These multidisciplinary sciences correspond to the plurality of

approaches necessary for understanding their respective objects, now taking into account

the whole material, industrial, biological, cultural, and social interrelationships in

which these objects are immersed. Again, some of these multidisciplinary sciences can be

applied outside their own horizontal strata, generating new subdisciplines, e.g.: <cite>bioengineering,

socioengineering, ecosociology</cite>, etc.</p>


<p><a name="backfigure4">The idea of information science

dovetails into this enlarged picture. As a putative vertical science it creates its own

spattering of subdisciplines in the overlapping with the other existing sciences: <cite>information

physics, information chemistry</cite> [molecular computing], bioinformation [artificial

life], <cite>informational neuroscience</cite> [artificial intelligence], and

socioinformation (</a><strong><a href="fis94intro.html#figure4">Figure 4</a></strong>).

Information physics has recently been vindicated as a new discipline (Stonier, 1990;

Haefner, 1992). The recent interdisciplinary attempts of molecular computing and

artificial life might be associated, like artificial intelligence, to the overlappings of

a unitary information science widely conceived too. In this regard, and without discussing

their particular contents, information science promotes an elegant alignment of these

recent interdisciplinary explorations and suggests a unifying sense for the whole of them.

Finally, socioinformation might be an adequate label for the pioneer insights of McLuhan

(1964) and for some contemporary elaborations on political sciences (e.g., De Vree, 1991).</p>


<p>In addition, information science may open a new line of

reasoning on the integrative dynamics of the sciences and the overlapping phenomenon

itself. Disciplines are no fields by any means, rather they correspond to restricted

perspectives which the scientific communities have historically elaborated searching upon

partial aspects of reality. Like the specialized sensory modalities of nervous systems,

disciplines provide reliable partial information about the external world, but in order to

cope with the (non-restricted) real-world problems they need <cite>integration</cite> (and

overlapping) with the extra information provided by the other disciplines / sensory

modalities. The sciences appear, then, as a social cognizing system: both in the sense of

a plurality of specialized disciplines which are continuously mixing and rearranging their

contents for the sake of the problems they have to solve, and also as being the result of

communities of dedicated scientists in a continuous interaction. The realization of this

sociointegrative dynamics, in the double interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary

dimension, becomes the central problem in the praxis of science (the reductionist problem

only characterizes a very narrow aspect), as witnessed by the continuous necessity of

meetings, means of communication, interdisciplinary flows, creation of new specialties,

etc. The scientific method appears from this point of view as the conditions to be met for

a coherent decomposition of problems by communities of problem solvers whose workings are

separated in time and space (as witnessed by the citation structure itself).</p>


<p>Although the sciences have become the most sophisticated

social sensorium, with problem-solving characteristics at the highest abstraction level,

and have increased --particularly at the successive scientific revolutions-- the range and

scope of their institutional presence and problem-solving activities, their overall

dynamics remains obscure and largely within the realm of pragmatics. Historically, every

emerging science has brought new philosophical and interdisciplinary views on the working

of the other sciences. Information science, as the science of &quot;problem solving&quot;,

could bring new insights on the poorly understood facets of social and scientific

problem-solving.</p>

<p>

<a name="information and life"><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></a> </p>


<h4>Information and life</h4>


<p>Under the guiding principles of the <i>sciences of the

artificial</i> (Simon, 1969) information had a predominant anthropocentric nature: it was

conceived as an inmaterial component accompanying man-made artifacts. From that point of

view, an &quot;information science&quot; was founded in the early 60´s. It was the result

of two conferences held at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1961 and 1962.</p>


<p>Dominated by pragmatic goals for more efficient systems

for organizing and storing (scientific) information, that early information science had a

particular mandate to search for the &quot;grand, unifying relationships of human and

human-machine communication&quot;. It was defined as derived from, and related to,

mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the

graphic arts, communications, library science, and other fields --in its own style having

a remarkable interdisciplinary breath. Nevertheless, in a decade or so, computer sciences

and artificial intelligence departments engulfed the incipient information science

communities. Not many authors kept alive the interdisciplinary attempt (Brookes, 1974;

Scarrot, 1986).</p>


<p>Now, 35 years later, the sciences of the artificial are

in retreat, perhaps including its latest companions: chaos science and the sciences of

complexity (Horgan, 1995). And as the Madrid conference put it, there is now the pervading

sensation that it is from the inner working of life, from the dynamics of biological

information, that we should contemplate the anthropocentric realm --particularly the

sciences-- and not the other way around. Actually, from life and information the

foundations of all the other natural sciences can be reached out; we have already

mentioned the reappraisal of quantum physics (Conrad, 1989; Rosen, 1991; Matsuno, 1993).</p>


<p>The new foundational attempt at the Madrid conference has

put the emphasis on the intimate relationship between life and information --at every

level. It is a truism that the &quot;problems&quot; of countries are solved by

institutions, companies, and individuals; that the problems of individuals are solved by

the neurons of their nervous systems; and that the neuronal problems are solved by their

populations of active molecules (enzymes, proteins, receptors, channels). Every instance

of life, social, organismic, cellular, has its own resources --including the sciences

themselves in the case of modern societies-- in order to detect, counteract, and solve its

existential problems, passing them, up and down, or horizontally, to others dimensions of

life. How problems in one realm can be coherently broken down in order to be solved by

underlying populations of specialized 'microscopic' agents constitutes a genuine

algorithmic feat, but it turns out to be trivial for the agency of life.</p>


<p>Our present system of the sciences has not considered

these informational processes in their entirety. They have been cut into separate

disciplines that barely understand each other at their borders. The internal continuity of

life's problem-solving realms has consequently disappeared, and information has been

disposed of. But the neglect of information does not mean that it stops its incessant

percolation: only that our scientific and social understanding of its working has been

impoverished.</p>


<p>Two generations ago, some critical philosophers had

anticipated these conceptual troubles. Whitehead (1925) called attention to the lack of

vision and superficial thought in the increasingly professionalized scientific

communities. Ortega y Gasset´s essay on the &quot;barbarianism of specialization&quot; in

the 30´s was a brilliant but unattended warning about the future consequences of the then

emerging process of narrow specialization. Overspecialization and professionalization are

the core of the scientific enterprise today. It is a fact that the present system of the

sciences has contributed exceedingly to technological development, but it has become a

crippled instrument for the solution of our highest level problems: political, economic,

ecological, international ones. The sort of problems where information flows reach their

highest complexity.</p>


<p>We live in an era of dramatic changes --brought about by

the sciences themselves. Directives about the <i>information society</i> are not enough to

advance towards the solution of the many interrelated contemporary crises. We need a well

balanced system of the sciences in order to illuminate our global use of knowledge and to

improve our social and international problem-solving.</p>


<p>Centuries ago, it was Erasmus, Vives, Ramus, More, who

felt in their time the necessity of new science. Like them, we need new science now.

Perhaps the refoundation of information science will contribute to opening the system of

the sciences in new required directions.</p>

<p><h4>Fundamental concepts in quantum physics, computer

sciences, physics and chemistry</h4> </p>


<p><b>Michael Conrad</b> opens the First Part with a

provocative statement: that the unmanifest properties of the vacuum percolate through the

whole cascade of informational processes, up to the living cell or to the intelligent

observer (Schrödinger's cat included). <b>Koichiro Matsuno</b> refers to the problem of

quantum-inconsistency: information (and unidirectional time) may emerge from the quantum

formalisms once inconsistency is acknowleged in the internal measurement process; then

biological information follows naturally. <b>George Kampis</b> deals with the limitations

of formal (computing) systems, discussing the validity of the Church-Turing thesis and

postulating a chemically motivated &quot;self-modifying&quot; type of processing. <b>Yukio

P. Gunji et al.</b> focus on biological computation, language games, and non-von Neumann

systems, emphasizing the aspects related to measurement. Finally, <b>Tom Stonier</b>

discusses troublesome aspects in the relationship between information and entropy (say,

one of the many prices that physics has to pay for neglecting information as a fundamental

property of the universe). </p>

<p><h4>Living cells and their molecular components (&quot;society of enzymes&quot;)</h4> </p>


<p>In the Second Part, <b>Ramón Margalef</b> recapitulates

the relationship between the living and the non-living organization, including the role of

information &quot;trails&quot; in the overall structure and dynamics of ecosystems. <b>George

R. Welch</b> introduces the topic of enzymes: their quantum, mechanical, catalytic and

biochemical properties represent the 'rockbottom' of life (these are the first information

processing devices really equipped to deal with the 'real world' problems, and not just

with simplified 'computer world' problems). <b>Ray Paton</b> discusses the

interdisciplinary and epistemological relationships between cellular processing and the

related computer models (both biology and computer sciences are eagerly benefitting from

such symbiotic relationships). <b>Pedro C. Marijuán</b> traces the &quot;absence

phenomenon&quot; back to its biochemical and molecular biological roots: protein

degradation (is a cell made up of 'eternal' proteins environmentally viable?), cell

specialization, cell death, and multicellular problem-solving. <b>Efim A. Liberman</b> and

<b>S.V. Minina</b> retake the enzyme topic from an unusual perspective: that the exquisite

quantum &quot;computing&quot; properties we observe in enzymes are a necessary

precondition for intelligent life; the so called 'anthropic principle' becomes a sort of

'enzymatic principle' here.</p>

<p><h4>Neurons, nervous systems and organisms (&quot;society

of neurons&quot;)</h4> </p>


<p>The Third Part starts with <b>Péter Érdi</b>'s approach

to brain structure and function, from a monistic (hermeneutic) perspective reconciling the

&quot;device approach&quot; and the &quot;philosophical approach&quot;. But <b>Peter

Århem</b>'s view is dualistic (in his standpoint the intrinsic randomness of molecular

channels and receptors becomes a central argument). Then <b>Ernest L. Rossi</b> discusses

the behavioral and psychobiological aspects of brain function, including the potential

healing repercussions of the 'abstract' neuronal problem-solving (e.g., neuropeptides,

neurophysiological rythms). <b>Deborah Conrad</b>'s contribution analyzes the phenomenon

of consciousness and subjective experience, and how the physical brain can build

&quot;meaning&quot;. The final contribution of this part, by <b>Otto E. Rossler</b>, is a

synthesis of physical, biological, neuroscientific, and philosophical ideas. His

developments on &quot;endophysics&quot; elegantly interconnect scientific with ethical and

esthetic aspects.</p>

<a name="information and the organization"><b><hr size="1" align="left" width="25%"></b></a></p>


<p><h4>Information and the organization of social systems (&quot;society of individuals&quot;)</h4> </p>


<p>The Fourth Part starts with <b>Johan K. De Vree</b>'s

analysis of the basic categories of socio-political systems: order, information,

structure, stability... Then <b>Fernando Rodrigues-Carvalho</b> and <b>John Dockery</b>

speculate on what does constitute a system 'property' (they elaborate on previous work

dealing with 'social entropy'). Two contributors retake the subject of information from a

general standpoint, <b>James Barham</b>, <b>Peter Fleissner</b> &amp; <b>Wolfang

Hofkirchner</b>, their particular emphasis being on non-linearity, information and

epistemology; and the development of a unifying information theory in relation with

evolving-self-organizing systems. <b>Robert Agelink</b> and <b>Nanneke van der Heijden</b>

apply the concept of information to the processes of 'steering and regulation' in social

systems. Finally, <b>John Dockery</b> discusses an 'improper' topic: the relationship

between information processing and warfare. Incidentally, this topic generated

controversy. It is obvious that some branches of science and engineering (e.g., physics,

artificial intelligence) have greatly enhanced the capabilities of weaponry and &quot;war

technology&quot; --and have received generous public support because of that. It may sound

naive, but the promise of the new information science is to enhance the intellectual and

moral tools for &quot;peace technology&quot;. The search for harmonious ways of

problem-solving, socially and at the international sphere, will be a substantial part of

the information science programme.</p>
