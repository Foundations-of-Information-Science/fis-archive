<h4>George Rickey Welch</h4>

  <li><b>The enzymatic basis of information processing in the

    living cell</b> <p>G. Rickey Welch, Department of

    Biology, University of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148, USA</p>

    <p>Analogies are drawn between the computational aspects of

    information processing and the enzymatic events of cellular metabolism. The origin thereof

    is linked to the logic-elements involved in the reaction-diffusion processes of the

    metabolic operation. It is shown how such function entails a 'molecular machine' quality

    when associated with organized non-equilibrium energy sources in the cell.</p>

<h4>Ray Paton</h4>


<ul>

  <li><b>Metaphors, models and bioinformation</b> <p>Ray Paton, The Liverpool Biocomputation Group, Department of

    Computer Science, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, UK</p>

    <p>The notion of bioinformation is central to the

    biosciences. This short paper examines a number of metaphors which are intimately related

    to this idea. These include metaphors about 'system' as well as metaphors associated with

    biosystem as 'text'. A framework is presented which allows ideas about biosystems and

    computer systems to be displaced and a number of specific topics are then discussed.

    Firstly, information processing in non-neural tissues is given as an example of parallel

    distributed processing. This is followed with a number of metaphors associated with

    'text', including 'glue', 'verbs' and 'interpretation'. The paper concludes with a

    proposal on how to integrate general ideas of bioinformation using the idea of the

    'ecology of domains'.</p>

  <li><b>'Gloom in the society of enzymes': on the nature of

    biological information</b><p>Pedro C. Marijuán,

    Departamento Ingenieria Electrica y Electronica, C.P.S. Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza

    50015, Spain</p>

    <p>Most approaches to information pay attention only to the

    'positive' or constructive side ('presences') of this phenomenon: its composition,

    construction rules, emergence, effective activity, etc. However, the 'negative' or

    degrading aspects ('absences', disappearance of activity) are equally important within

    most biologico-informational processes. In fact, protein degradation can be put on a par

    with protein synthesis concerning its functionality and sophistication. By taking into

    account recent integrative discoveries in the molecular biology of the cell (signalling

    system, cell cycle, apoptosis, protein degradation, enzyme function) a wider approach

    encompassing both the 'presence' and 'absence' aspects seems possible. The overall

    dynamics which emerges -- involving symmetry breaking and symmetry restoration by means of

    information processing mechanisms -- may be extrapolated to neuronal and socio-economic

    realms too. Interestingly, the phenomenon of 'absence' can also be pinpointed, at least as

    a metaphor, within the internal structure of natural numbers.</p>

    is based on four principles: minimal price of action, optimum prediction, minimal

    <p>We take the occasion of the workshop to examine a

    proposition that systems may be better defined in terms of interactions based on

    information exchange rather than on atomic elements. Although speculative, the paper is in

    the spirit of exploration within a workshop atmosphere. It is enough for us that the

    interactions be perceived to exist. On this basis, components become interactors, which

    signal each other through the exchange of information mediated by some interaction

    mechanism. At a minimum, interactions need only be imputed. Consequences for the

    appropriate definition of a system parameter based on our position are examined. Possible

    mathematical avenues are introduced. In the process, a connection with belief systems is

    explored.</p>

<h4>James Barham</h4>


<ul>

  <li><b>A dynamical model of the meaning of information</b> <p>James Barham, 404 St. Joseph St., #2, Lancaster, PA 17603, USA</p>

    <p>The main challenge for information science is to

    naturalize the semantic content of information. This can only be achieved in the context

    of a naturalized teleology (by 'teleology' is meant the coherence and the coordination of

    the physical forces which constitute the living state). Neither semiotics nor cybernetics

    are capable of performing this task, but non-equilibrium thermodynamics and non-linear

    dynamics may be. A physical theory of the meaning of information is sketched, first by

    identifying biofunctions with generalized non-linear oscillators and their associated

    phase- space attractors, and then by postulating the existence, within all such

    oscillators, of a component capable of coordinating low-energy interactions with the

    correct environmental conditions supporting the dynamical stability of the oscillator. The

    meaning of information is thus interpreted as the prediction of successful functional

    action.</p>

<h4>Tom Stonier</h4>


<ul>

  <li><b>Information as a basic property of the universe</b> <p>Tom Stonier*, Professor Emeritus, Science and Society, University

    of Bradford, UK</p>

    <p>information to be a basic property of the universe the

    way matter and energy are. Operationally -- just as energy is defined in terms of its

    capacity to perform work -- so is information defined in terms of its capacity to organize

    a system. Pure energy can perform no 'useful' (entropy reducing) work without a

    concomitant input of information. Conversely, all expenditures of energy lead to a

    reorganization of the universe, hence to a change in its information status. Energy and

    information are interconvertible; physicists have been able to ignore the information

    parameter principally for two major reasons. First, historically, just as there was no

    need to define energy prior to the advent of increasingly complex, powered machinery and

    cannons (Galileo was a military engineer), so was there no need until the 20th Century to

    define information. It was the telephone engineers who first preoccupied themselves with

    developing a theory of information. The second reason is that physicists invented

    accounting devices such as <i>potential energy</i> and <i>entropy</i> to explain the

    apparent disappearance of energy yet maintain the law of the conservation of energy. The

    proposed theory would consider that what is conserved is the <i>sum</i> of information and

    energy. The mathematical relationship between information and entropy is provided by the

    equation: <i>I = (I0)e(-S/k)</i> while the conversion of energy into information involves

    the relationship: <i>1 J/K=10e23 bits</i> (approximately) Acceptance of the theory would

    require paradigm shifts in a number of interrelated areas.</p>

<h4>Ramon Margalef</h4>


<ul>

  <li><b>Information and uncertainty in living systems, a view

    from ecology</b> <p>Ramon Margalef, University of

    Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain</p>

    <p>The organization of living entities combines, in close

    proximity and partial overlap, dissipative and self-organizing systems. Their

    superposition, in which gradients of opposite signification cross, allows local

    discontinuities to occur, and in them a place for marginal chaos and fractal

    configurations. Among other features, a difference in turnover speed characterizes such

    coupling, higher on the relatively more uniform domain where entropy increases more

    easily, and lower at the more minutely organized places of preferential information

    accretion. At the level of elementary physical events, logical aspects of indeterminacy

    could perhaps be clarified by an observer, assuming that the living system performs the

    role of a witness of historical progress.</p>

    Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202, USA</p>

    <p>Biological systems are treated as percolation networks in

    which processes at all scales participate. Macroscopic inputs are transduced to

    microphysical events through an interleaved hierarchy of structures and processes and

    microphysical events are amplified to control macroscopic structures and functions.

    Integrity and adaptation are achieved through self-consistency dynamics operating at all

    levels of organization. The unmanifest structure of the vacuum plays a vital role in these

    dynamics.</p>

  <li><b>Internalist stance and the physics of information</b> <p>Koichiro Matsuno, Department of BioEngineering, Nagaoka University

    of Technology, Nagaoka 940-21, Japan</p>

    <p>Information is by itself intrinsically diachronic,

    whereas synchronic information conceived by referring to an invariant source matrix of

    information is no more than a theoretical artifact constructed in the limit of ignoring

    the historicity. Information is the basic attribute of local dynamics of internal

    measurement, in which any dynamics is taken to proceed through detection internal to

    interacting material participants of whatever kind. Information dynamics of a local

    character is semantic by virtue of constructing the global principle of conservation of

    energy from the inside. Material embodiment of information actualizes in the form of

    energy consumers acting toward the outside from their inside. Global dynamics such as

    mechanics is simply a phenomenon emerging from information dynamics.</p>

    <p>Biologically motivated computing presents us with a

    measurement process in science. It triggers an epistemological shift from state-oriented

    physics to measurement-oriented physics, in which we can find a parallelism with

    Wittgenstein's shift from rule following to a language game. We argue here that an

    approximation or computing process can be viewed as a language game and propose an idea of

    proto-computing which is metaphorically formalized through disequilibration between tree-

    and loop-program, as a model for measurement-oriented computing.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Self-modifying systems: a model for the constructive

    origin of information</b> <p>George Kampis,

    Department of History and Philosophy of Science, Eotvos University, Budapest, Hungary</p>

    <p>The mechanisms of information processing in Turing

    machines and biological systems are examined from the point of view of physical sets of

    variables. Computation is characterized as a process, the realization of which involves a

    bounded set of interactions and a pre-definable set of variables in real systems. Using

    ideas from process philosophy, the ability of natural systems to transcend these

    computational modes is discussed. A class of systems, called self- modifying systems, that

    utilize persistent shifts in their defining interactions and variable composition is

    introduced. Various other ideas that lead to similarly non-computational or

    semi-computational scenarios (as in the case of distributed code systems) are referenced.

    As applications, computer models of emergent phenomena using randomly growing interaction

    sets as well as theoretical issues that range from the meaning of simulation to the

    problem of information gain in self-modifying systems are discussed.</p>

    <p>The concept of information seems applicable to

    into the possibilities as well as the limitations of processes of 'steering and

    promising in the understanding and explanation of the global dynamics of these social

    Tübingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 8, 72076 Tübingen, F.R.G.</p>

    <p>Ultraperspective is the capability of human beings to

    step into the shoes of another person. Endophysics is the science of those physical

    properties of the world which exist not from the outside but only from the inside. Both

    have in common the adoption of an &quot;exterior&quot; position. In the one case, the

    exteriority is &quot;horizontal&quot;, in the other, &quot;vertical&quot;.

    Ultraperspective is a macroscopic concept, endophysics a microscopic one. Both can be set

    up in either domain: animals acquiring the status of human persons, and objective features

    of the physical world acquiring the status of an observer-specific mirage. Mead and

    Lavinas, and Einstein and Bohr, are the protagonists. In the age of computer-assisted

    enlightenment, a new look at the ethical roots of science appears justified.</p>

    Netherlands</p>

    <p>This brief essay explores some of the subtler

    ramifications of the notion <i>order</i> or <i>information</i>. It starts out by arguing

    that and why a system's information or order must be one of the central determinants of

    ist power and productivity, hence of ist capacity to survive. Furthermore, such

    information must also underlie a system's <i>stability</i> and <i>adaptability</i>. And

    this again leads us to what may well be one of the main laws or non-linear relationships

    underlying the growth of information or order; an increase in a system's information or

    order is more likely according as ist <i>initial</i> level of order is already higher.</p>

    <p>The current information revolution in molecular biology

    has important implications for a new understanding of the phenomenology of mind, memory

    and behavior as a complex, self-organizing field of information transduction. This paper

    traces the pathways of information transduction in life processes from the

    molecular-genetic level to the dynamics of mind and behavior together with suggestions for

    future research exploring the psychobiology of mindbody communication and ist implications

    for the psychotherapeutic arts of the future.</p>

  <li><b>Vertical information flow in the brain: On neuronal

    micro events and consciousness</b> <p>Peter Århem,

    The Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology, Karolinska Institute, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden</p>

    <p>The consciousness problem and ist relation to theories of

    spontaneous brain activity are discussed. It is argued that an evolutionary perspective

    suggests an interactionistic solution of the consciousness problem, i.e., mental events

    interact with physical brain events. A specification of the physical events assumend to be

    associated with mental events is proposed to make the discussion of mind-brain theories

    more fruitful.</p>

    <p>An interactionistic solution of the consciousness problem

    requires random spontaneous brain activity. A mechanism for such activity is proposed on

    the basis of experimental findings. Some new results from patch-clamp experiments on

    intact neuronal tissue (the hippocamal slice preparation) are presented. The results

    indicate that single channel events may cause random sponaneous neuronal activity,

    illustrating the phenomenon of micro events including macro or global brain events, and

    also the central theme of vertical information flow. The findings highlight the importance

    of understanding the stochastic nature of channel gating</p>

    49, Hungary</p>

    <p>An attempt has been made to reconcile the &quot;device

    approach&quot; and the &quot;philosophical approach&quot; to the brain. Systems exhibiting

    high structural and dynamic complexity may be candidates of being hermeneutic devices. The

    human brain, which is a structurally and dynamically complex device, not only perceives

    but also creates new reality: it is a hermeneutic device.</p>
