  <li><strong>Possible relations between the semiotic and the
    informational paradigms of cognition and communication </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a way beyond the conflict between the
mechanistic-logical and the phenomenological-semiotic view of science and cognition? <br>
The mechanistic approach to science looks for universal laws and logical structures
uniting physicochemical nature, the living, cognition, intelligence, and society. But it
has created a big divide around the problem of semantics and signification in
bio-socio-cultural systems. On the one side, phenomenological and linguistic views have
tended to ignore the biological nature of the observer and communicator, seeing the
problem of meaning only as socially and individually constructed. While on the other side,
the classical approach to information science, derived from information theory and
computer sciences, has seen the problem of meaning under the light of
&quot;representation&quot; and &quot;syntax&quot;, merely attempting an extension of the
mechanistic world view into the socio-cultural realm.<br>
Is there a possible non-reductionist unification of the two views from some kind of new
Foundations of Information Science? Or do we have to live with the full blown version of
both paradigms - paninformation and pansemi-otic paradigm - in a sort of complementarity
philosophy (N. Bohr)? <br>
The present talk offers at transdisciplinary unifying framework called Cybersemiotics
working from a pragmatic platform of second order cybernetics, autopoiesis theory,
Luhmann's socio-communication, Wittgenstein's Language game theory, Lakoff and Johnson's
cognitive semantics and experientalism and C.S. Peirce's semiotics.</p>

<p ALIGN="left">Merging the concepts of emergence and
information by using a theory of evo-lutionary systems based on self-organisation, a
Unified Theory of Information (UTI) seems feasible. Such a theory can identify, on the one
hand, common aspects in the types of systems considered (dissipative, autopoietic and
social ones). On the other hand, it can deal with aspects of information that are special
to each of these system-types. In social systems individual values, norms, conclusions,
rules, ideas, experiences and believes can be seen as individual information. In the
process of constitution and differentiation of individual in-formation the signs, data,
knowledge and individual wisdom can be identified. On the basis of signals data is
gathered (perceiving). This data is the starting point for gaining knowledge
(interpreting) which is necessary for acquiring wisdom (evaluation). The semiotic triad of
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects of signs can be mapped to these three levels of
individual information. Norms, values, rules and laws that are con-stituted in the course
of social rela-tionships are seen as social information. Social information that is
consti-tuted and differ-entiated by interactions of all concerned actors of a social
system is termed a &quot;social collectivity&quot; if furthermore each involved individual
has the same chance and resources to influence and shape the emerging information
structure. Social information that is constituted and differen-tiated by interactions of
individuals forming a subsystem of the system to which the emerging structures are applied
or by interactions of individuals belonging to the environment of the latter system is
termed a &quot;social totality&quot;. Social collectivities and social totali-ties reflect
symmetric and asymmetric distributions of power in social systems. A basis for a wise
society - which could tackle the global problems - would be the collective formation of
social information and the ability and possibility of individuals to choose and
differentiate their individual information in a wise and self-determined manner. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A biologically-consistent diffuse semiotic
    architecture for survivalist information-processing </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The adoption of diffuse rationality creates a practical
bridge between (bio)semiotics and information-processing in formulating real-world
local-to-global self-con-sistent criteria for the emergence of life and consciousness.<br>
We suggest a computational architecture consistent with evolutionary hierarchical
emergence, which may serve as a framework for implementing survival-oriented
information-processing in real environments. We present an evolution-ary model of the
relationship between autonomy and dependence across scales, and describe the implications
of its alternating complex-rational-complex nature for computational process-closure,
enclosure and exposure.<br>
A query-reflection architecture can model the intermediate region between diffuse and
formal rationalities in a manner which is consistent with the abductive emergence of
animate and inanimate entities. &quot;Requests&quot; for reaction to external stimuli are
formulated as queries propagating across a varyingly dimensionally confined computational
structure. Multiple sequentially accessible model planes perform as &quot;reflective&quot;
metastatic representations of the temporal or scalar hier-archies characteristic of
biological evolution and structure, and the systematic process closure required for
functional autonomy is provided by the consequent multiple communicative inter-planar
reflections. The queries and reflections can be represented either as the interactions of
propagating waves with the model-layers, or as the transfer of packets of information
between active centres which &quot;sum&quot; information before re-emitting it. In the
limit of the difference between successive model planes tending to zero the two
formulations are equivalent, and may be described by a single pseudo-one-dimensional
equation.<br>
Very simplistically, we can imagine the complete structure as two cross-cou-pled
counter-propagating feed-forward neural networks, where each pro-vides the weighting
required for operation of the other through local information-pro-cessing model-planes
which are equivalent to feed-back neural nets. This interpretation corresponds closely to
a proposed &quot;physical&quot; representation of Peircean semiosis.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Signs, information and interaction of open systems
    </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Open systems are obliged to interact with a certain part
of their relevant environment to sustain and reproduce own structural self-organization
through the process of input and output (metabolism) of energy and matter. The metabolic
activity based on the system specific structural organization, the Structural Information,
produces signs (changes, transformations, differences, etc.) in this part of the
environment, which we call Field of Interaction. <br>
The totality of all these signs produced by the system itself as well as these produced by
the influences of co-systems, we call Potential Information. <br>
Interaction of open systems is only possible if there is some overlapping of fields of
interaction to es-tablish a channel, a common &quot;pool of signs&quot;. Metabolic
activities obliges the systems to exchange material and/or energy with the channel and so
far to im-port signs - elements of structural organization patterns - from co-systems. If
the imported &quot;alien&quot; signs are compatible (&quot;readable&quot;) with the
receiving structural organization, a system will be able to react macroscopically and
produce pragmatic information, the basic condition for interaction. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information systems and intercourse in
    scientifical society </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>According to Robert Merton's research work, the
significance of the scientific society for the development of science, and of production
in general, is now broadly acknowledged. The process of informatization of society has
essentially changed not only the system of relationships between the participants of the
sci-entific society itself, but also the system of transmission of ideas beyond the limits
of the scientific society. It is particularly the character of scientific communication
which has changed. All this compels to evaluate the nature of scientific discourse(s) in a
new way. Today it is obvious that even the content of scientific conceptions depends on
the nature of scientific communications, and thus to a large extent on the development of
our information systems. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A synergetic approach to the construction (design)
    of a unified conception of information </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Synergetics which regularly is defined as
interdisciplinary study of self-organisation processes in systems (or structures and
media), in the more general (broad) sense may be understood as a metamodel of human
(interpersonal) communication. The synergetic approach suggests that human communication
is a nonlinear, circular process which may be described with the help of syn-ergetic
parameters of order. It gives possibility to integrate the set of various types of
communications into a unified context of general gestalt consideration and to better
understand the interplay between arbitrary, convenient, chance (random) and necessary
aspects in processes of semiodynamics, in semiogenesis as synergetic pro-cesses in their
essence. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information und die Wirksamkeit des Geistes </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Komplexe Systeme&quot; sind Funktionskörper des
Zusammenspiels materieller und geistiger Prozesse nach dem Muster: Geist - Prozeß - Geist
= Veränderung einer Informationsbedeutung (Technik als Epiphänomen des Systems) oder:
Prozeß - Geist - Prozeß = Veränderung der Systemstruktur. Die Hirnforschung anerkennt
das Geistige als ein notwendiges und untrennbares Epiphänomen; die Informatik als
Technikwissenschaft trennt das Phänomen Technik (= reines technisches Funktionssystem)
vom Phänomen Geist (= reines zweckorientiertes Nutzungssystem). Die Theorie komplexer
Systeme ist nur der Platzhalter für eine noch fehlende Theorie der Gleichberechti-gung
von Kodierung und Bedeu-tung beim Verständnis der Information. <br>
Information ist eigentlich die Wirkung von Bedeutungen auf Bedeutungen, was wir in der
Regel als einen geistigen Prozeß verstehen. Adäquat darstellbar soll aber dieser
geistige Prozeß auch als ein hochkomplexes technisches Funk-tionssystem sein, in dem die
Bedeutung durch Kodierung, durch materielle Zei-chen, repräsen-tiert werden. Diese
Hypothese hat zu einer unwahrscheinlich erfolgreichen Technikentwicklung geführt,
gleichzeitig aber auch den Weg zum Verständnis des Geistigen verbaut.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information, self-organisation and evolution -
    Information neither matter nor mind, but a link between matter and mind by coding </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The variety of conceptions of the term
&quot;information&quot; in different scientific disci-plines shows the need for &quot;The
quest for a unified theory of informa-tion&quot; to understand the essence of the
information phenomena. A unified theory of information must allow detailed understanding
of information genera-tion, processing and use in nature, technical systems, human beings
and society, to provide a link to the terminology of the discipline under discussion. <br>
Today, it becomes increasingly clear that different conceptions based on each other have
developed for understanding of information. (1) the structural; (2) the functional; (3)
the evolutionary understanding of information. The last position aims at achieving a new
understanding of information through a the-ory of complex, evolutionary systems and a
specific understanding of information as triad: of form (syntax), of content (semantic)
and effect (pragmatic). We will try to explain the generation of information as a
multi-stage process of (in-)forming, meaning and evaluation, a process that cannot be
reduced to either the form, the content, or the effect of information. This will be
demon-strated on different levels of complex systems. It was first seen by semiotics. As
is well-known, semi-otic has since long called for the semantic and pragmatic as-pects of
information to be taken into account as well (see Morris 1960). But since these aspects
cannot be represented in terms of bits - and the computer is merely a bit-processing
machine - they are often simply disregarded. Therefore it is important, that semiotics
studies signs and the processes in which they are involved and recognises that in complex
systems these processes give rise to meanings, that must be regarded as central to the
emergence of information.<br>
We need an understanding of information which does not comprehend in-forma-tion as a given
structure. For that, the concept of self-organisation has its justifi-cation here, because
information is indeed generated for the first time during this process. We have to see the
difference between the deterministic world of formalised systems, the processes of
syntactic information processing and the processes of information emergence in high
complex, evolving systems, the creativity of Nature and Man. </p>
