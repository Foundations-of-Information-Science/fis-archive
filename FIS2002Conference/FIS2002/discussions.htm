        <p>Dear FISers,<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Pedro Marijuan asked me to serve a chair in this FIS 2002
        e-conference.<br>
        (The preamble of the FIS 2002 and all of the technical deails are found
        at<br>
        &nbsp;<a href="default.htm">http://www.mdpi.net/fis2002/</a>&nbsp;
        ) Although I don't know exactly what the<br>
        role should be, I took liberty of saying something on a couple of papers
        as<br>
        a kickoff, and would like to see what would follow, of course, from both<br>
        sides of the pros and the cons.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I initially picked up three papers by John Collier, Andrei
        Igamberdiev<br>
        and Pedro Marijuan because of some familiarity of the subject matter to
        me.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What I could get from John Collier's is in short &quot;One
        step backwards to<br>
        be &nbsp;followed, hopefully, by two steps forwards&quot;. I am pretty
        sure that many<br>
        of us would now feel sick and tired about the issue of information
        because<br>
        the language to be employed for elucidating what information is all
        about is<br>
        already information-laden. One attempt at coping with the inevitable<br>
        complication associated with information which John took up is to make
        an<br>
        appeal to an expression of information, instead of its literal
        representation.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; John took so-called the internalist stance for expressing
        information<br>
        with recourse to the contrast between the possible and the actual. If
        one<br>
        takes the externalist position claiming that there is nothing new under
        the<br>
        sun, the burden of specifying what information is should solely be upon
        the<br>
        shoulder of the innocent company who is destined to receive it. Instead,
        the<br>
        possible which John focused anticipates serious negotiation between the<br>
        concerned parties, each of which has a very good reason vindicating its<br>
        own local position. John's physical information is about a sort of
        enigma<br>
        that looks actual towards the past, but possible towards the future. The<br>
        actual part of information is about the negotiation already settled, and
        the<br>
        possible part is about the current agenda on the table yet to be
        negotiated.<br>
        The absence of the global arbiter might be a serious drawback to some<br>
        one, but the very absence can furnish us with an open-end opportunity
        for<br>
        information-in-itself.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As sharing almost the similar view, Pedro Marijuan came up
        with<br>
        revitalizing the idea of the invisible hand. If one looks at the
        miraculous<br>
        accomplishment that all of the concerned parties have jointly achieved
        so<br>
        far, it would seem as if guided by the invisible hand even in the
        absence of<br>
        the external arbiter. This is of course an anthropocentric metaphor in
        the<br>
        best sense of the word. The point in focus is, however, that a simple<br>
        bookkeeping between supplier and consumer is the sole means for
        tailoring<br>
        such an exquisite and unbelievable invisible hand. Adam Smith must have<br>
        anticipated what the 21st century would be going to accomplish in the
        name<br>
        of information.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Andrei Igamberdiev faced, in a head-on manner, the material
        underpinning<br>
        of the bookkeeping between supplier and consumer. Material transaction
        is<br>
        the business of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly enough, Andrei turned
        the<br>
        standard practice of quantum mechanics totally upside down. Andrei's<br>
        internal quantum state is the one that can remain stable or robust as<br>
        against measurements proceeding internally. Although the standard
        quantum<br>
        mechanics has told us that the quantum wavefunction is extremely fragile<br>
        against the operation called measurement (e.g., a Schroedinger's cat),
        it<br>
        must also be quantum mechanics which is responsible for securing the<br>
        stability of our every-day material world. If quantum mechanics cannot
        meet<br>
        this challenge, our life would simply turn out to be a bad joke. Andrei
        has<br>
        set the agenda that internal quantum state must be about a necessary<br>
        infrastructure upholding the material world informationally.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Information at the turn of the 21st century seems to be a
        thread<br>
        connecting physics, chemistry, biology and even economics. A common<br>
        denominator is serious negotiation between supplier and consumer.<br>
