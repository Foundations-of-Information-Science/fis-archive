<p>
Dear Fis,
<br />
<p>this is a very great discussion. It does touch on a common underlying
<br />
principle of belonging-together, being-understandable, well, consilient.
<br />
This very deep emotion (which may be hard-wired, such is its basic nature)
<br />
will probably forever elude grasping by intellectual(cortical) tools, as it
<br />
is an underlying axiom, on which we base our system of thoughts.
<br />
(Wittgenstein: the axioms UNDER our sentences cannot be described by our
<br />
sentences.)
<br />
The other aspect of the discussion, interdisciplinarity and the need for a
<br />
common perspective, language, system of references, itches me to make a
<br />
point on. There is a common system of references behind all phaenomena of
<br />
natural science: namely their material property. I may sound Marxist by
<br />
sticking to the principle of material first, ideology is a sequel hereto. If
<br />
it is a subject of material science, then it is material. There is no
<br />
natural science of immaterial things.
<br />
A rather brutal and barbaric way of finding something common in very diverse
<br />
contexts is by referring to the meterial side of the concepts. If it is
<br />
material, then it can be counted. I propose to the FIS community the
<br />
ideology of an engaged accountant, very restricted in his views, only the
<br />
numbers talk. No details, please, only the numbers. A Marxist natural
<br />
philosophy would rejoice on finding a way of consolidating observations in
<br />
diverse fields by finding that their numeric pictures allow handling them in
<br />
common ways.
<br />
Now the argument would come, that the numbering (and therefore, the
<br />
measuring) system does not allow for a common way of picturing the
<br />
phaenomena, because their numeric pictures do not throw similar shadows unto
<br />
each other, so that they cannot be translated into each other.
<br />
Let me please repeat that this interjection is wrong. The numbering system
<br />
is flexible enough to privide a transportable background on which we can
<br />
calculate and predict the effects of a position change of a genome in the
<br />
same classical fashion as we are able to calculate and predict the
<br />
occurrence of the next eclipse of the Moon in Central Europe. One has only
<br />
to understand the tricks the numbering system plays when describing
<br />
diversity, similarity, probability and size. The size attribute of an
<br />
interdependent, autoregulated system is of a secondary importance. It
<br />
appears that the more diverse the parts of an assembly are, the more &quot;inner
<br />
tension&quot; (maybe, energy) is there. The size itself is not the important
<br />
attribute when discussing the inner diversity of subsets of a set. (In
<br />
actual fact, there is - to top it off - a super little trick concerning
<br />
size: if one categorises sets according to their inner diversity, there are
<br />
two virtually equivalent sizes.)
<br />
We have the cultural tradition that if mathematics is about anything then it
<br />
is about size, extent, measure and that these are the things that are
<br />
stable. If not even a mathematical count on the number of objects of a set
<br />
and the count on their similarities and the count on their dissimilarities
<br />
can remain stable, but rather make an unclosed loop like an Escher
<br />
staircase, then one has no solid axioms under one's system of thoughts.
<br />
Obviously, genetics is understandable. We can use it, what we lack is a
<br />
theory to explain what we observe and do. The key attribute of this theory
<br />
is that it looks at logical attributes distinguishing parts of a whole and
<br />
disregards the size congruence. We have to capture the obvious feeling:
<br />
&quot;this is the same just bigger / smaller&quot; in order to begin understanding
<br />
phaenomena which appear to belong to different sciences. We have to come to
<br />
terms about what we do as we recognise two things that are the same (but
<br />
bigger or smaller) before we can attack the task of describing what we do as
<br />
we compare two things that are different in order to find similarities among
<br />
them. So, diversity is, in my eyes, the subject we should discuss, rather
<br />
than the similarity which consilience describes.

Betreff: Re: [Fis] consilience of limited observers
<br />
<p>Dear Malcolm and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Sorry for going backwards in the discussion (I have moved in to a new
<br />
institute in this univ., see my new address at the bottom). After two
<br />
weeks, I have this response pending:
<br />
<p>At 18:09 18/10/2004, Malcolm wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;So, you don't think that the use of common tools, such as logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;statistics, etc., or even common concepts (such as Aleks's example of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;intereactive information) are enough to forge a genuine inter-disciplinary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;consilience? In what way would a *genuine* informational approach be
</em><br />
different?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<p>Those common tools do not help to connect --but very superficially-- the
<br />
different disciplines involved in the analysis of any moderately complex
<br />
phenomenon. We do not have  'logical cues' intradisciplinary situated
<br />
informing the practitioner that his/her favorite discipline becomes
<br />
irrelevant to understand the phenomenon, and that a new perspective has to
<br />
enter. Like medieval rhetors we have to &quot;weigh&quot; the heterogeneous
<br />
conceptual paths and compose an ad hoc disciplinary mix. I dare to call
<br />
&quot;informational&quot; to this artistic blending or switching between separate
<br />
knowledges because this type of compositional work is archetypal in other
<br />
info &quot;model systems&quot; too (fis old story), such as in cellular signaling
<br />
systems' pathways, and in nervous systems' separate sensory modalities.
<br />
Switching to a new discipline and/or creating a new interdisciplinary field
<br />
is like our own attentional switching: we continuously change the focus and
<br />
put a new modality or a new sensory patch into the job of scanning little
<br />
bits of the world.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;There is a distinction made in philosophy of science between the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;dynamics of science, which excludes socio-psychological factors, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;external dynamics, which looks only at the social dynamics of scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;communities.  This seems to be similar to the distinction that Pedro is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;making.  If so, his claim is that interdisciplinary consilience cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;captured within the internalist's way of viewing science (that is, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;terms of the bare relationship between theories and their evidence).  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;have some questions about this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;I think that anyone who studies science has to make some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;idealization or abstraction--science is too complex to understand in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;total. Some simplifications have to be made when studying any complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;phenomenon. Clearly that does not imply that the particular idealizations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;made by the internalists or the externalists are the right ones, or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;best ones, to make for the purpose of understanding some particular aspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;of science, such as interdisciplinary consilience.  So, I am very open to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Pedro's line of thought.  On the other hand, there has to some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;simplification made.  How should this be done?
</em><br />
<p>I do not have a good response yet. My personal contention is that the
<br />
simplest 'info society', the living cell, has not received a sound info
<br />
analysis yet. Why the bionformaticians community, basically committed to
<br />
reductionist views, is making all that fuss on &quot;systems biology&quot; (and not
<br />
only them: eg, some biosemioticians too)? An intriguing piece of new
<br />
knowledge is needed.
<br />
<p>Concretely about the internal/external views of science, it might be that
<br />
what we need is the &quot;externalist&quot; of the internal, and the &quot;internalist&quot; of
<br />
the external. I mean, we can only build a social accumulation of knowledge
<br />
(of associative learning) by relying on the most crude and elementary, and
<br />
abstract elements within the action/perception cycle (eg, counting). And
<br />
viceversa, we universalize and objectivize upon that knowledge by socially
<br />
networking the limited, individual pieces produced... (references,
<br />
professional commmunities, etc.)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;This is a partial answer to my question: A general understanding of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;macroscopic order arises out of simple interactive micro-systems may point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;the way towards a better understanding of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;An example that I know more about arises in physics, where it is difficult
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;to explain why matter organizes itself into liquid, gas and solid phases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;when interacting molecules &quot;know&quot; nothing about the macroscopic order of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;which they are a part.  This phenomenon is hard to explain because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;critical phenomena (occurring during phase transitions) depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;correlations that act at all distances at the same time.  That is, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;usual idealization that density fluctuations are limited to micro-scales
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;does not work.  Rather, the fluctuations occur at all length scales (hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;the self-similarity of critical phenomena).  The mathematical techniques
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;applied to this problem (scaling, intermediate asymptotics, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;renormalization methods borrowed from quantum field theory) are still not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;very well understood from a mathematical point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;However, I still don't see exactly how this connects with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;interdisciplinary consilience in Pedro's sense.  This may be because I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;not sure exactly what interdisciplinary consilience amounts to on this
</em><br />
view.
<br />
<p>I tend to disagree on that micro/macro view. Perhaps it happens with some
<br />
cleanliness in phyiscial systems, that one can extensively track the
<br />
physical information movements around (those ups and downs in Stan's
<br />
scheme) notwithstanding phase transitions; but not in the biological realm.
<br />
There one finds strange entities with info &quot;black hole&quot; properties: living
<br />
cells advancing in their respective life cycles can disregard very robust
<br />
info items on a facultative basis, and produce new items. And they do so
<br />
monumentally independent of their whereabouts (up to some limits, of
<br />
course). How the inner and the outer 'command flows' may systematically
<br />
ignore each other, annihilate, reinforce, etc., (quite differently from the
<br />
obedient average of the physical) is a great question: systems biology (and
<br />
classical integrative physiology too), in need of a massive disciplinary
<br />
switching becasue that black holing game is played massively..
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;But why should it be considered seriously, exactly?  I don't (yet) see why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;the internalist view of science has this limitation.  For it abstracts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;away of the distinction between individual scientists and a group of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;scientists, so it could easily include emergent features that arise from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;the interactions between individuals.  If not, why not?
</em><br />
<p>&quot;Consilience&quot; is great because it conveys a bygone aspect of the sciences:
<br />
their conciliation, their permanent session in &quot;concilium&quot; ... (lost into
<br />
the hierarchy and reduction dusts, and merely left into the territory of
<br />
pragmatics); and also because it evokes the global wisdom or 'consilience
<br />
of closure' that we may legitimately demand to our social system of
<br />
creation of knowledge: that it should contribute to the advancement of life.
<br />
<p>(that's all I can ramble around the questions!)
<br />
<p>best greetings
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. to Rafael --Borges is indeed a treasure-- I remember his &quot;Funes el
<br />
memorioso&quot; too: isn't it a parable of the limitations of the observer? And
<br />
to Jerry: can you connect your molecular algebra (syntax) to the protein
<br />
folding problem? (I will try to read carefully all this recent stuff).
