<p>
Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>Greetings to the New Year.
<br />
Best Wishes to all for a stimulating and productive year.
<br />
<p>A very special Thank You to Pedro for his hard work and generous 
<br />
contributions in making this web conference an intellectually 
<br />
valuable exchange.
<br />
<p>In this message, I seek to bring out several critical points that 
<br />
deserve, from my point of view, further attention.
<br />
<p>As with most good discussions, FIS contributors offer a wide spectrum 
<br />
of personal, philosophical and scientific view points.  How can these 
<br />
individual strands be woven into the fabric of a theory of 
<br />
information?
<br />
<p>I choose to poise questions in four areas concerning a potential theory:
<br />
1. related basic concepts
<br />
2. roles of abstractions in transmission between systems
<br />
3. qualities of social transmissions
<br />
4. durability of informational concepts.
<br />
<p>For precedence, it is of critical importance to look at the theories 
<br />
of time, of force, of space, etc and ask:  to what extent can these 
<br />
individual theories be separated from natural language and how 
<br />
successful are these terms translated among disciplines?
<br />
<p>For example:
<br />
How is absolute Newtonian time related to biological time?
<br />
<p>How is the physical concept of force related to social or political force?
<br />
<p>How is a mathematical notion of &quot;space&quot; related to the concept of mental space?
<br />
<p>After one has seriously addressed these preceding questions, then one 
<br />
can ask:  What is a reasonable expectation for the concept of 
<br />
information?
<br />
<p>What are the common features of all forms of information?
<br />
One common feature is the possibility of transmission from one system 
<br />
to another.
<br />
Do any other common features encase the concept of information?
<br />
In particular, what is the role of encoding?
<br />
Is encoding an encasement of information?
<br />
If encoding is to be taken as an encasement of information,
<br />
then, what are the logical restrictions on the encoding?
<br />
Is encoding necessarily an abstraction?
<br />
If so, is intracellular communication an abstraction?
<br />
And, if intracellular communication IS AN ABSTRACTION,
<br />
what system is generating the abstraction?,
<br />
what is the nature of the transmission of the abstraction? and
<br />
what is the nature of the system that decodes the abstraction?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From a chemical perspective, one can view chemical metabolism and 
<br />
chemical genetics as chemical observables - experimental sciences. 
<br />
Are the chemical sciences an abstraction in the same sense that 
<br />
mathematics is an abstraction?
<br />
<p>If we contrast Shannon information with chemical information, how do 
<br />
we go about creating isomorphisms between the transmitting processes? 
<br />
What is the nature of the tensions of contrasting an abstraction 
<br />
(Shannon information) with a physical or chemical process?
<br />
<p>Social information, by its very nature, requires the participation of 
<br />
two or more individuals.  In turn, individual members of a society 
<br />
are socially and culturally unique - each with an individual 
<br />
trajectory.  Each individual trajectory is grounded in heritable 
<br />
derivations from parents and socially heritable habits from the 
<br />
encasing culture.  This suggests, when placed in the context of human 
<br />
will and human motivations, that social information places special 
<br />
requirements on both the encoding system that generates the 
<br />
transmission and the interpreter?  Is it necessary to encase the 
<br />
generative qualities of the individuals who contribute to the nature 
<br />
of the abstraction transmitted?  If so, how should these be 
<br />
abstracted?
<br />
Can we imagine an encasement of human qualities such that the pure 
<br />
logic of mathematical thought is sustained?  And transmitted?  And 
<br />
preserved for years? decades? centuries?
<br />
<p>This leads directly to the question of the durability of information.
<br />
Is information &quot;the same&quot; for all time and place?
<br />
Or, is information metastable?
<br />
More precisely:
<br />
Is the concept of information more stable than Newtonian laws?
<br />
Is the concept of information more stable than the genetic code?
<br />
Is the Shannon conceptualization of information the only possible 
<br />
basis of higher forms of information?
<br />
If additional forms of information are possible, will they be more or 
<br />
less stable than Shannon information?
<br />
What if additional forms of information can not be placed in the same 
<br />
mathematical encasement as the Shannon mathematics of information?
<br />
A priori, will the new forms of information be metastable with 
<br />
respect to Shannon's mathematics?
<br />
A priori, will the new forms of information be metastable with 
<br />
respect to the genetic code?
<br />
If a new form of information was created that exceeded the 
<br />
metastability of both Shannon information and genetic information, 
<br />
what would be its philosophical source?  Mathematics? Physics? 
<br />
Chemistry?  Biology? Philosophy? Religion?
<br />
<p><p>Happy New year to All!
<br />
