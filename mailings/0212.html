Dear Fisers,
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the basis of evolutionary and ecological thinking using selection
</em><br />
theory going into socio-communication on a basis of meaning we might be
<br />
able to do something. This is what some of Niklas Luhmann's work is about,
<br />
where he operates with biological, psychological and social systems
<br />
autopoiesis (may be it is better to talk of organisational closure as
<br />
Varela and Mingers suggests). Luhmann work with information and meaning as
<br />
two different concepts.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The part of his huge work I have read and understood I think there are
</em><br />
many valuable things, but also that his meaning concept is insufficiant
<br />
founded and that his understanding - at least  of Peirce's - semiotics is
<br />
not sufficient. So future work should try to integrate the progresses he
<br />
has made.
<br />
<p><p>Indeed, Luhmann«s approach turned out to be very fruitful. Although he died
<br />
some days ago at the age of 70, his work is continued by a lot of
<br />
&quot;disciples&quot;, and partly I am one of them.
<br />
As he tried to establish a general system theory using Weber, Parsons,
<br />
Habermas and also bio-approaches like autopoiesis, he tried to show that
<br />
all kind of creative or genetic structures show similar qualities:
<br />
redundancies and feed-back-loops, which  allow a return to prior stages of
<br />
evolution (he called it re-entry, term I think he took from Spencer-Brown)
<br />
to &quot;renew&quot; the gentic material under new circunstances.
<br />
On the sociological level this kind of re-entry - which besides enhances
<br />
variety - allows an important widening of the limits of structural
<br />
adaptability and of the range of internal system communication.
<br />
Following Luhmann, the significance of information emerges if an event
<br />
turns out to be selective, if it chooses out of several possible states of
<br />
a system. The ability to recognize differences has therefore to be a basic
<br />
quality of systems, linked to self-referencialitiy.
<br />
Such an observing or measuring system - and there is no doubt that social
<br />
systems are of that kind - works with a closed and circular structure which
<br />
decomposes immediatly if there is no constructive activity to delay
<br />
decomposition.
<br />
I made my own picture looking at the emergence o a new significance of
<br />
signs by exampling it with a card game, usually played by using sequences
<br />
of four different nipes. The significance of a certain card in the game in
<br />
relation to the other cards in the players hand changes: the As may be the
<br />
highest-value card, but if you expect a king to complete your poker, the As
<br />
dealed to you does not create the significant additional value. The same
<br />
may happen to the partners hands.
<br />
That means: there is an information value in the elements (events) itself,
<br />
an &quot;Eigenvalue&quot;, but it is only &quot;rescued&quot; when placed into an appropriate
<br />
sequence.
<br />
Time, like Pedro stated, enters the game. But more than the duration of
<br />
time in seconds or hours, what really matters is the factor
<br />
&quot;syncronicitiy&quot;. It determines if the moment of placement is or not
<br />
appropriate to &quot;make the difference&quot; in a given sequence. Syncronicity
<br />
means the coincidence of events in time, so that one &quot;fits&quot; to the other.
<br />
(e.g. the coincidence of 4 kings at the same time in the players hand)
<br />
Luhmann uses &quot;coincidence&quot; as an important part of information-reality.
<br />
There has not to exist any link of causality to establish information: just
<br />
two events which apear simultaneously or in a predictable way to be
<br />
reffered one to each other are enough.
<br />
Like in the following example: &quot;When the neighbour enters his garage, I
<br />
usually begin to cook&quot;. The causality in this case is purely informational.
<br />
He knows, it is 11.30h a.m., time to prepare the meal. In short his wife
<br />
will come home from work.
<br />
Some signals have start character. A sequence of events may be allocated in
<br />
its functional role. So it may represent a whole sequence. When it appears
<br />
(when the neigbour enters the garage), the sequence &quot;working day lunch&quot; is
<br />
called and executed.
<br />
The variety of cultural codes (VEMs) is controlled and limited by social
<br />
conditioning, based on the tradition of the past. Does this not &quot;work&quot; any
<br />
more, then social transformation processes, inpredictable in its
<br />
realization, take over. This affects  the process of sequencing cultural
<br />
codes, that means the education system in the large sense of the term.
<br />
<p>To continue the bio-soc parallels: Sequencing in molecular biology means
<br />
composition of an information-code which refers to cells in an organism.
<br />
Sequencing in cultural sociology means composition of an information-code
<br />
which refers to events in an organisation. Cells, like events, die and are
<br />
substituted by others, similars, but different. Different events mean a
<br />
different sequence in elementary information codes, which may express a
<br />
social transformation as a change of (usual) behaviour.
<br />
Different from the meaning of the code himself (determined by previous
<br />
recording), the meaning of the (accidental) change is not determined
<br />
previously: there are usually many alternatives of changed behaviour before
<br />
one of them is executed.
<br />
This variety creates a higher degree of liberty of choice. There is just
<br />
one condition: the appearence of the emerging information-sequence has to
<br />
be different from the previous. Establishing this difference, the new
<br />
fenomena may be functional within a &quot;division of labour&quot; in a defined
<br />
network.
<br />
<p>I know this is a rather functionlist approach subject to severe
<br />
epstemological claims. But as it works in everyday life, it deals with
<br />
reality, and that &quot;fits&quot;.
<br />
