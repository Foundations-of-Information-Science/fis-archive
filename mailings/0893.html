<p>
Relatively few days ago, it happened again the end of another year, 
<br />
as it has been determined conventionally and even compulsively by 
<br />
those cultural assumptions that caused the emergence and evolvement 
<br />
of the Western civilization. At present it is the only CIVILIZED 
<br />
environment on Earth that prevails. All the other different cultures 
<br />
have in practice disappeared under the homogenizing pressure - pardon 
<br />
I should have written progress - of the Western Civilization. The 
<br />
values of this civilization are not dogmatically maintained as it has 
<br />
happened in the domain of several other quite conservative cultures. 
<br />
The Western civilization is always changing in accordance with new 
<br />
perspectives conceived by very creative decision-makers.
<br />
<p>In the 1990's three main events caused some radical changes in the 
<br />
dynamics of this superb civilisation:
<br />
<p>1. The failure of the government of the Soviet Union to maintain in 
<br />
operation its colonizing procedures, which during more than six 
<br />
decades had masked the original socialist principles, which aimed at 
<br />
improving the perspective of every worker and his/her family. 
<br />
Instead, along these decades the soviet policies intended and 
<br />
succeeded in making more and more homogeneous the performance of 
<br />
masses of people. Once again it was successfully organized another 
<br />
Megamachine (Mumford) for increasing the effectiveness, efficiency 
<br />
and productivity of the industrial production. What for?
<br />
<p>Evidently the Soviet government assumed that in this way its 
<br />
decisions would be more competitive when being confronted to the 
<br />
interests and possibilities of other colonial powers.
<br />
<p>2.	In 1992, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was the U.N 
<br />
Conference on Environment and Development attended by 117 heads of 
<br />
state who examined some main aspects of the negative impact of the 
<br />
magnificent technological innovations which have aimed at maintaining 
<br />
the civilizing trends. The participants adopted the so called Agenda 
<br />
21 a blueprint for action that calls for improving the quality of 
<br />
life on Earth by using natural resources more efficiently, protecting 
<br />
global commons, better managing human settlements and reducing 
<br />
pollutants and chemical waste.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Summit was the culmination of several previous warnings 
<br />
such as: the «Silent Spring» of Rachel Carson in 1962 about the 
<br />
threat of toxic chemicals; the U.N. Biosphere Conference discussing 
<br />
global environmental problems in 1968; the «Limits to Growth» 
<br />
published by the Club of Rome in 1972; the discovery of a «hole» in 
<br />
the Earth's ozone layer in 1985,...  Many other results were 
<br />
generated by intelligent but narrow minded and short-sighted decision 
<br />
making as it was unaware that the human presence on Earth is 
<br />
restricted by limited terrestrial possibilities.
<br />
<p>3.	The continuous technological development supported by further 
<br />
advances of scientific research that has aimed at increasing more and 
<br />
more the speed in transport, telecommunications and data processing. 
<br />
This development has been determined by splendid and unbelievable 
<br />
achievements that have been attained by means of scientific research 
<br />
employed for increasing ad infinitum the technological innovation in 
<br />
these three domains. Two of the main outcomes of this human work have 
<br />
caused the emergence of ICT (Information and Communication 
<br />
Technology) and Automation, which are the causes of the increasing 
<br />
decerebralization of humans and the growing unemployment of workers
<br />
<p>These three events have contributed to create fabulously idealised 
<br />
circumstances that gradually motivated decision-makers of colonising 
<br />
entities located in rich and poor countries to conceive and design 
<br />
ultra modernised technological and methodological alternatives, those 
<br />
that pretend to make sustainable the UNSUSTAINABLE trends of the 
<br />
WESTERN CIVILIZATION. These are tendencies that have been always 
<br />
determined by decision making that aims exclusively at assuring the 
<br />
utilitarianism of those terrestrial possibilities that may increase 
<br />
the monetary profits and the financial benefits for every clever 
<br />
elite involved. These are decisions made whatever might be the 
<br />
consequences for the masses of people, as they are no more than human 
<br />
resources and potential buyers and consumers of everything that might 
<br />
be produced. The utilitarian principles developed all along the 
<br />
civilizing adventure may possible to involve some of them when it is 
<br />
necessary and only occasionally to recognize some of their needs.
<br />
<p>Anyhow, the features of the Western civilisation are in fact a 
<br />
culmination of the dynamics of the whole civilizing adventure, which 
<br />
briefly can be defined with the following few words &quot;everything must 
<br />
change in order to change nothing.&quot; In other words this expression 
<br />
means to change continuously the procedures in order to maintain 
<br />
unchangeable the exploitation of natural and human resources.
<br />
<p>This alternative has been also conceived under the influence of the 
<br />
prevailing warfare spirit consequently, it became inevitably the 
<br />
Fourth World War of the 20th century. An economic, social, political 
<br />
and cultural struggle supported by ICT for allowing the big 
<br />
corporations to organise the Globalisation of Free Marketing. In 
<br />
fact, this is a biased globalisation that basically aims at 
<br />
increasing ad infinitum the competitiveness of this Marketing. Why?
<br />
<p>It intends to make more and more profitable their involvement in 
<br />
business, financing and economic transactions, without recognising 
<br />
how indispensable have become for billions of humans to have enough 
<br />
employment, education and health services, for allowing all of them 
<br />
to organize their daily survival. Neither it is recognised that the 
<br />
development of the whole human society: the homosphere needs to be 
<br />
organised according to ecological, biological, ethological and 
<br />
ethical criteria.
<br />
<p>How it has happened that decision-makers have become not only 
<br />
seriously 'blind and deaf' but unable to be aware of noticing that 
<br />
this competitiveness has become the source of unemployment, poverty, 
<br />
misery, criminality and terrorism, which sooner or later, will 
<br />
inevitably reduce the same competitiveness?
<br />
<p>Anyhow, this Free Marketing is continuously reconceived and 
<br />
implemented again and again by those few who believe that they can 
<br />
always learn to produce everything and anything that may be consumed 
<br />
by the masses. Consequently, they also assume that the common people 
<br />
do need no more than to learn to buy and consume more and more, 
<br />
whatever the consequences might be; learning on their own to be 
<br />
creative enough when they do not have enough money, or are definitely 
<br />
unemployed.
<br />
<p>This globalisation, attained through this Fourth World War - an 
<br />
economic, cultural and political global phenomenon, - has emerged 
<br />
from the unavoidable warring against the enemies of progress, 
<br />
ideologically supported by the modernised neo-liberal ideology. This 
<br />
globalisation is the main concern of the very clever, therefore also 
<br />
efficient business which has determined what the main concern of the 
<br />
big corporations should be. This concern inevitably requires that 
<br />
both ethnical and national values must be removed because they are 
<br />
not anymore needed for the survival of homogenised masses, which 
<br />
should be efficiently trained and tamed as parts of ultra-modern 
<br />
Megamachines. These aims being determined in accordance with criteria 
<br />
conceived inside big corporations, where it is considered that 
<br />
neither borders nor states are necessary for the functionality of the 
<br />
huge and  highly  civilized free marketing.
<br />
<p>Meanwhile it is intended to allow some big corporations to use 
<br />
governments, which should efficiently and systematically increase the 
<br />
number of homogeneous individuals, because it is assumed that 
<br />
individual motivations and social and cultural concerns should not 
<br />
differ at all.
<br />
<p>Unfortunately for the perspective imagined and planned inside the big 
<br />
corporations, the whole process has become the engine that generates 
<br />
the globalisation of unemployment, poverty, misery, corruption, 
<br />
criminality, hypocrisy, cynicism,... and even frivolity.
<br />
<p>Today it is clearly evident that the remains of every other 
<br />
non-western culture could not resist the invitation or the simple 
<br />
infection to enjoy the magnificent CIVILIZING progress that is 
<br />
heralded every day by those who are organizing the voracious 
<br />
exploitation of the terrestrial resources, starting with petroleum.
<br />
<p>In my view the serious problems that humankind faces at the dawn of 
<br />
the 21st century confirm the appreciation made by Ludwig von 
<br />
Bertalanffy more than 30 years ago. He argued that the overall fate 
<br />
of the world depends on the adoption by humanity of a new set of 
<br />
values, based on a general systems Weltanschauung (worldview). &quot;We 
<br />
are seeking another basic outlook: the world as organization. This 
<br />
[outlook] would profoundly change the categories of our thinking and 
<br />
influence our practical attitudes. We must envision the biosphere as 
<br />
a whole ... with mutually reinforcing or mutually destructive 
<br />
interdependencies. [We need] a global system of mutually symbiotic 
<br />
societies, mapping new conditions into a flexible institutional 
<br />
structure and dealing with change through constructive 
<br />
reorganization.&quot;
<br />
<p>I sincerely believe that the conceptual potentiality of systems 
<br />
thinking, information, cybernetic interactions, organization and 
<br />
humane performance of humans may allow some of us to deal with the 
<br />
serious problems that faces humankind at present.
