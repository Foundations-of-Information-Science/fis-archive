                    my messages to either you or the fis list.

                    Dear FIS colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>Another interesting question about biomolecular networks may concern the
                    <br />
                    overall characterization of their emergent &quot;dynamics&quot; regarding the
                    <br />
                    parallel, we have so often discussed, with mechanical/Newtonian
                    <br />
                    dynamics. Let me attempt that exercise in a trivial way:
                    <br />
                <p>1. (&quot;Inertia&quot;) The living is continuously engaged in the advancement of
                    <br />
                    a manifold trajectory: the life cycle of self-re-production.
                    <br />
                <p>2. (&quot;Force &amp; Acceleration&quot;) The advancement of the life cycle across the
                    <br />
                    inner structure of checkpoints is propelled (or nullified) by the
                    <br />
                    incoming environmental affordances.
                    <br />
                <p>3. (&quot;Action and Reaction&quot;) Effects of signaling events are irrespective
                    <br />
                    of their material underpinning.
                    <br />
                <p>Point 1 basically concerns generative information, the consequences of
                    <br />
                    handling fabrication blueprints; point 2 is mostly about the processual
                    <br />
                    structures (and is highly related to ongoing discussions in systems
                    <br />
                    biology); while point 3 concerns the asymmetry of communication
                    <br />
                    phenomena and the systemic &quot;freedom&quot; in the cellular elaboration of meaning.
                    <br />
                <p>To reiterate the paradox: as one can find in most papers and texts on
                    <br />
                    biomolecular matters, the notion of mechanism seems to be valid up and
                    <br />
                    down any conceivable scale, particularly at the molecular level---what
                    <br />
                    is then the source of these strange emergences utterly culminating in
                    <br />
                    minds and consciousness? Surreptitious dualism?
                    <br />
                    --------------------------
                    <br />
                <p>Yes, this is too mechanistic for me. Pedro, you have neglected an
                    <br />
                    important Newtonian concept: friction. It is the dissipating force, and
                    <br />
                    appears in biology both as loss of usable energy, and the loss of usable
                    <br />
                    information (at least these two). The above do indeed give a mechanistic
                    <br />
                    system in the sense that we can in principle model any system depending
                    <br />
                    on only these factors (without friction) in terms of terminating
                    <br />
                    algorithms (if we include approximations that fit the trajectory within
                    <br />
                    some epsilon for some later time t1. In fact this is true of all systems
                    <br />
                    that fit the Hamiltonian formulation of physics. These are the
                    <br />
                    reversible systems, for which t can be inversed, and the result will
                    <br />
                    also fit the system laws.
                    <br />
                <p>If a system has either small or large dissipation, it can be
                    <br />
                    approximated as a Hamiltonian with corrections (small case) or as a
                    <br />
                    Hamiltonian with a step function (large case). In between, however, we
                    <br />
                    are in the realm that allows self-organization. If there are two or more
                    <br />
                    attractors then the attractor that ends up capturing the system in a
                    <br />
                    steady state cannot be predicted beyond probability. There is a bit
                    <br />
                    lengthier argument below.
                    <br />
                <p>Incidentally, this was what I was trying to lead Loet to a while back
                    <br />
                    when I argued that no new information arises from sociality alone. This
                    <br />
                    is just one of many difficult cases. Many physicists will say (as they
                    <br />
                    have to me) that the phase space of the system is a given, and thus all
                    <br />
                    of the information in the system is given in advance by that structure
                    <br />
                    of that phase space, so new information is impossible. I say that if we
                    <br />
                    have dissipation of the same order as that of a central property of the
                    <br />
                    system (especially its cohesion, or dynamical individuating property --
                    <br />
                    see, e.g. Collier and Hooker, &#x201c;Complexly Organised Dynamical Systems&#x201d;,
                    <br />
                    Open Systems and Information Dynamics , 6 (1999): 241-302), then new
                    <br />
                    information can appear, in the sense that a) it cannot be computed from
                    <br />
                    the original system, as long as its properties are localized, and b)
                    <br />
                    nothing can control the system to select one attractor over another
                    <br />
                    (unless it uses high power and substantially changes the phase space
                    <br />
                    itself).
                    <br />
                <p>What I was trying to lead Loet to was the requirement of additional
                    <br />
                    conditions on mere sociality, but he cleverly blocked my attempt to
                    <br />
                    illuminate him.
                    <br />
                <p>Of course there is nothing really new here; it's all in von Foerster. We
                    <br />
                    need to learn to learn from our ancestors, or we in fis will continue to

                    Here is the full text of a short comment I published on the topic:
                    <br />
                    Collier, John (2004) Reduction, Supervenience, and Physical Emergence,
                    <br />
                    Behavioral and Brain Sciences 27:5, pp 629-630.
                    <br />
                    Abstract:
                    <br />
                    After distinguishing reductive explanability in principle from
                    <br />
                    ontological deflation, I give a case of an obviously physical property
                    <br />
                    that is reductively inexplicable in principle. I argue that biological
                    <br />
                    systems often have this character, and that if we make certain
                    <br />
                    assumptions about the cohesion and dynamics of the mind and its physical
                    <br />
                    substrate, then it is emergent according to Broad&#x2019;s criteria.
                    <br />
                <p>Reduction is ambiguous in three ways. It might mean intertheoretic
                    <br />
                    reduction, the reduction of fundamental kinds of things (substance,
                    <br />
                    traditionally), or that certain particular entities (objects, processes
                    <br />
                    or properties) can be eliminated without any loss of explanatory power
                    <br />
                    in principle. I will ignore intertheoretic reduction. The reduction of
                    <br />
                    the number of fundamental kinds of things is best called ontological
                    <br />
                    deflation. I will assume the closure of the physical (physicalism). And
                    <br />
                    I will assume that all scientific explanation is in some sense causal,
                    <br />
                    and that explanatory power is lost only if the causal nature of a higher
                    <br />
                    level entity is not in principle completely reductively explicable.
                    <br />
                <p>Despite supervenience, if explanatory reducibility fails in principle
                    <br />
                    for some entity, then it is emergent. If there is no possible argument
                    <br />
                    (deductive or inductive) from the parts, their intrinsic properties, and
                    <br />
                    their relations to the full causal powers of the entity itself, then
                    <br />
                    reductive explanation fails in principle. I will show that this holds
                    <br />
                    for certain obviously physical properties of some systems under certain
                    <br />
                    specific conditions. I will further argue that this helps to identify a
                    <br />
                    class of systems for which reductive explanability fails. In these
                    <br />
                    cases, even if physicalism is true, they are emergent. This idea of
                    <br />
                    emergence fits C. D. Broad&#x2019;s criteria (Collier and Muller 1998).

                    <br />
                    two times it revolves around the Sun. This was extremely surprising,
                    <br />
                    since it had been thought that it would be in the same 1:1 harmonic as
                    <br />
                    our Moon-Earth system. There are several more complex harmonic relations
                    <br />
                    in the Solar System. It is well known that the three body gravitational
                    <br />
                    problem is not solvable analytically, but it can be solved numerically,
                    <br />
                    in principle, to any degree of accuracy we might require for any finite
                    <br />
                    time (this is true for any Hamiltonian system). However, these cases
                    <br />
                    involve the dissipation of energy through tidal torques, unless the
                    <br />
                    system is in some harmonic ratio. We would like, ideally, a complete
                    <br />
                    explanation (possibly probabilistic) of why Mercury is in a 3:2
                    <br />
                    harmonic. Due to the high mass of the sun and the proximity of Mercury
                    <br />
                    to the Sun, the high tidal torque dissipates energy reasonably quickly
                    <br />
                    in astronomical time, so Mercury is very likely to end up in some
                    <br />
                    harmonic ratio in a finite amount of time. The central explanatory
                    <br />
                    problem then becomes &#x201c;why a 3:2 ratio rather than a 1:1 ratio like our
                    <br />
                    Moon, or some other harmonic ratio?&#x201d;
                    <br />
                <p>We cannot apply Hamiltonian methods, since the rate of dissipation is
                    <br />
                    roughly the same as the characteristic rate of the phenomenon to be
                    <br />
                    explained. If the dissipation rate were small, then we could use an
                    <br />
                    approximate Hamiltonian; if it were large, we could use a step function.
                    <br />
                    We are left with the Lagrangian. It is well known that these are not
                    <br />
                    always solvable even by numerical approximation. I will give an
                    <br />
                    intuitive argument that the Mercury&#x2019;s harmonic is such a case. Each of
                    <br />
                    the possible harmonics is an attractor. Why one attractor rather than
                    <br />
                    another? If the system were Hamiltonian, then the system would be in one
                    <br />
                    attractor or another. In principle we could take into account the
                    <br />
                    effects of all other bodies on Mercury and the Sun (assuming the
                    <br />
                    universe is finite, or at least that the effects are finite), and decide
                    <br />
                    with an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy which attractor the system
                    <br />
                    is in. However, given the dissipative nature of the system, it ends up
                    <br />
                    in one attractor or another in finite time. If we examine the boundaries
                    <br />
                    between the attractors, they are fractal, meaning that every two points
                    <br />
                    in one attractor have a point between them in another attractor, at
                    <br />
                    least in the boundary region. This is as if the three body gravitational
                    <br />
                    problem had to be decided in finite time, which is impossible by
                    <br />
                    numerical approximation (the problem is non computable, even by
                    <br />
                    convergent approximation). Therefore there can in principle be no
                    <br />
                    complete explanation of why the Mercury-Sun system is in a 3:2 harmonic.
                    <br />
                    There is approximately a chance of 3:2 capture, � of a 1:1 capture, and
                    <br />
                    the rest of the harmonics take up the rest of the chances. The chances
                    <br />
                    of a 3:2 capture are good, but not that good. The system is obviously
                    <br />
                    physical, but it has a nonreducible property. This property fits Broad&#x2019;s
                    <br />
                    notion of emergence.
                    <br />
                <p>How does this apply to the mind? It is highly likely that there are
                    <br />
                    nonlinear dissipative processes in the brain in which the rates of the
                    <br />
                    processes are of the same order as the rate of dissipation. There are
                    <br />
                    also likely to be huge numbers of attractors. The larger the number of
                    <br />
                    attractors, the lower the probabilities of capture in any particular
                    <br />
                    one, generally, so a complete reductive explanation seems to be highly
                    <br />
                    unlikely. This case is certainly true for many biological processes (as
                    <br />
                    in development and in evolution; see Brooks and Wiley 1988 and Kauffman
                    <br />
                    1990). The brain is, after all, biological. We must explain backwards
                    <br />
                    from the attractors that are formed, i.e., downwards from constraints on
                    <br />
                    the constituent physical processes that the order found in the
                    <br />
                    attractors that &#x201c;win&#x201d; supervene on (Campbell 1974).
                    <br />
                <p>But the situation is worse. Certain properties hold a system together
                    <br />
                    (called cohesion in Collier 1986, 1988, Collier and Muller 1998, Collier
                    <br />
                    and Hooker 1999). Cohesion is the unity relation for a dynamical system
                    <br />
                    (previous references and Collier 2002). The unity relation is the basis
                    <br />
                    of the identity of an entity. If the property of cohesion is
                    <br />
                    nonreducible, then the object is nonreducible (not the kind of object;
                    <br />
                    that can vary). It is certainly possible that the cohesion of the mind,
                    <br />
                    if there is such a cohesive thing, is of this sort. Kim&#x2019;s arguments
                    <br />
                    address ontological deflation (and kinds of objects), not emergence in
                    <br />
                    particular dynamical systems. It is quite possible for an entity to be
                    <br />
                    physical in every respect, but not to be reducible in any way that is
                    <br />
                    relevant to complete scientific explanation, even in principle.
