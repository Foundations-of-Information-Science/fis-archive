<p>
Dear congeners,
<br />
<p>This problem is a challenge for many of us who are inclined to 
<br />
ORGANIZE solidarity actions for helping all those of our congeners 
<br />
who are confronted to simplistic and inhumane interpretations of how 
<br />
humans should behave.
<br />
<p>I dare to suggest that we might send an e-mail message to every 
<br />
Pakistani Embassy
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Monsieur l'Ambassadeur,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Je vous prie de demander au President de Pakistan de
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sauver la vie de Zafran Bibi
<br />
<p>Merci,
<br />
<p>Signature

<p><p><p>Pakistani mother who was raped faces death by stoning for adultery
<br />
<p>Rory McCarthy in Kohat
<br />
<p>Zafran Bibi walked into the police station in the village of Kerri 
<br />
Sheikhan, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, and told how 
<br />
she had been raped by a neighbour.
<br />
<p>Medical tests were ordered, witnesses questioned and a trial was 
<br />
held. Defence lawyers were called in. But Pakistan's archaic legal 
<br />
system, a mix of secular and Islamic codes, offers little protection 
<br />
for women.
<br />
<p>Bibi, 28, was convicted of adultery under Islamic laws that many 
<br />
regard as deeply prejudicial. Last month, a year after she reported 
<br />
the rape, a judge sentenced her to death by stoning. For several 
<br />
weeks the young mother has lived in solitary confinement in a death 
<br />
cell in Kohat jail nursing her seven-month-old daughter. An appeal 
<br />
will be heard before an Islamic court in Islamabad this month.
<br />
Her case has exposed the empty promises of Pakistan's military 
<br />
regime, which has committed itself to improving women's rights and 
<br />
countering religious extremism. General Pervez Musharraf, the 
<br />
military ruler, knew nothing of the case until he was questioned by 
<br />
foreign journalists last week. &quot;Is that the law?&quot; he asked. &quot;Now? I 
<br />
don't even know.&quot; He was asked if he would reform the adultery laws, 
<br />
introduced in 1979 by the last military dictator, Zia-ul Haq. 
<br />
&quot;Frankly, I haven't given it such deep thought,&quot; he said.
<br />
<p>The urbane general, sitting in his lavish office in Islamabad, 
<br />
insisted that Bibi would not be executed. But hundreds more women who 
<br />
have reported rapes are held in jail under the same adultery law.
<br />
It appears Bibi was used by relatives caught up in a family feud, and 
<br />
her husband claims she suffered from poor legal advice. Her account 
<br />
of what happened has never been heard. In remote villages such as 
<br />
Kerri Sheikhan, the word of a young, uneducated mother counts for 
<br />
little.
<br />
<p>In March last year Bibi went to the village police station with her 
<br />
father-in-law, Zabita Khan, and said she had been raped while cutting 
<br />
grass outside the village. She named Akmal Khan, a villager involved 
<br />
in a long-running dispute with her family, as her attacker. At the 
<br />
time, her husband was in jail for murder.
<br />
<p>She was examined by a doctor and found to be seven to eight weeks 
<br />
pregnant, which appears to have convinced the judge she was guilty of 
<br />
adultery. She later insisted that the baby was conceived during a 
<br />
conjugal visit to her husband in jail.
<br />
<p>Last October the trial opened and Bibi appeared in court. She 
<br />
recorded a statement repeating the claim of rape and again naming 
<br />
Akmal Khan. But at the next hearing she said her father-in-law had 
<br />
pressured her into making the accusation. In a new statement she 
<br />
named her brother-in-law Jamal, 15, as the rapist.
<br />
<p>The judge acquitted Akmal Khan. But no investigation was ordered into 
<br />
the new accusation and Jamal was never arrested. The judge ruled that 
<br />
the medical evidence showed no signs of force, and that her pregnancy 
<br />
was evidence of adultery. &quot;Resultantly, I hereby convict and sentence 
<br />
the accused Zafran Bibi to stoning to death and that she be stoned to 
<br />
death at a public place,&quot; Judge Anwar Ali Khan wrote in his final 
<br />
judgment.
<br />
<p>Her lawyers were stunned. In the court at Kohat last week they were 
<br />
still arguing over the case. &quot;She has never confessed her guilt. 
<br />
There is no  case against her,&quot; said Sardar Ali, one of her original 
<br />
defence lawyers.
<br />
<p>Under the Offence of Zina Ordinance, which covers both rape and 
<br />
adultery under the Islamic code, a conviction requires either a 
<br />
confession from the accused or evidence from four witnesses to the 
<br />
crime who are Muslim men who &quot;abstain from major sins&quot;. When rape is 
<br />
not proven, women are then often charged with adultery. As a result 
<br />
most rapes are never reported, even though the Human Rights 
<br />
Commission of Pakistan estimates that a woman in the country is raped 
<br />
every two hours.
<br />
<p>In Bibi's case the judge ruled that the fact she changed her 
<br />
statement to name a new attacker was a confession of adultery. &quot;She 
<br />
made herself guilty in that statement when she clearly admits she had 
<br />
committed zina [adultery] with her brother-in-law,&quot; said Kurshid 
<br />
Anwar, a prosecutor in the case. &quot;There was no mark of violence on 
<br />
her body. It was the right decision as long as the law exists.&quot; Later 
<br />
Anwar admitted that he favoured &quot;modernisation&quot; of the law.
<br />
<p>Outside Kohat jail last week Bibi's husband, Naimat Khan, and his two 
<br />
sons, Israr, nine, and Rehman, six,  tried to arrange a visit to his 
<br />
wife. Only the children were allowed in.&quot;The defence lawyers told us 
<br />
this would be an easy case. Then they told my wife if she didn't 
<br />
change her statement she would be tied to a pole and soldiers would 
<br />
throw stones at her,&quot; said Naimat Khan, 40, a poor farmer who makes 
<br />
less than $600 a year from his fields. In an affidavit written for 
<br />
the appeal hearing, Bibi again pleaded her innocence. &quot;I have not 
<br />
committed zina with anybody,&quot; she said. &quot;I have not confessed any 
<br />
guilt.&quot;
<br />
While Bibi's conviction may be overturned on appeal this month, it is 
<br />
clear the military regime is unwilling to reform Islamic laws for 
<br />
fear of angering the religious right.
<br />
<p>&quot;She is not the first case and she is not going to be the last,&quot; said 
<br />
Afrasiab Khattak, chairman of the Human Rights Commission of 
<br />
Pakistan. &quot;If General Musharraf really wants to do away with 
<br />
extremism, then there is no alternative to doing away with the 
<br />
structures created by Zia, which include the so-called Islamic laws.
<br />
<p>&quot;Even if Zafran Bibi returns to her village now, the stigma is so 
<br />
severe that it will be a very harsh life for her and her children.&quot;
