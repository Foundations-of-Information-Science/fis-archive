Dear Rafael, Karl, James, and All:
<br />
<p>This is another long email addressing the views expressed in response 
<br />
to the potential for a grounding of information.  This thread was 
<br />
motivated by Rafael suggestion that such a grounding within 
<br />
metaphysics may be possible.  My previous post on this subject is 
<br />
appended at the end of this message if you would like to refresh your 
<br />
memories of the issues under discussion.
<br />
<p>Rafael:
<br />
Your response was appreciated. You covered vast territories.  From 
<br />
the engineering perspective of Shannon, which lies at the root of the 
<br />
current questions, it seems that an alternative route to a relation 
<br />
between metaphysics and information is conceivable.   (Fortunately, 
<br />
the work, &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; is available on 
<br />
line so that we can read the same text.  The address is: 
<br />
<a href="../../cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html</a> )
<br />
<p>It is critical to recognize the foundation of engineering information 
<br />
in order to distinguish it from other forms of information used in 
<br />
physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, etc.  As is often the case in 
<br />
engineering, one seeks a simple way to accomplish a task. Shannon is 
<br />
very explicit about his objectives (Introduction,page 31),
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at 
<br />
one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at 
<br />
another point.&quot;
<br />
<p>This statement implies that MORE THAN ONE SYSTEM is essential for 
<br />
engineering communication.  Later, Shannon is explicit about the 
<br />
number of different systems required for engineering communication: 
<br />
(see Figure 1, p. 34.)
<br />
By a communication system we will mean a system of a type indicated 
<br />
schematically in Figure 1. it consists of essentially five parts:
<br />
1. An information source which produces a message or sequence of 
<br />
messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal....
<br />
2. A transmitter which operates on the message in some way to produce 
<br />
a signal suitable for transmission over the channel.
<br />
3. The channel is merely the medium used to transmit the signal from 
<br />
the transmitter to the receiver.
<br />
4. The receiver ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that 
<br />
done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.
<br />
5. The destination is the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended.
<br />
<p>How do these five components of communication relate to the 
<br />
engineering mathematics that is often compared with entropy?
<br />
<p>NO DIRECT RELATION EXISTS!
<br />
<p>What is missing from this list of five components is the concept of 
<br />
noise.  it is the concept of noise, that generates the uncertainty 
<br />
and the entropy-like equation (see Figure 1.!)
<br />
<p>Shannon's engineering mathematics is based solely on the temporal 
<br />
duration of the time required to transmit a symbol over the channel. 
<br />
(One of his examples is based on the Morse code and telegraphic 
<br />
transmission.)  On page 37, Shannon states:
<br />
&quot;Each of the symbols S(i) is assumed to have a certain duration of in 
<br />
time t(i) seconds (not necessarily the same for for different S(i), 
<br />
for example the dots and dashes of in telegraphy.)
<br />
<p>What theory does Shannon use to justify the mathematical measure of a 
<br />
logarithm for measuring &quot;information&quot;?
<br />
<p>NONE!  Rather, Shannon offers three utilitarian justifications: (page 32)
<br />
<p>1. It is practically more useful.
<br />
2. It is nearer to our intuitive feelings as to the proper measure
<br />
3. It is mathematically more suitable.
<br />
<p>These three justifications are certainly not relevant to measures of 
<br />
chemical communication in living systems. Nor are these three 
<br />
justifications related to measures of  human communication in 
<br />
general.  (See the work of Boisot cited in my abstract.)  I conclude 
<br />
that Shannon's justification of the basic measure of information is 
<br />
not related to measuring information in dynamic biochemical systems 
<br />
or other biological or human situations.  The mathematics used to 
<br />
measure information must stand in a direct correspondence relation 
<br />
with the transmission itself.
<br />
<p>How do Shannon's engineering formulas relate to metaphysical 
<br />
primitives?  I suggest that a relation could exist through the 
<br />
primitive notion of &quot;identity&quot;.
<br />
Exchange of information requires two or more systems, each with a 
<br />
separate identity.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMISSION from one system is essential BEFORE transmission to one or 
<br />
more other systems.  The essential nature of communication is 
<br />
conceptually dependent on the relation between systems; THE CONCEPT 
<br />
OF &quot;NOISE&quot; IS SECONDARY TO THE METAPHYSICAL PRIMITIVES OF IDENTITY 
<br />
AND RELATIONS BETWEEN IDENTITIES.  Thus, the engineering mathematics 
<br />
of Shannon relates to the rates of transmission and the impact of 
<br />
errors on that rate.  A chief concern is the maximum rate or maximum 
<br />
load that a channel can carry, which he names the channel capacity. 
<br />
(see the reference in my abstract to Schneider application of 
<br />
Information theory to DNA recognition for an example of how these 
<br />
functions are adapted to a biochemical circumstance.)
<br />
<p>In this context, one can relate Shannon's information to THREE 
<br />
metaphysical primitives: 1.identity of separate systems, 2. the space 
<br />
separating two or more systems and 3. the time required to carry a 
<br />
message from one system to the other.
<br />
<p>Rafael:
<br />
Does this gloss make any sense to you?
<br />
Can you relate human communication to Shannon's justification of 
<br />
logarithmic measures of information?
<br />
<p>James:  My reference to &quot;Organic communication&quot; could imply that I 
<br />
was distinguishing it from &quot;inorganic&quot;.  However, that is not my 
<br />
intent.  Organic is meant in the sense of  'not inanimate'.  Thus 
<br />
your logic is remote from my intent expressed in my abstract.
<br />
<p>I concur with your quote of Elsasser. The essence of a wave is the 
<br />
essence of a wave.
<br />
<p>Karl:
<br />
<p>Thank you for sending the paper via post.
<br />
We are far apart on basic issues. I remain skeptical on both 
<br />
mathematical and philosophical grounds.  For example, I wrote:
<br />
<p>Could you say more about what you mean by &quot;pre-logical&quot;? I do not 
<br />
understand this usage at all.
<br />
<p>In psychologic terms: whatever is experienced by the older regions of 
<br />
the brain than the cortex is pre-logical. In physical terms: what is 
<br />
there without me being able to deny its existence (for a newborn: 
<br />
breast, light, Sun, gravity, solid things, etc.) Logic is produced in 
<br />
the cortex.  The subcortically registered impressions constitute the 
<br />
set of pre-logical sensations. What you run into and causes pain 
<br />
irrespective of what you think about it is pre-logical. (In 
<br />
Wittgenstein terms: this is what logic is embedded in.)
<br />
<p>Your response suggests that &quot;pre-logical&quot; is related to brain 
<br />
anatomical structures.  I would suggest that this is a confusing 
<br />
usage of the sense of &quot;pre&quot; as &quot;before&quot;; what is implied is a 
<br />
hierarchical organization of mental function.  In this sense, 
<br />
biochemical functions of brain are also &quot;pre-logical&quot;, nicht wahr?
<br />
<p>When you write, A: The chemical systems are not irregular. I have no 
<br />
idea what you are seeking to communicate.  Perhaps you have an 
<br />
example in mind?  Hopefully, in discussing the example, you will 
<br />
relate it to biochemical dynamics as this is the source of biological 
<br />
communication.
<br />
<p>More generally, could you provide an example of representing a 
<br />
chemical molecule in terms of statistical concepts as you see the 
<br />
relations?  More precisely, an exact accounting of the components of 
<br />
a molecule must be related to one another.
<br />
<p>As you can see, we differ on the basics of biology - structure and 
<br />
function; system and emission.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Karl, Rafael, Werner, Pedro and All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This message seeks to address several related points and hence is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit long. The topic of this thread is exactly the related points to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which I am referring. I close this long message with a plea for HELP!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First, thank you Rafael for your excellent summary of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical history of the concept of &quot;thingedness.&quot; It covers the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;history up to the middle of the last century nicely. However, in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;last fifty years, our basic understanding of life and being has been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;altered by the progress in molecular recognition, molecular biology, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecular nutrition, molecular neurology, etc. The basic premise of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chemistry, that all (stable) matter of ordinary experience is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;composed from atoms of the atomic table has been shown to apply to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;life itself. This is a radical change in our knowledge of ourselves. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus, the need for a new metaphysics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, what is the metaphysics of information? My dictionary defines metaphysics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;1. A branch of philosophy that deals with first principles of things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;including such concepts as being, substance, essence, time, space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;cause, and identity; theoretical philosophy as the ultimate science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of being and knowing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This definition shows correspondence relations between basic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concerns of science, space, time, substance, identity and cause and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the basic concerns of metaphysics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What can metaphysicians contribute to this discussion of information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I argue that information is a concept related to communication. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus, when Werner argues that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(I cannot understand why several FISers like to consider information as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a property of a system itself, like mass, energy, momentum in physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me and I believe to any engineer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information is binary as interaction in physics it is a relation between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two things),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(See below, Werner and Shannon appear to be in full agreement on this point.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I strongly support Werner's view (except for the possible ambiguity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the reference for usage of &quot;binary&quot;. Chemical communication is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between two things but a chemical communication is not via a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;binary&quot; object.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As pointed out in my extended abstract, the notion of communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is derived from the root of &quot;common&quot; and hence tightly associated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the concept of community. From this perspective, which draws 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;upon radically different metaphysical foundations, information is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seen as a relation between two things (objects, entities, beings). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This relation can be a simple binary relation (such as a bit, or it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be more complex, a signal, a molecule, a set of molecules, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;page of a written transcript, a musical score, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This metaphysical perspective of information recognizes that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information flows can be &quot;one to many&quot; or &quot;many to one&quot;, as well as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;binary. (See the book by Biosot referenced in my extended abstract.) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Shannon information, as defined, must conform to a bijection, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Shannon's terminology, &quot;to reproduce the message&quot; exactly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My view of &quot;information as a relation between two&quot; (or more) things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was motivated from Shannon's model by relaxing the presupposition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that communication is merely for engineering purposes. From a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metaphysical perspective, I presuppose that a community of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individuals communicate about matters of common concern to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;community. (This FIS list is an example of the preceding sentence)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(The exact quote from Shannon (page 31):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;message at one point either exactly or approximately a message 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;selected at another point. Frequently, messages have meaning, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A second metaphysical problem concerns the metaphysics of time as it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relates to information, particularly the mathematics of information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Shannon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From logic, we know that mathematical symbols are arbitrary. Thus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the meaning of a symbol depends on the assignment to a particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept, thing, entity, idea, relation, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Shannon's mathematical symbols are assigned to mean a relation to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time intervals for transmission of a symbol.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematical symbols for entropy are assigned to mean a relation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with Heat and with other thermodynamic parameters which form the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bilinear group of thermodynamic equations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The metaphysical problem, from this perspective, if one desires 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relate the symbols of information with the symbols of heat, is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find a conversion factor or a narrative or a myth which creates a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bijection between heat and time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rafael - your comment on these views from your perspective of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metaphysics would be warmly welcomed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Karl: I found much to agree with in your response. We concur on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need for a public language. (This concept is closely related to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept of communication in a community; a public language is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;essential to form a community of individuals.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We also agree that on the central role of thingedness in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material world. Your views are close to the typical view of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chemist / biochemist. (I have referred to similar, but conceptually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstract, views as &quot;radical materialism&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But, as noted above, progress in chemistry has given us material 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;descriptions of most &quot;things&quot; in terms of chemical structures and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associated chemical agglomerations and often these descriptions are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strongly supported by quantum mechanical calculations grounded in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics. Many advances of technology are directly relatable to our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new understandings of the dynamical structures of simple components 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of complex objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But, do physicists agree that this is a source of solutions to &quot;deep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And, it appears to me that the recent advances in the chemistry of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;life have created vast new problems for the philosophers. (The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relevance of this comment is questionable... given the nature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical problems.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you say more about what you mean by &quot;pre-logical&quot;? I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand this usage at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With regard to number theory, I remain pretty much in the dark as to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your meaning. I certainly concur that numbers play a critical role 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in science and technology and human communication in general. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact that numbers can be used indexically is crucial. And, numbers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are critical for creating correspondence relations between the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external world (thingedness) and our internal mental images. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Furthermore, numbers play a central role as a central &quot;generator&quot; of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical objects of many types (ie, the concept of species in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;category theory).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your &quot;very technical approach&quot; could be translated as a special type 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of super-reductionism by incorporating temporal relations and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditional propositions into materialism. Can you relate this &quot;very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technical approach&quot; to complex systems and such problems as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Once we have agreement on the existence of a mathematical entity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that behaves like a thing (or &quot;carrier of potential information&quot; in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rafael's parlance) then we shall be able to use this building block 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to build structures with no end in sight. Like once we define this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a Lego building block, we can build very complex and useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models. Indeed, my theory is a fine example of a super-reductionism. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It investigates the translation between logical structures and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carrier objects on which one can observe the logical structures. The

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Intuitively, I find your response very appealing, but I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand how this is to be done. A central problem is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;irregularity of the mathematics of chemical systems. This implies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also the mathematics of living systems. The irregularity of chemical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures and chemical dynamics (living structures and living 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dynamics) denies me access to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the translation between logical structures and carrier objects on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which one can observe the logical structures&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am denied access to this route by the fact that chemical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures are mathematically expressed in terms of labeled graphs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that these labeled graphs can not be placed in correspondence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the natural numbers. In short, each chemical identity (entity, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compound, object, thing) is a unique category.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the concept of time is intertwined with the concept of number. How 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do you justify this interrelation? At issue is the nature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find one of the strong suits of my theory that it uses any kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence and relates its information-carrying capacity to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information-carrying capacity of any kind of contempororary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assembly. One is free to give a sequence (a mathematical entity) an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation as time slices. If you can number it consecutively, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then it is a sequence. I look into the interdependence between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cross-sectional and longitudinal collections of objects (carriers of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbols /information/). In everyday speak this means: I look into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the relations between collections that are here all at the same time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and collections that come one after the other. In a heroic allegory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about a theoretical living organism: the theoretical cell's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constituents are all present at the same time and all (each) of them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is relevant at the same moment, while the theoretical DNA gets read 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;off from start till the end, one (triplet) at a time, one after the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other. In the sequence, it is the neighbourhood relations that count 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(this comes after that), while in the contemporary assembly the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inclusion relations matter (this is like these and like those). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Continuity and discontinuity are discussed at great length and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detail also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok. I now understand part of the mathematical approach. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metaphysical issues concerning time are critical. Would it be fair 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to state that the metaphysical symbol exchange for &quot;time - heat&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simpler than your proposed symbol exchange for &quot;time - matter&quot;?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I propose to transcend the gap between well established principles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of number theory and the concepts of communication between two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collections of message carriers by following steps:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) extend number theory to include multidimensional partitions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hitherto left undefined;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) introduce the concept of the structure of a set by discussing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;properties of multidimensional partitions;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) introduce the technique of linearisations of structured sets;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;4) discuss congruence relations between neighbourhood relations on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence and structures in a set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd prefer not to call neither a structured set (a contemporary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assembly) nor a sequence a system, but the interplay between these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two constitutes a system.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your agenda is clear. Have you published works concerning these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;topics? I would be very interested in the details or in receiving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;electronic copies.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Congratulations to all who have read this far!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can others contribute to the task of creating a new metaphysics that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be inclusive of information?
