                    <br />
                    Thanks a lot for the references. I'll begin by reading your draft.
                    <br />
                    (Unfortunately, I cannot cc this to the list because of the moderator's
                    <br />
                    limitations to two contributions each week.)
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Obviously, I should not have used the word &quot;mathematical&quot;; perhaps,
                    <br />
                    &quot;non-linear dynamics&quot; would have done the job? May I take the opportunity to
                    <br />
                    include below a draft of my abstract for the World Congress of Sociology in
                    <br />
                    your city (Durban)? I have to remain below 200 words, but I wonder whether
                    <br />
                    it is understandable:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Yes, it was the 'mathematical' that misled me. I would agree with pretty
                    <br />
                    much all of what you say below. I think that it is on the right track. [...]
                    <br />
                    What you say below is untouched by my remarks (it's hardly reductionist!).
                    <br />
                    Pity you couldn't have replied on the list. I could have approved, and we
                    <br />
                    could have advanced another step (hopefully) in the collective history of

                    <br />
                <p>Social order cannot be expected to exist as a stable phenomenon, but it can
                    <br />
                    be considered as an order of expectations which are reproduced. Thus, a
                    <br />
                    non-linear dynamics of meaning is generated: specific meaning can be
                    <br />
                    stabilized, for example, in social institutions, but all meaning refers to a
                    <br />
                    global horizon of possible meanings. Using Luhmann�s social systems theory
                    <br />
                    and Rosen�s (biological) theory of anticipatory systems, I submit algorithms
                    <br />
                    for modeling the exchange of meaning in social systems and the non-linear
                    <br />
                    dynamics of expectations. First, a system which contains a model of itself
                    <br />
                    can use this model for the anticipation. Under the condition of functional
                    <br />
                    differentiation, the social system can be expected to entertain a multitude
                    <br />
                    of models; each model contains also a model of all other models. Two
                    <br />
                    anticipatory mechanisms are then possible: one transversal between the
                    <br />
                    models, and a longitudinal one providing the system with this variety of
                    <br />
                    meanings. A system containing two anticipatory mechanisms can become
                    <br />
                    hyper-incursive. Without taking decisions the uncertainty in a
                    <br />
                    hyper-incursive system would explode. Under this pressure, informed
                    <br />
                    decisions tend to replace �natural preferences� of agents. In a
                    <br />
                    knowledge-based order, action and organization are transformed into
                    <br />
                    decision-making structures because of uncertainty in the reproduction of
                    <br />
                    expectations among differently codified meanings.
                    <br />
                <p>Is this understandable? See you in Durban, but undoubtedly before that on
                    <br />
                    the list.
                    <br />
                    With best wishes,

                <p>
                <p>Before we might be able to measure meaning, we would first need to have a
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>mathematical theory of meaning in order to specify the expectation.

                <p>
                <p>I am pretty sure that a mathematical theory of meaning is not a possibility,
                    <br />
                    for much the same reason as a purely mathematical theory of induction is not
                    <br />
                    possible. There are mathematical constraints on a satisfactory theory of
                    <br />
                    meaning (it must fit model theory, for example, and not contradict the
                    <br />
                    lambda calculus), and the formal aspects must be able to be embodied in a
                    <br />
                    suitable metaphysics, but as soon as you get to this point you have left
                    <br />
                    mathematics. Barwise and Perry's situational semantics offers and embodiable
                    <br />
                    mathematics, but violates a context free version model theory.
                    <br />
                    Talmont-Kaminski and myself suggest a modification of the Barwise-Perry
                    <br />
                    approach inspired by Peirce that allows a Montague style semantics and
                    <br />
                    pragmatics to be recovered, but that is only after we determine meaning by
                    <br />
                    non formal techniques. The problems and the solution are outlined in our
                    <br />
                    &quot;Pragmatist Pragmatics&quot; due out later this year in Philosophica. There is a
                    <br />
                    draft version at
                    <br />
                    <a

                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Incidentally, since it is arguable that there is no mathematical theory that
                    <br />
                    captures exactly the concept of number, the above should not be surprising.
                    <br />
                    Barwise was motivated by this problem, but we feel he and Perry thew more
                    <br />
                    out than they needed to. My supervisor, Bill Demopoulos, wrote a paper, The
                    <br />
                    Philosophical Basis of Our Knowledge of Number, No&amp;ucirc;s &gt; Vol. 32, No.
                    <br />
                    4 (Dec., 1998), pp. 481-503, in which he argues that formal methods can
                    <br />
                    give us a set of entities suitable for number theory (part of pure
                    <br />
                    mathematics) but cannot give us a set of entities corresponding to our
                    <br />
                    everyday use of number. The main problem to overcome has been long known as
                    <br />
                    the Julius Caesar problem, since Fregean formalism, as Frege knew, cannot
                    <br />
                    rule out Julius Caesar being a number. Demopoulos'solution is the same one I
                    <br />
                    would advocate. In any case, since a purely mathematical theory of number is
                    <br />
                    impossible, it follows directly that a purely mathematical theory of meaning
                    <br />
                    is impossible. I noted this in my PhD thesis (which, not surprisingly,
                    <br />
                    Demopoulos supervised), and used the result to argue that Kuhnian

                    incommensurability cannot be resolved by purely formal approaches (it is not
                    <br />
                    a purely formal problem). Incommensurability, in fact, is a direct result of
                    <br />
                    making two assumptions 1) that any difference in meaning must make a
                    <br />
                    difference to possible experience (Peirce's Pragmatic Maxim) and 2) the
                    <br />
                    weakest verificationism. The latter, verificationism, is a direct
                    <br />
                    consequence of thinking that a mathematical theory of meaning can exhaust
                    <br />
                    meaning. If one holds both 1 and 2, then incommensurability is inevitable,
                    <br />
                    and there will be an appearance that truth is constructed. However, I would
                    <br />
                    say that that appearance is an illusion of accepting 2. It is quite easy to
                    <br />
                    assume 2 without knowing it, but the typical strategy that presupposes some
                    <br />
                    version of 2 is to identify truth and/or meaning with something else that is
                    <br />
                    not truth and/or meaning, but something more tractable.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Loet may not have meant that a mathematical theory of meaning would tell us
                    <br />
                    what meaning is, since he may think that it has other aspects as well that
                    <br />
                    are not mathematical (as I would say mathematical physics does). If so, I
                    <br />
                    submit that all the mathematics we need for a theory of meaning are already
                    <br />
                    available to us. But the hard work is only begun.
