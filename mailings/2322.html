                    </em><br />
                <p>Sorry, Loet, but I really don't know what you mean by that. If reality or
                    <br />
                    nature or whatever is a social construction, then we are testing against
                    <br />
                    reality or nature or whatever. If it is not, then we are testing against
                    <br />
                    something else. If external reality is a social construction, then it
                    <br />
                    exists. I assume that whatever it is that can surprise us in tests is
                    <br />
                    external reality. Certainly what we construct can surprise us. My
                    <br />
                    concern is that we don't trivially test against what must be the case.
                    <br />
                    I honestly don't know how to construct the situation you seem to be
                    <br />
                    proposing in a consistent way, so I probably haven't responded to
                    <br />
                    you in a way that you approve of. Basically, the only construction
                    <br />
                    that I can see that is both coherent and consistent is that there is
                    <br />
                    no external reality, or internal one either. Their is just reality, which
                    <br />
                    we are a part of. The problem then is to separate reality into parts
                    <br />
                    that are epistemologically relevant. There is evidence, and there are
                    <br />
                    hypotheses. We test hypotheses against evidence. If there are
                    <br />
                    disagreements about evidence, then we need to test hypotheses
                    <br />
                    about what we thought was evidence. If we can't test these, then
                    <br />
                    there is nothing to argue about. The distinction that you are trying
                    <br />
                    to make seems to me to fall into this last class, and consequently,
                    <br />
                    on the Pragamtic Maxim, it makes no difference to meaning. if
                    <br />
                    you want to talk that way, fine with me, but don't fool yourself into
                    <br />
                    thinking you are saying something substantive. You are just indicating
                    <br />
                    by a style of discourse that you fit in with a certain manner of thinking
                    <br />
                    that has a certain history. There is really nothing to that that is
                    <br />
                    substantive or testable except that you do fit into that style. It is
                    <br />
                    sort of like being Muslim.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This does not preclude that we may be able to construct tests, for example,
                    </em><br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to be constructed. Unlike biology, the social sciences cannot proceed

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;irreflexively in this respect because they can no longer assume a

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;out there.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Sorry, again I do not see why. can you give me a clear example that
                    <br />
                    clearly differs from the non social sciences? Are you saying that there is
                    <br />
                    no social reality? If so, how could it be the subject of anything, let alone
                    <br />
                    science? I am unclear what you mean by 'irreflexively'. Aren't we biological
                    <br />
                    and physical too? We can change our biological and physical parametres,
                    <br />
                    so that can't be the difference. Of course all measurements depend on
                    <br />
                    the operationalization and theory of measurement (see Mach, for example
                    <br />
                    on these topics in physics). I am unclear what you mean by epistemic
                    <br />
                    objects being constructed. Do you mean that we have to find some way to
                    <br />
                    decide what to measure? If not, what different (testable) are you proposing?
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Nature&quot; as a given implies the Leibnizian assumption, as we
                        agreed in a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;previous exchange. We are no longer considering an order which was given
                        (in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the revelation), but an order which is emerging on the basis of
                        interaction
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and recursion/incursion.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Nature as a given seems to me to have nothing to do with the
                    <br />
                    current discussion. I don't see why you think it does. Nature
                    <br />
                    changes constantly, whether we are involved or not. Some things
                    <br />
                    stay the same though, or else science would be impossible. Or
                    <br />
                    do you think that what is special about social phenomena is
                    <br />
                    that there are no interesting things that are relatively constant?
                    <br />
                    That would be an interesting and testable position.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example, in a relatively straightforward study with Nienke Oomes I
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;studied the emergence of the European Monetary System during the 1980s and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 1990s. We could show when in the early 1990s the Markov property
                        became
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;a better predictor than the assumption of independent development of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;European currencies which co-evolved with the German mark. Thus, one is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;sometimes able to test hypotheses against each other.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Similarly, in a study with Koen Frenken we could show that the DC4
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;functioned as the dominant design in aircraft development rather than the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;DC3. These were relatively simple operationalizations. The
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;operationalization of a meaning-processing system would be much more
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Again, I am unclear what your point is. Do you mean that if we did a study
                    <br />
                    in some other way the DC4 (basically not successful) would not have been
                    <br />
                    the dominant design in aircraft development rather than the DC3 (hugely
                    <br />
                    successful, and therefore not much reason to improve on)? Would this
                    <br />
                    alternative perspective have changed what the engineers did, and what
                    <br />
                    their reasons were? St Aquinas said that even God couldn't change
                    <br />
                    history. Are you making social scientists greater than God?
