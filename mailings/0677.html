<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>In my yesterday posting  there were several typos and misconstructions 
<br />
that, in the rush, passed through (in the opening sentence my 'mess.' was 
<br />
an abbreviation for messages, applied to Edwina-Jerry's exchanges 
<br />
--actually I found them quite clear and interesting; and the Table of 
<br />
contents that Edwina included was very stimulating--thanks!).
<br />
<p>To close my comments on biofunction --am affraid yesterday I crammed too 
<br />
many things together-- let me return to the common ground of 'molecular 
<br />
recognition'. Both in functional and evolutionary grounds, biomol. 
<br />
recogn.  is inherently sloppy. If it  worked exactly and universally within 
<br />
the 'lock and key' style described by classical enzymologists, most of the 
<br />
multifunctionality, resilience, and creativity of life would disappear 
<br />
--and the most sophisticate info inventions, such as cellular signaling 
<br />
systems &amp; nervous systems would be out of existence (yes, computers could 
<br />
exist, so mathematicians and AL people would be happy).  Then, in my 
<br />
yesterday comments I was going beyond that biofunctional sloppiness and 
<br />
compounding it with the amazing distribution of controlling interactions 
<br />
(effectors are the clearest ones) through almost all the stages in the 
<br />
´life cycle´or an enzyme or protein. Thus, emphasizing degradation, I 
<br />
jumped into the 'functional void' idea. The hypothesis is that in the 
<br />
cellular coupling of constructive/degradative processes, it finally becomes 
<br />
easier and cheaper checking for absences... Emphasizing 'absences' may look 
<br />
a bizarre idea, but I  think that, properly developed, provides new grounds 
<br />
to link the basic organization of collective functions by biomolecular 
<br />
agents with the emergence of very high levels of control, such as the 
<br />
'constraint' notion that Cristophe brought into the arena. And it may also 
<br />
link with the conceptualization of biological 'abduction'...
<br />
<p>Cellularly there are quite many caveats to make before cavalierly talking 
<br />
about 'signals &amp; meaning.' The cellular signaling system itself, the 
<br />
'fabric' of signals (and not just the 'detector'), is a very fast changing 
<br />
structure with a previous ontogenetic trajectory of coupling to its 
<br />
changing environment. Some particular fragments of the environmental events 
<br />
will be picked --abduced-- or not, as signals, depending on quite many 
<br />
happenstances (the stage of the life-cycle of the cell appears as the most 
<br />
prominent factor, also the presence or absence of other environmental 
<br />
events). Then each tissue is capable of abducing or fabricating its 
<br />
specific mixing or sampling of events --signals-- out from the same 
<br />
circulatory environment, usually. What I want to emphasize is that the 
<br />
cellular signaling system gets sculpted itself along the 
<br />
living-communication process as a result of the amazing architecture of 
<br />
inner controlling events and biofunctions that I was describing in the 
<br />
above paragraph (with gene expression and protein degradation as the 
<br />
crowning inner events). So, there is a combined world of 
<br />
amorphous'architectures', sequential ones, collections of gradients, etc., 
<br />
that together conspire with their 'info processes' to temporarily maintain 
<br />
the living cell at work.
<br />
<p>Informationally I assume that we could negotiate, more or less,  a common 
<br />
path until molecular recognition. But we do not have a clear taxonomy of 
<br />
the classes of biological info at work yet, even in the simplest cell (and 
<br />
the 'three genera' taxonomy is but a rough delineation). So, if do not have 
<br />
still a rough understanding of the different classes of 'forces' at work, 
<br />
why we do not discuss how to find and to distinguish them? Otherwise our 
<br />
global 'theory of force' will not advance much. I could assume that we 
<br />
finally might be able to unify them, but that may be a long way from now.
<br />
<p>Sorry if I am insisting too much on the discussion about bioinfo. I believe 
<br />
it is the cornerstone of our field.
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
