                <p>
                    Dear Gordana,
                    <br />
                <p>I very much agree with your that dialogue is the main issue in ethics and... morals today. Both
                    levels are intertwinned but are not identical. At the pragmatic (political) level we need a dialogue
                    in order to come
                    <br />
                    to &quot;minima moralia.&quot; This is particular important in the Internet but also in other
                    fields. I call the dialogue at the *scientific* level intercultural information ethics.
                    <br />
                    If you understand German take a look at this paper: <a
                        href="../../www.capurro.de/parrhesia.html">http://www.capurro.de/parrhesia.html</a>
                    <br />
                    where I recall Nietzsche's insight that the next age will be an age of &quot;comparison&quot; before
                    we come to *universal* results. In other words, our commitment at the level of reflection should be,
                    I believe, a patient (!) (long term) work of looking at the *surface* of existing moral systems,
                    their differences (!) and inconsistencies prima facie similarities... If we go too fast in or
                    striving for a (global information) ethics it is like first imaging that the earth is a smooth
                    polished sphere as seen from very far away but as soon as you come near to it, you start considering
                    the *real* state of the surface. This can be done at the micro-level.
                    <br />
                    Take, as an example, the intercultural discussions (Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Western...) on the
                    concept of privacy as discussed in the journal Ethics &amp; IT (2005) Vol. 7

                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At the very best, your definition/inference holds only when singular societal value
                    sets are the criteria for judgment. A general attachment of 'integrity' with morals is
                    improper.&quot; James Rose
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I think we have an important distinction that is good to make having in mind the
                    rapid process of globalization that is going on. It is also relevant for Alex's remarks.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that one of the central issues right now is that of a dialogue. There are
                    importantly different ethical points of view within different societies. There are different
                    judgments dependent on how you set your values/priorities. To me, the most reasonable way to solve
                    such problems is a dialogue. One way or the other human rules of the game are negotiated. I agree
                    with Steven that it is important to find common denominators. If you want a dialogue between
                    different value systems (and what would be the alternative?) it is good to start from what can be
                    identified as common.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence Hinman for example identifies the three most fundamental ethical principles as:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Value human life (not killing the members of your group)
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Taking care of children
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Trust (that establishes the stable rules for the system)
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally the central question is whom you experience as a member of your group -
                    humanity or your best friends.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the need of defining (global) ethics, one might say that one thing happens here,
                    as often in the history of philosophy - philosophy is progressing by leaving parts of its
                    territories to the science. It seems to me good at this stage to make scientific all that may be
                    made scientific, but not more than that (paraphrasing Einstein's advice to make simple all the may
                    be simplified, but not more than that). Part of ethical judgment may be built into expert systems.
                    Simulations may help to predict the consequences of different ethical positions. (Here the practical
                    action - what can be done and how - is on focus).
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of integrity that appears on many different scales - integrity of a state
                    related to other states, integrity of a group among other groups, integrity of an individual in
                    relation to other individuals, groups, etc. What would be the value of those different integrities?
                    The answer is emerging as a result of interaction/dialogue on different levels, and we hopefully are
                    contributing to it.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I like Michael's view:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The word &quot;health&quot; comes from the same root in language as the word
                    &quot;wholeness&quot;. Psychological health comes from integration, and an essential part of this is
                    the process of remembering, i.e., bringing the memory objects into an integrated structure of mind.
                    &quot;
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very general idea, and it can be applied in different value systems and at
                    different levels of granularity.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Best,

                    Integrity does not have to be linked with ethics
                    <br />
