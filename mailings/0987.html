To the session on music:
<br />
<p>Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning to interesting theme on music, I would like to pay attention 
<br />
on physiological aspects of music and their connection with genetic code.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the information viewpoint, living organisms are information 
<br />
essences. They live due to receiving of the genetic information from the 
<br />
ancestors, and they exist to transfer the genetic information to their 
<br />
descendants. In the biological literature it is possible quite often now to 
<br />
meet the statement that living organisms are the texts since a molecular 
<br />
level of their organization. Just from the information-hereditary viewpoint, 
<br />
all living organisms are unified wonderfully: all of them have identical 
<br />
bases of system of genetic coding (from many other possible viewpoints - for 
<br />
example, locomotion, metabolisms, etc -, living organisms have no such 
<br />
unification, they are differ one from another in many cases).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All heritable physiological aspects of living organisms are 
<br />
co-ordinated with basic structures of genetic code (heritable physiological 
<br />
subsystems of organism can’t be transmitted to next biological generations 
<br />
without such agreement with basic mechanisms of genetic coding).
<br />
It’s well known, that special musical forms have essential physiological 
<br />
possibilities to stimulate processes of biological growth, to have therapy 
<br />
effects, etc. So, it can be supposed, that these musical forms are connected 
<br />
(co-ordinated) with genetic coding system structurally. And interesting 
<br />
question is the following: on the base of using of our modern scientific 
<br />
knowledge of structures of genetic code, can we create musical forms which 
<br />
will be else more effective in physiological aspects to use them in the 
<br />
field of mass media, medicine, ergonomics, sport, etc?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own investigations in this direction are connected with new results 
<br />
on genetic code structures. These results are described at the FIS site 
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/recources/papers.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/recources/papers.html</a>  in my article “Genetic 
<br />
Code and the Ancient Chinese “Book of Changes”” . An existence of binary 
<br />
sub-alphabets of genetic code was shown and a biperiodic octet table of 64 
<br />
genetic triplets was constructed by me there.  This genetic biperiodic table 
<br />
was coincided practically with a historical famous table of 64 hexagrams of 
<br />
the Ancient Chinese “Book of Changes””, written several thousands years ago 
<br />
(according to Ancient Chinese statements, the system of this Book is the 
<br />
main archetype of all nature; this system is a base for many branches of 
<br />
Orient medicine, culture, philosophy, etc.). If “physiological music” has a 
<br />
connection with genetic code, the question on its connection with this 
<br />
ancient conception of archetypes is urgent. According to Ancient Chinese 
<br />
statements, “music is that that represents a harmony of sky and earth, a 
<br />
co-ordination of Yin and Yang” (“Lui shi chun tsu”).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these questions are considered in a special paragraph “Genetic 
<br />
code and music» in my book: S.V.Petoukhov “Biperiodic Table of Genetic Code 
<br />
and Number of Protons”, Moscow, 2001, 258 p. (in Russian; information on 
<br />
this book, on its content, etc. in English is at site 
<br />
<a href="../../members.tripod.com/vismath/sg/petoukhov.htm">http://members.tripod.com/vismath/sg/petoukhov.htm</a> ).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that binary sub-alphabets of genetic code and its biperiodic 
<br />
table permit to investigate a language of music more deeply and to create 
<br />
special forms of musical compositions characterized by the most 
<br />
physiological activity (so named “genetic music” or “genomusic”). Perhaps, 
<br />
due to its structural relationship with genetic code, this genetic music 
<br />
will be addressed to Jungian archetypes of people by the shortest route. (By 
<br />
the way, Carl Jung was connoisseur and profound expert of this “Book of 
<br />
Changes”, and the biperiodic table of genetic code has a connection with 
<br />
Jungian archetypes).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theme of “genetic structured” music is a small addition to very 
<br />
interesting works by Juan Roederer è Michael Leyton, discussed on this 
<br />
session. In my opinion, physiological mechanisms and mathematical 
<br />
formalisms, analyzed by them for a theory of musical perception, should be 
<br />
coordinated (adjusted) with the specific structure of genetic code. The 
<br />
biological evolution can be interpreted in a whole as a process of 
<br />
deployment and duplicating of the certain forms of ordering (they can be 
<br />
named as “archetypes”). This thesis has a realization in physiological 
<br />
effective music also.
<br />
<p>With best regards
<br />
Sergei Petoukhov
