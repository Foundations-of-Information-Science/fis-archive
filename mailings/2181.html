                    I hate to keep harping on this, but ...<br><br>
                    I basically agree with Kevin here (note that as with Lazlo's submission,
                    I am trying to find commonalities rather than emphasize more arcane
                    distinctions). I think the discussion is going in a very useful
                    direction, at the proper level of generality to get more towards a
                    general notion of information that is useful in science. Some

                    &quot;Formal&quot; is ambiguous between formal in the mathematical sense
                    and in the sense of form. Both are relevant to a general theory of
                    information, but the latter is the most important. The first is
                    &quot;just mathematics&quot;.<br><br>

                        Particular. Not the type &quot;ribosome.&quot; This sense of
                        &quot;substance&quot; I want to employ here.&nbsp; (The clumsy phrasing
                        in this paragraph is me trying to distinguish this from the Aristotelian
                        notion of substance as an object of logical predication.)
                    </blockquote><br>
                    I note that substance in this sense, which is not so different from the
                    Aristotelean sense, but is closer to the Lockean sense of individual
                    substance, has something that makes it what it is, often called the
                    individual essence. This essence is subject to formal analysis in the
                    first, mathematical sense, but it is also a form in the informal sense.
                    This can be used to bring the two ideas together. I do this in the
                    opening section of my 'Causation is the transfer of information' (1999)
                    <a href="../../www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/causinf.pdf" eudora="autourl">
                        http://www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/causinf.pdf</a>, though the
                    terminology is quite different. Then, using algorithmic information
                    theory I connect this notion of form to information theory. Then I reify
                    the information, and apply it to the physical world including biology
                    through the negentropy notion. This gives a way of talking about causal
                    powers of an object (which include its functional powers. So we have a
                    mathematical analysis of (informal) form, that we can use to discuss
                    causal relation, including in networks. It is also connected directly to
                    the concept of work capacity.<br><br>

                        Now it is a truism that &quot;function&quot; does not inhere in physical
                        objects, but arises from a network of relationships and, perhaps, an
                        interpretive community. We can, in a suitable frame of mind, look at a
                        thing and ignore its function. What are we looking at? That is, take away
                        function from the ribosome, and what is left?&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        &quot;Form&quot;. (The answer seems irresistible.) Now take away form,
                        then what is left? &quot;Substance&quot; maybe? Is that really useful? At
                        first, that sounds like some residual meaningless metaphysical ooze--
                        ousia, in fact. Isn't all of science about form anyway?
                    </blockquote><br>
                    This seems to me to be correct. It should be noted, though, that it is in
                    virtue of form that something can have a function. My recent paper,
                    described above, suggests how to deal with this. Substance doesn't quite
                    drop out, because I found I needed to justify connectivity, as well as,
                    in other papers, the dynamical basis of objects and properties compatible
                    with the informal (but formalized) approach to form.<br><br>

                        seems below scientific discourse, which seeks out form. When we look at
                        something as a scientist, we give it form. It may even become a
                        &quot;system&quot;, with &quot;states.&quot; In computer science,
                        representations of things are the object of study. We might represent an
                        agent, a transaction, or a number, for example. (One thing you tell
                        students in a computer science class is that it is meaningless&nbsp; to
                        speak of the complexity of testing if a number is a prime number; you
                        must instead speak of the complexity of testing whether a representation
                        of a number is a representation of a prime number. Some representations
                        make it trivial; some make it hard.)&nbsp; </blockquote><br>
                    Agreed. My paper was intended to explain away the illusion that substance
                    and its nature was the study of science. I don't think that as scientists
                    we typically give things form (though we may assign it form for the
                    purposes of study). Instead, I think we try to find the form, and what
                    forms underlie it.<br><br>
                    <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">But in _natural_ computation,
                        things are different. Form, representation, system, state-- in some way
                        we must be able to occasionally bracket these out and speak of substance
                        alone. For example, an evolutionary exaptation happens when one part of a
                        biological substance, which served one function, is recruited for
                        another. The semantics is broken, and re-formed. There is some
                        discontinuity in how we can track change in substance by change in formal
                        representation. (I think the philosopher Hilary Putnam hit on one part of
                        this in his arguments against computational functionalism.)&nbsp; I
                        believe these &quot;non-formal properties of information&quot;&nbsp; are
                        at the core of the Conrad tradeoff between computability and amenability
                        to evolution. </blockquote><br>
                    This is interesting. It is noteworthy that in evo-devo it has been found
                    that morphogenetic units can remain constant whereas genetics and
                    function both change. I note, though, that the description of these units
                    in terms of morphology suggests that form is still of the essence. I
                    think that &quot;The semantics is broken, and re-formed.&quot; requires
                    semiotic (or hermeneutic) analysis, but that this can still be understood
                    in terms of the informal forms, and more easily so in terms of a formal
                    representation of this idea.<br>
                    &nbsp;<br>
                    I concur that the Conrad tradeoff depends on the informal aspects of
                    information. Information is richer than the notion of a program provides.
                    Algorithmic information theory, however, is a much richer theory, and can
                    describe more aspects of form, but it still cannot fully capture form on
                    its own. <br><br>
                    <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">A separate observation: Pedro
                        writes of&nbsp; looking at the thinker is his/her &quot;spare time, just
                        when he/she is not acting in that peculiar 'scientific' way.&quot;&nbsp;
                        This evokes Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations 132 in
                        particular), where he points out that the confusions about language that
                        vex us do not occur when language is playing its real-life role (a
                        non-scientific, non-philosophical role-- in Pedro's scientist's
                        &quot;spare time&quot;). The confusions only occur in when language is
                        taken off-line, as it were, disconnected from its role in life, set on a
                        rack ready to be examined. [W's famous negative simile is that of
                        language in this mode being like &quot;an engine idling&quot;.&nbsp; I
                        just looked up the German text and there is no &quot;engine&quot;
                        mentioned directly: it's just &quot;wenn die Sprache
                        leerlau&quot;ft.&quot; Not being a native German speaker, I don't get the
                        nuances, but the notion of language &quot;running on empty&quot; seems
                        engaging...] </blockquote><br>
                    Again I concur, and some recent work of mine is intended to get at this
                    issue without throwing out the baby of formal methods:
                    <a href="../../www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/pragmatist%20pragmatics.pdf">
                        Pragmatist Pragmatics: The functional context of utterances</a> (2005,

                    We use a Peirceaan approach along with some contrary approaches in
                    analytic philosophy to motivate our view, rather than Wittgenstein, who
                    is notoriously cryptic, and not very useful to refer to when trying to
                    attain clarity. (I should not that I admire Wittgenstein, and got an A
                    from Rogers Albritton on my graduate seminar paper for him.)<br><br>
                    <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">The privileging of the real-life
                        notion of information connects back to some remarks by Hans several days
                        ago, on the similarities between trying to define information and trying
                        to define energy. In fact, the art in a beautiful loose definition such
                        as (for example) &quot;energy is the ability to do work&quot; is
                        impressive. It is invariant across different sub-notions of energy (Gibbs
                        free energy, Helmholtz free energy�) and changing understandings of fixed
                        notions of energy (pre-relativistic vs. relativistic, say).&nbsp; And its
                        invocation of work hooks it in both to another set of ordinary-life
                        intuitions (I'm using &quot;energy&quot; pedaling this bicycle) and to
                        another physical concept (work) which can also admit further mathematical
                        elaboration. By so neatly injecting the concept into the web of other
                        physical concepts, it helps one do physics. (Ok- I am not a physicist.)
                        This is at least as valuable as a formal definition that gives precise
                        necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be called
                        &quot;energy.&quot; Accordingly, I am a great appreciator of definitions
                        of information such as &quot;reduction in uncertainty&quot; or
                        &quot;difference that makes a difference.&quot; They tie this plural
                        concept into a scientifically useful semantic web. If one wishes to
                        charge into the still-dark territory of &quot;non-formal&quot;
                        information, it is definitions like these that will light the
