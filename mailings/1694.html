Dear Fis discussants,
<br />
<p>In first reply to the opening message of this session, Aleks said that he is 
<br />
examining the consilience not of hypotheses but of scientific tools (e.g. 
<br />
calculus) and patterns.  I thank Aleks for making this clear.  Most of the 
<br />
subsequent dissussion has been about the latter, as well about 
<br />
interdisciplinarity.  So, there are two notions of consilience on the table. 
<br />
The first is Whewell's notion of consilience, which is about the consilience 
<br />
achieved by scientific hypotheses or theories.  The second is a broader 
<br />
notion of consilience, which concerns the similarity of concepts, 
<br />
mathematical techniques, or patterns of explanation across disciplines.  Let 
<br />
me refer to the latter as Wilsonian consilience, although I'm not sure 
<br />
whether the labels fits because I haven't read Wilson's book.  I find the 
<br />
topic interesting, and I have followed the discussion with great 
<br />
concentration.  Unfortunately, it is not something I have thought a lot 
<br />
about in the past.
<br />
<p>If interdisciplinarity is broadened to include the interactions between 
<br />
scientists and philosophers, then this is definitely a subject that also 
<br />
interests me greatly, and one that I am able to talk about because I have a 
<br />
dual education in science and philosophy.  [I began my education in science 
<br />
and mathematics, eventually holding a post-doc in the mathematics and 
<br />
statistics department at Monash University.  I also did an undergraduate in 
<br />
the arts and humanities, eventually proceeding to the PhD level in 
<br />
philosophy (Western Ontario), finally to become a Professor of Philosophy at 
<br />
UW-Madison.]
<br />
<p>As it happens, I spend more time talking to scientists (mostly mathematical 
<br />
psychologists, biologists, statisticians, economists, and applied 
<br />
mathematicians) than I do talking to philosophers.  Over the years, I've 
<br />
been struck by the fact that each discipline tends to invent its own 
<br />
vocabulary.  Thus, philosophers of science often talk about science in a way 
<br />
that few scientists understand, and vice versa (the word 'model' is a case 
<br />
in point--philosophers often use the term in the sense of model theory in 
<br />
mathematics).  But I have also observed simple miscommunications between 
<br />
scientific disciplines that study the some topic, such as decision making, 
<br />
inductive inference, or prediction.  For example, mathematicians talk about 
<br />
predicting a dependent variable from the values of a set of independent 
<br />
variables, whereas psychologists talk about predicting a criterion from a 
<br />
set of cues (terminology that arises out of theories of perception).
<br />
<p>There are cases in which one discipline takes a concept that has a well 
<br />
established meaning, such as 'relativity' in physics, and applies it or 
<br />
extends it to another discipline.  But on the other side of the same coin, 
<br />
there are many cases in which a discipline re-invents the 'wheel'.  The use 
<br />
of the terms 'cue' and 'criterion' is a case in point.  This is not a source 
<br />
of confusion so much as a complete barrier to communication.  Several 
<br />
disciplines fail to learn from each other even though they have a common 
<br />
topic of interest. This is a *failure* of consilience (in the Wilsonian 
<br />
sense), where there ought to be consilience.
<br />
<p>In sum, interdisciplinary communication is frequently stifled by false 
<br />
consiliences (where the same word is used to refer to different things) and 
<br />
by failures of consilience (where different words are used to refer to the 
<br />
same thing).  These are separate phenomena.  I'd be interested to hear about 
<br />
the difficulties that people in this group have had in understanding or 
<br />
communicating with philosophers of science.  In my opinion, philosophers of 
<br />
science need to try harder to communicate with scientists, because this is 
<br />
clearly a case in which different disciplines are interested in the same 
<br />
thing, namely science.
<br />
<p>I'd also like to hear more about failures of interdisciplinary consilience 
<br />
within the sciences. (Please remember to explain the examples in enough 
<br />
detail so that someone without an intimate knowledge of the sciences in 
<br />
question may get the gist of it).
<br />
<p>Cordially,
<br />
Malcolm Forster
