Hi Group,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It is however not so strange (well known from human history :) ) how it is
<br />
hard for human mind to give up its position as the only &quot;machine&quot; able to
<br />
process information and uncover its meaning... There were many examples in
<br />
history when switching from the human-centered attitudes and theories had to
<br />
be (painfully) experienced otherwise evolution of science and emergence of
<br />
new meaningful and correct knowledge would have been questionable indeed. So
<br />
&nbsp;we are not a centre of the Universe anymore, we are not the only living
<br />
beings with brains, having social life, experiencing feelings and gaining
<br />
general experience about our environment. Neither live beings are the only
<br />
type of systems able to process information. Now it seems that we are again
<br />
in such a painful point of bifurcation when speaking about the meaning and
<br />
hopefully  not so painful in regard to the non-anthropocentric notion of
<br />
information. Why should we expect that information is meaningful only for
<br />
humans ? There are many examples of signs that are meaningless to our mind
<br />
but evidently has a meaning in other contexts. Song of a bird, genetic code
<br />
in nature, even binary code in computers created by us to bear meaning
<br />
within machine (but not our mind) are good examples. Should we speak about
<br />
correctness instead ? But it is the meaning that can be correct or not,
<br />
while meaning itself being a property of information... Genetic code. If it
<br />
is in a wrong context (e.g. you try to analyze genetic sequences in your
<br />
mind) then it will not be used to produce any protein it carries a meaning
<br />
for. If it is incorrect then it still will be processed but with mistakes -
<br />
mutations. But then why do our minds analyze it at all ? Because of it's
<br />
meaning within a cell. In this case it is meaningful for our minds just
<br />
because it is meaningful for the cell and not vice versa. Our mind just
<br />
tries to explore the meaning and the context of genes.  Nor mind is a
<br />
context for genetic information as it does not participate in DNR
<br />
replication, neither genes work correctly just because we assigned a meaning
<br />
for them in our heads. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Can absolutely meaningless information (if it is information) exist at all ?
<br />
In the world of chemical reactions catalysers change a flow of processes not
<br />
participating in them directly, but through certain structural interactions
<br />
that can be described as information matching context and therefore
<br />
meaningful. You can not describe catalysis in terms of chemical reaction or
<br />
transfer of energy. But the process very much reminds meaning-context
<br />
coupling. 
<br />
&nbsp;If something is meaningless for somebody then it well might carry a at
<br />
least some meaning for someone else, or for example enzymes DNA polymerases
<br />
are meaningless in processes of carbohydrate metabolism within a cell but
<br />
they are vital when repairing defected DNA. In similar way a key from my
<br />
doors does not necessarily suits lock in doors of my neighbor, etc... Then
<br />
what is meaningless ? Here some examples from nature on &quot;the meaningless&quot;:
<br />
frogs do not see (perceive) objects that do not move because if somebody
<br />
does not move then it is meaningless to a frog (nor an enemy neither prey)..
<br />
&nbsp;Human eyes do not see infrared or ultraviolet radiation and do not perceive
<br />
radio frequency waves because we would be overloaded with huge amounts of
<br />
information that is meaningless for our daily activities and survival... 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Meaning may be responsible for many  well known phenomena generalized by a
<br />
term of retro-causality.  The best examples available are from quantum
<br />
world: light quanta can exist only in space between two objects, if there is
<br />
nothing to be aimed at - light will not be emitted. One may also consider
<br />
experiment of diffraction where every single photon &quot;knows&quot; where others go
<br />
to choose its unique way and finally interact with the totality of others to
<br />
produce well known wavy patterns on a screen... Something like this also
<br />
emerges in our macro-world when we start thinking about systems in terms of
<br />
information theory, meaning, purpose, context... If there is a purpose there
<br />
will be an actor aimed at it.  Look how precisely protein macromolecules
<br />
folds into their secondary, tertiary structures (structure as information)
<br />
just to fit an object they have to interact (function=meaning) with
<br />
(purpose)... What is more interesting they are not folded by an external
<br />
actor - they fold by themselves following laws and internal forces of
<br />
molecular interaction responding to conditions (signals) from their
<br />
environment. But the result matches a function (meaning) of this structure
<br />
within the entire system (context).  This proves bidirectional (top-down &amp;
<br />
down-top) evolution and emergence of system hierarchies as earlier discussed
<br />
in this list.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But there is even more fun to this. It seems that information frequently
<br />
(always ?..) has several layers of meaning targeted at different &quot;listeners&quot;
<br />
i.e. same events/structures are meaningful in different contexts. For
<br />
example when you read those words and sentences of this message you can
<br />
understand my thoughts, however your brain first analyses each symbol
<br />
(letter) and joins it in to words without your conscious participation. But
<br />
prior to being able to perceive letters yet another part of your brain has
<br />
to decode a signal from your eyes which consists of numerous signals
<br />
produced by different kinds of cells sensitive to light or color that are
<br />
located in retina. In fact brain is decoding, comparing and merging two
<br />
different sets of signals in order to construct a stereo-view of
<br />
surroundings, feel shape of objects, and so on... Now lets look at yet
<br />
another systems participating in this process- the Internet, computers.
<br />
Letters are meaningful for us, but what is meaningful for the Internet is
<br />
the SMTP communication protocol (in case of e-mail messages). Computer
<br />
interacts with the meaning only as binary representation of letters (ASCII
<br />
code) but it does not care about letters themselves... And more levels of
<br />
meaning can be identified here. If at least one of them failed nobody would
<br />
be able to read this message and some layers of meaning would be lost... So
<br />
when we hear a sound of a thunderstorm we &quot;are supposed&quot; to respond to this
<br />
(message) adequately and ensure safety of our home and flesh ;-). If it was
<br />
meaningless we wouldn't hear it. If  meaningless information can participate
<br />
in generation of meaningful information, then is it truly meaningless  ? Are
<br />
there any opinions on this (multiple layers of meaning) ?..
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Best regards
<br />
&nbsp;Viktoras
