May scientific researchers help humans to be better aware of the kind 
<br />
of reality that humans have, though unconsciously,  built. May 
<br />
scientific research help humans to organize actions that may help our 
<br />
species to survive longer?
<br />
<p>Time is getting shorter and shorter

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It is indeed a sad reality that intuition in action is not always enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to lead to correct action. That's the point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In fact --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Osama Bin Laden does not adhere to the mechanistic world view either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;He and his friend Omar would say that their actions were guided by intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and divine inspiration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Clearly that by itself is not enough. It is obvious that it has its limits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Those who wish to rely more on intuition logically need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;understand and assess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;those limits, in order to avoid going off the deep end.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we were given all the facts concerning 911 maybe we would be able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to make a better judgement about whether or not his intuition was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wrong or right. But even if his intuition was correct, America was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not correct by invading another country without a declaration of war 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by congress. What Bush did is bypass the law. This war was not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fought under the law, and no evidence either way will change that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is very difficult sometimes to tell intuition apart from thinking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we are right because we think we are right, or whatever, so I always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look for second opinions so to speak. Bush should have paid more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attention to the space craft showering down on his head right after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his big speech. But my point was that I don't think he was relying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on intuition at all, I think he had a clear cut plan all figured out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and it isn't what he says it is. I don't think he paid any attention 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to his intuition at all. Remember when you said we should/could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume he is sincere? While it is noble of you to assume that, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't think he ever was sincere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is a book of all the items Iraq purchased before the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sanctions. It is the size of a phone book, the article said. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shows anthrax being shipped from a building just two blocks away 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from a military installation. Bush knows what he had because we sold 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it to him.

<p><p>John Collier  (collierj&#64;nu.ac.za) used to quote
<br />
<p>I've found the link between apes and civilised men - it's us.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Konrad Lorenz
<br />
<p><p>Intuition in Action and Divine Inspiration are simply words that 
<br />
intend to justify the civilizing trends that keep changing our 
<br />
magnificent World.  It is the idealized homosphere that most 
<br />
researchers, experts and scholars are interested to deal with.  The 
<br />
World during the last century until today has changed a lot - less 
<br />
for better and a lot more for worse - but allowing for a gross 
<br />
simplification the improvements are rarely due to scientific 
<br />
knowledge, nor to technological and methodological innovations.
<br />
<p>The prevailing civilization is the culmination of the adventure that 
<br />
started around 6 millennia ago.
<br />
<p>&quot;...Reason does not automatically lead to a solution of the human 
<br />
problem and, by and large , has little influence in the sanguinary 
<br />
course of human history, was the disappointing discovery of our time&quot; 
<br />
Bertalanffy 1967
<br />
<p>In the year 2003 &quot;The biggest threat to your home, your health, your 
<br />
family, your freedom and your future now come from America. America 
<br />
is a real and present danger: a very real and very serious threat to 
<br />
world peace. ... Most Americans think they are fighting terrorists. 
<br />
...&quot;
<br />
<p>Vernon Coleman has written &quot;Rogue Nation&quot; for helping to comprehend 
<br />
how the world has become increasingly dangerous being managed by 
<br />
means of irresponsible decision-making supported by adaptable masses 
<br />
through an increasing corrupted opportunism leading to nowhere.
<br />
<p>* It is a popular misconception that America declared war on Germany. 
<br />
The Americans only came into World War II because Germany declared 
<br />
war on them (Page 20)
<br />
<p>* In the 111 years between 1890 and 2001, the USA began 134 wars 
<br />
around the world. The wars were started to 'protect American 
<br />
interests overseas'(Page 163)
<br />
<p>* The USA has 30,000 tons of chemical weapons. And the USA has 
<br />
consistently refused to support any UN initiative that would ban the 
<br />
development of biological and chemical weapons (Page 184)
<br />
<p>* The Americans have withdrawn from the Geneva Convention (Page 156).
<br />
<p>* America has introduced a first strike policy --giving itself the 
<br />
right to start wars whenever it feels like it (Page 159)
<br />
<p>* The USA is the only country in the world to have ever used nuclear 
<br />
and chemical weapons (Page 99)
<br />
<p>* America has violated nuclear weapons treaties (Page 72)
<br />
<p>* Find out why a permanent war has now become a common necessity (Page 84)
<br />
<p>* Learn why American arms factories manufacture land-mines 
<br />
specifically intended to maim small children (Page 72)
