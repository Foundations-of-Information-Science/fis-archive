<p>
Thank you all for an active and interesting forum. I enjoyed it.
<br />
<p><p><p>I see the concept of consilience is alive and well.  People tend to 
<br />
recognize it as an important concept, and some people know what it means. 
<br />
At least to them.  The problem is that word has been understood in different 
<br />
ways by different people from the very first day it was coined.  In this 
<br />
closing message, I will describe my own perception of how William Whewell's 
<br />
concept was forever altered by John Stuart Mill and Charles Peirce.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>Everyone recognizes that the greatest examples of scientific induction are 
<br />
not like the examples of induction that Aristotle and Hume discussed:  All 
<br />
observed billiard balls have moved when struck; therefore all billiard balls 
<br />
will move when struck.  This simple-minded pattern of inductive inference, 
<br />
known as simple enumerative induction, does not fit the famous examples such 
<br />
as Newton's argument for universal gravitation or Perrin's argument for the 
<br />
existence of atoms.  The better examples have the noticeable feature that 
<br />
the billiard ball example lacks:  the conclusion of the inference postulates 
<br />
the existence of something new, gravity, or atoms; something not mentioned 
<br />
in the statement of the evidence that is cited in favor of the conclusion. 
<br />
Nowadays, philosophers refer to these inferences as abductions (a word 
<br />
coined by Peirce) or inferences to the best explanation.
<br />
<p><p><p>The problem with inferences to the best explanation is that this notion is 
<br />
mysterious until we are told what counts as an explanation, and what makes 
<br />
one explanation better than another.  The trouble is that different people 
<br />
have different intuitions about what is explanatory.  Cartesians refused to 
<br />
accept Newton's theory was explanatory because it postulated instantaneous 
<br />
action-at-a-distance.  Today, many people refuse to say that quantum 
<br />
mechanics is explanatory because it is provably inconsistent with common 
<br />
cause explanation; that is, the postulation of local hidden variables.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>Mill's response to Whewell was sensible on the surface.  He wanted to 
<br />
understand everything in terms of deduction, for this is a precise notion. 
<br />
So, for him inference to the best explanation (if he had used that term) 
<br />
would come down to deductive subsumption under general laws.  Reconsider my 
<br />
stock example.   Let K stand for Kepler's laws applied to the moon, G be 
<br />
Galileo's law projectile motion, and let N be the simple Newtonian model 
<br />
that unifies these two phenomena by postulating the existence of gravity. 
<br />
Mill's idea is that N is the better explanation than the conjunction K&amp;G 
<br />
because K and G are deductively subsumed under N.  That is, N is a simpler 
<br />
and more general law, and N entails K and N entails G.  Unfortunately, it is 
<br />
not the concept of deduction that is doing the work here.  For K&amp;G is more 
<br />
general than either K or G, and K&amp;G entails K and K&amp;G entails G.  The only 
<br />
thing that differentiates N from K&amp;G is the idea that N is &quot;simpler and more 
<br />
fundamental&quot;.  But what does that mean?  All Mill has done is to replace one 
<br />
mystery by another.
<br />
<p><p><p>The subsumption under general laws may be a necessary part of inference to 
<br />
the best explanation.  The objection is that it is not sufficient.  We need 
<br />
to say more.  I think it is ironic that this something extra is exactly what 
<br />
Whewell referred to as the consilience of inductions.  Philosophers since 
<br />
Whewell have attempted to demystify Whewell's consilience of inductions by 
<br />
either ignoring it or by replacing it with something that is either 
<br />
inaccurate or too vague (or both).  While I don't deny that Whewell's 
<br />
discussion of consilience is hard to understand in precise terms, it is 
<br />
still be best discussion of the concept that exists today.  If you think 
<br />
there's something right about Whewell's idea, then you should study Whewell. 
<br />
The following is an excellent collection of Whewell's writings on scientific 
<br />
method:
<br />
<p><p><p>Butts, Robert E. (ed.) (1989). William Whewell: Theory of Scientific Method. 
<br />
Hackett Publishing Company, Indianapolis/Cambridge.
<br />
<p>I recommend you begin with Whewell's essay &quot;On the Fundamental Antithesis of 
<br />
Philosophy&quot; and then study Chapter III, which contains excerpts from Whewell's 
<br />
Novum Organon Renovatum.  Finally, Whewell's essay &quot;Newton&quot; is well worth 
<br />
reading.
<br />
<p><p><p>A word of caution though.  Whewell was an eminent historian of science, and 
<br />
in his philosophical writings he presupposes that you understand the 
<br />
scientific examples in his terms.  If you don't, then you will find yourself 
<br />
in the same position as Mill and Peirce.  Then, I predict that the cycle of 
<br />
misunderstanding will continue.
<br />
<p><p><p>Cordially yours,
<br />
