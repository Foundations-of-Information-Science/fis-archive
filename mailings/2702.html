                <p>
                    Let me provide my entry in this very interesting kickoff. Wondering about
                    <br />
                    the nature of complexity is a great starting issue, I think.
                    <br />
                <p>A reminder of where I am coming from: I believe that we will soon begin
                    <br />
                    serious work on creating a new science that leverages information as a
                    <br />
                    primitive and emergent behavior as a mechanism or effect. It will be a
                    <br />
                    universal science, covering chemistry and physics as well as social
                    <br />
                    behavior but leverage (human) notions of introspection.
                    <br />
                <p>I say this, Joe, so you know where I am coming from, and why I chose to
                    <br />
                    complicate the discussion by wondering about how complexity would fit into
                    <br />
                    such a framework.
                    <br />
                <p>Joe suggests that we look at what we mean by complexity, and he suggests
                    <br />
                    three approaches: number of different elements, the number of different
                    <br />
                    ways that they are organized (which I assume includes the number of nodes
                    <br />
                    that are related to others), or the increased &quot;capability&quot; of structure (or
                    <br />
                    network). Stanley adds the idea of hierarchy which is a way of structuring
                    <br />
                    causality. Igor adds a cognitive aspect, internal structure of reflexivity
                    <br />
                    and assumes that is unique to human systems. Loet adds that old standby:
                    <br />
                    entropy.
                    <br />
                <p>Rather than speculate on whether these are &quot;they ways things are,&quot; I would
                    <br />
                    like to propose a different approach. Let's assume that all these
                    <br />
                    definitions are elective, that we can choose our definitions of complexity
                    <br />
                    and subsequently the associated metrics. That's fair enough. Even if you
                    <br />
                    are a realist, you can accept that the abstractions we choose to model the
                    <br />
                    world with can be chosen, or even designed.
                    <br />
                <p>So if we were going to invent a new science. And it was going to apply at
                    <br />
                    the social level as well as, say the chemical and biological...
                    <br />
                <p>And it was going to apply to synthetic systems as well as natural systems
                    <br />
                    (allowing that you may consider human systems partly synthetic)...
                    <br />
                <p>And it was going to make sense &quot;inside&quot; a system as well as outside a
                    <br />
                    system looking in...
                    <br />
                <p>Given all that (which I suppose to be the FIS agenda) what would the notion
                    <br />
                    of complexity look like?
                    <br />
                <p>I suppose it wouldn't be quantitative in its most natural form. I suppose
                    <br />
                    it would be a matter of causal relationships in a network sense. I suppose
                    <br />
                    the relationships would be defined in terms of information somehow. (You
                    <br />
                    see my own bias in assuming causality here as the basic mechanism - but if
                    <br />
                    science is anything it is predictive models of cause and effect and only
                    <br />
                    secondarily measurement.)
                    <br />
                <p>I further suppose that hierarchies could be found but only by interpretive
                    <br />
                    filters - and that these would be easier to justify in the human case.
                    <br />
                <p>And here is a speculation I have made before here: I suppose that there is
                    <br />
                    an upper limit on the complexity that any system can maintain before it
                    <br />
                    creates a new level of abstractions in creating a new layer. So chemistry
                    <br />
                    breeds biology as a way of managing complexity. Human systems breed deities
                    <br />
                    for the same reason.
                    <br />
                <p>And another speculation: why should the mechanics of the model be separate
                    <br />
                    from the model? If the stuff of our new science is information and causal
                    <br />
                    relationships, is not there a complexity of the model as well? Does not it
                    <br />
                    have emergent behavior as well? Why should science be fixed dogma, except
                    <br />
                    to help us pretend the explanations are simple, numeric, static and involve
                    <br />
                    mystical things like fields, and conditional states?
                    <br />
                <p>Just wondering. Complexity is a good place to start in my mind, I repeat.
                    <br />
