<p>
I apologize in advance for possible duplication of this message
<br />
<p>*International Federation for Systems Research
<br />
<p>I encourage myself to notice, read and try to comprehend, through 
<br />
information diffused by various means, some more of the shocking 
<br />
events happening everyday all over the world. Perhaps I am too much 
<br />
afraid of what has been the routine during centuries, as I am getting 
<br />
older every day. Anyhow, I dare to consider these events the 
<br />
manifestation of the worst crisis ever faced by humankind, though 
<br />
most people do not recognize it under the assumption that every 
<br />
person may individually organize his/her survival on his/her own 
<br />
whatever could be the social, economic, cultural circumstances or 
<br />
difficulties. I wish, I might be optimist enough or at least to 
<br />
believe that sooner or later every trouble will disappear assuming 
<br />
that somebody, somewhere is taking care of the human world. Instead I 
<br />
remain worried day after day searching hopeless to get a holistic 
<br />
appraisal of the whole human affair, which I dare to believe is 
<br />
indispensable to identify how I might contribute consistently to 
<br />
overcome critical happenings and contingencies. Illusory perhaps, but 
<br />
I can neither prove myself whether it is a wrong or a right 
<br />
assumption. In addition, though pretty soon I realize that my 
<br />
attempts to get a holistic appraisal of this crisis are quite 
<br />
restricted by my personal possibilities, my thinking remains every 
<br />
day increasingly disrupted after realizing that our magnificent 
<br />
civilization has been always a growing fallacy.
<br />
<p>Certainly, it could not be denied the evidence of the enormous 
<br />
potentiality of human capabilities - intellectual and manual work - 
<br />
shown along around six millennia. Therefore, while trying to 
<br />
comprehend how could come into being the global tragedy that faces 
<br />
humankind at present, it becomes evidently and even urgently 
<br />
necessary to identify its causes as the perspective for Homo sapiens 
<br />
sapiens in the very near future appears to be rather catastrophic. It 
<br />
is also indispensable to recognize that the situation of humankind in 
<br />
the year 2006 is the culmination of a contradictory trajectory.
<br />
<p>When became contradictory the human perspective?
<br />
<p>The problem that faces today the human species is not in fact a 
<br />
recent difficulty as it has been registered in the history of various 
<br />
societies during the last six millennia that one or another HOLOCAUST 
<br />
would happen due to the inconsistent performance of humans. 
<br />
Historically, the assumed most advanced societies learnt soon to make 
<br />
increasingly feasible the utilitarian opportunism inherent to human 
<br />
thinking in order to take unilateral advantage of everything 
<br />
perceived in the terrestrial surroundings. In comparison to actions 
<br />
carried out for exploiting the terrestrial circumstances very, very 
<br />
few attempts have been successfully accomplished about the commitment 
<br />
of humans learning to recognize their individual and collective 
<br />
duties on Earth. Instead we have been always very busy fighting for 
<br />
our rights, including those that may allow a person individually to 
<br />
perform idiotically, hypocritically, cynically,... till learning to 
<br />
behave continuously sarcastically as most living souls placed in 
<br />
powerful positions learn quite easily to develop.
<br />
<p>How could this distorted conduct of humans institutionalized?
<br />
<p>We have learnt that our intelligence arose from evolutionary forces.
<br />
<p>Should we assume that something seriously wrong happened ?
<br />
<p>It has just happened that our magnificent (?) civilization(s) 
<br />
has(have) evolved in accordance with the interests, requirements and 
<br />
wishes of the enlightened members of numerous &quot;high&quot; societies 
<br />
constituted everywhere.
<br />
<p>Based on some archeological and historical evidences it is relatively 
<br />
well known that most humans everywhere have been employed exclusively 
<br />
as human resources (slaves, serfs, soldiers, lackeys, servants, 
<br />
workers, employees, artists, scientists, teachers,...) needed for 
<br />
maintaining the dynamics of one or another of the numerous &quot;high&quot; 
<br />
societies constituted. Our &quot;grandiose&quot; civilizing efforts have been 
<br />
organized during relatively recent millennia, when some leaders 
<br />
encouraged people to recognize as a feasible perspective to settle 
<br />
down here or there. Through the interpretation of archeological 
<br />
findings and relatively biased arguments written as historical 
<br />
accounts and documents, it is evidently undeniable that billions of 
<br />
people have played the role of human resources employed for creating 
<br />
and maintaining facilities that presumably will enjoy privileged 
<br />
human specimens.
<br />
<p>Meanwhile every &quot;high&quot; society is constituted and maintained by real 
<br />
parasites who accumulate money, properties and power for the sake of 
<br />
massive augmentation by means of colonization, terrorism, war, unjust 
<br />
trade, apartheid, corruption, state robbery, exhaustive 
<br />
exploitation...
<br />
<p>What has become increasingly evident is the cynical performance of 
<br />
one or another of these abhorrent societies, managed by decision 
<br />
makers engaged in modernizing systematically selfish procedures with 
<br />
the work carried out by scientists, technologists, engineers, 
<br />
artists, educators, in order to make more productive, efficient, 
<br />
effective,... their civilizing concerns.
<br />
<p>Meanwhile among the masses (billions today) what increases is 
<br />
unemployment, poverty, misery, hunger, starvation, criminality, 
<br />
disease,... and also opportunistic attempts for making monetary 
<br />
profits whatever the means.
<br />
<p>It appears today rather impossible to stop the arrival of 
<br />
apocalyptical events generated by the narrow minded and shortsighted 
<br />
decision making that has prevailed during the last centuries, 
<br />
cynically supported today by the increasing opportunism of most 
<br />
governments and comprise the United Nations Organization.
<br />
<p>However tragic the perspective I still dare to imagine that the 
<br />
scientific community may wake up and save Homo sapiens sapiens from 
<br />
being extinct.
<br />
<p>(It will continue)
<br />
<p>personal appraisal of elohimjl
