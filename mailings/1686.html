Subj: [Fis]: Re: CONSILIENCE: When separate inductions jump together
<br />
<p>Dear Malcolm, dear FISers,
<br />
<p>You ask:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another question that has been raised is whether the attempt to apply the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same concept, such as 'entropy' across various disciplines counts as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consilience; and if not, why not.  Obviously, there is a danger in being too 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liberal about what counts as a consilience....
</em><br />
<p>When Boltzmann proposed a model to compute the Clausius entropy,
<br />
he created a bridge between two worlds: the &quot;micro&quot; and the &quot;macro&quot;
<br />
Undoubtly this was a major victory of science. It linked also
<br />
two areas of science, relatively to the approximate classification
<br />
of disciplines in vigor at the end of the 19th century. Now the
<br />
intersection of the two disciplines is recognized as a full
<br />
subdiscipline: statistical mechanics (it's a fun that the name
<br />
evokes statistics and mechanics but not chemistry). The main
<br />
point here about entropy is that we refer to only one concept:
<br />
a measurable parameter, and its calculation from a physical model.
<br />
The situation is different after 1948, when Shannon picked
<br />
the entropy word and used it in communication sciences.
<br />
Despite the formal similarity in the equations, entropy
<br />
exists now as a mathematical concept outside any reference to
<br />
thermodynamics (except historically). E.g. you can compute
<br />
the entropy of some distribution you like, even if it makes
<br />
sense in a context far from thermodynamics or statistical
<br />
mechanics. Going back to the consilience viewed by Whewell,
<br />
or by Wilson, I would agree with you, Malcolm, that there is
<br />
a danger to count entropy as an example of consilience:
<br />
owing from what I have read about the term (but I am not an
<br />
expert), it seems abusive to exhibit an example of consilience
<br />
when a (meaningless) formal analogy is found somewhere.
<br />
Ihe historical motivation of Shannon to choose the term entropy
<br />
is neglected here: it adds confusion to the debate.
<br />
<p>Let me add the following about the situation in France, and
<br />
please tell me if it is different in other countries.
<br />
The need to classify things is commonly encountered in sciences.
<br />
and also outside sciences. On the other hand, many scientists
<br />
claim that the vertical division between scientific areas is
<br />
harmful. Now, I observe that it is difficult to access to
<br />
the A positions such as full Professor or Director of Research
<br />
(this is the French equivalent of full Professor for researchers)
<br />
when your work is pluridisciplinary, and reaching the highest
<br />
grades available to the &quot;A&quot; scientist needs first to be clearly
<br />
classified in a well known and easily recognized area: this is
<br />
called the &quot;easy identifiability criterion&quot;.
<br />
In other words, you should both tell that you are pluridisciplinary
<br />
and absolutely avoid to do a pluridisciplinary work.
<br />
A well known example of that (still in France) is people working
<br />
on chemical data banks (involves graph theory, algorithmic,...)
<br />
The computer sciences and communication sciences are well
<br />
recognized, and most areas of chemistry too, but chemists working
<br />
on data banks fall most time in organic chemistry sections. It means
<br />
that some works involving a high part of informatics are evaluated
<br />
by people working on synthesis of some natural product in
<br />
20 or 30 steps. Of course organicians like data banks, but
<br />
when a decision is needed, they support primarily organic
<br />
chemistry projects, because they act in an organic chemistry section.
<br />
In such situations, how could we expect progress in
<br />
interdisciplinary fields: funds are never attributed to
<br />
to scientists considered as being &quot;marginal&quot;.
<br />
The situation is going worse and worse: the trend is to support
<br />
only some large research groups working on a limited number of
<br />
topics of industrial importance, eliminating progressively
<br />
the smallest research groups. This phenomenon seems to extend soon
<br />
at the European level. Most of the french scientific community
<br />
do not approve this evolution. But the decision power is rather
<br />
elsewhere.
<br />
<p>People like what looks familiar. Progress processes by neighbouring,
<br />
not by jumps. I heard that De Brooglie presented his work first to
<br />
chemists, and was not welcome...
