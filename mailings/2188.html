                            I understand your concerns but how else are we to proceed?&nbsp;
                            Shannon's model is not nullified but it does not appear to characterize
                            all that we would wish it to.&nbsp; I am not asking for a full rewrite I
                            am simply observing that we need to extend information theory into the
                            area where we lack rigor - where the model seemingly needs to be
                            extended.&nbsp; I am simply contending that we cannot deal with the
                            notion of information in isolation.<br><br>
                            In my view we need to develop two new models that complement current
                            physical theory with the mathematical rigor of Shannon: a theory of
                            organism (how sentient entities come to be) and a theory of semeiotics
                            (how sentient entities operate) - where semeiotics includes a theory of
                            communication and what I will call &quot;memeiosis&quot; which describes
                            the exchange of &quot;information&quot; and the development of concepts
                            by individuals in groups of sentient entities.&nbsp; Done rigorously,
                            this is inevitably a mathematical theory of meaning as you
                            suggest.</font>
                    </blockquote><br>
                    For reasons why I doubt that a mathematical theory of meaning is
                    impossible, see <font face="Times New Roman, Times" size=4><b>Pragmatist
                            Pragmatics: The functional context of utterances, </b></font>forthcoming
                    in <i>Philosophica</i>. Konrad Talmont-Kaminski and I argue that a formal
                    pragmatics is impossible, and that a theory of meaning requires
                    pragmatics, therefore a formal theory of meaning is impossible. However
                    once we have the meaning of a communication fixed, we can then use formal
                    methods that are well known. The argument uses Barwise and Seligman's
                    version of information flow, and draws on work in formal pragmatics by
                    Montague, Kaplan and Stalnaker, situation semantics of Barwise and Perry,
                    and insights from Peirce. There is a draft version at

                            definition of what you mean by &quot;information systems.&quot;&nbsp;
                            From my point of view computational models do not adequately account for

                    Nor for living systems in general if Robert Rosen's arguments in <i>Life
                        Itself</i> are correct. He shows rigorously how a system can fail to be
                    computable or mechanical in the sense of a terminating (Knuth) algorithm.
                    Henri Atlan has made similar arguments, to the effect that certain
                    molecular systems on which living systems depend have infinite
                    &quot;sophistication&quot;, which I take to be equivalent to Bennett's
                    logical depth.<br><br>
                    Interestingly, there is a review article from Science on the early stages
                    of sea urchin development that claims that there are emergent properties
                    of the developmental system (not reducible to the parts of the regulatory
                    network) at early stages. I have not been able to evaluate this claim
                    myself. The article is <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>A Genomic

                                of the word information: a group of definitions akin to Shannon's
                                mathematical definition and a group of definitions which define
                                information as &quot;what in-forms&quot; a system (Varela). In the latter
                                case, the system invests some meaning in the information or, more
                                generally, positions the information in its framework. Perhaps, one could
                                use the word &quot;observed information&quot; for this, while the
                                Shannon-information remains &quot;expected
                                information.&quot;</font>

                    Again, for an explanation of how these two ideas can be brought together
                    and be used as the core for at least four philosophically current

                                the mathematical character which frees us from specific semantics. When I
                                read your mailings, for example, it seems that I have to buy a whole
                                philosophy if I wish to understand it. From my perspective, this
                                philosophy sounds like a meta-biology (unlike a meta-physics). Biological
                                systems theory has helped us enormously in understanding how information
                                can be stored into information systems and thus provided with meaning (by
                                codification along the system's own axis). Social and psychic systems,
                                however, can entertain (and perhaps communicate) horizons of meaning.
                                Thus, they obviously have more degrees of freedom for processing
                                information and meaning than biological systems (while the latter are
                                also embodied?). </font>

                    I am not at all sure that the latter have more degrees of freedom. The
                    difference seems to me to be much more in terms of response time and
                    extent (thought is faster than evolution, culture expands spatial extent,
                    as does communication in general). A number of distinctions need to be
                    made to sort this out, but Cliff Hooker and I made them in

                                seems to me that we need a kind of mathematical theory of meaning. How
                                can meaning be defined in the abstract, yet without giving it meaning
                                with reference to any body of knowledge other than the abstract one which
                                is contained, for example, in the mathematical theory of communication
                                and its elaboration into non-linear dynamics? Let me make a first
                                proposal: expected information can only be provided with meaning by
                                information systems. I know that this circular definition begs the
                                question, but it is only meant as a first step.

                        is basically Peircean, but with more modern formalism. If you understand
                        semiotics, then you understand why a formal and complete theory of
                        meaning is impossible. It is possible, however, to link up a formal but

                        else have been shown to have no formal and complete solution. I mention
                        my own papers mostly because I have taken a lot of trouble to review
                        these issues. Everyone on the fis list should read Heinz von Foerster's
