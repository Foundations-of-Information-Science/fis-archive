Dear Michel and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Before attempting a response to the 'order/disorder' theme you have 
<br />
proposed us, let me terminate the speculations on entropy/temperature I 
<br />
started last days. Actually both reflections might be quite close, as the 
<br />
proposal to leave aside the 'entropy as disorder' interpretation should 
<br />
imply efforts  both on a new proposal about entropy interpretation, and on 
<br />
the clarification of the order/disorder theme (several authors in this list 
<br />
could make valuable contributions to the latter, I think particularly in 
<br />
Karl's logical &quot;distinctions&quot; and neighborhood relationships, based on set 
<br />
theory; and also in Michael Leyton approach to symmetry breaking by 
<br />
symmetry extension out from group theory; in Gyuri's approach, Loet's, etc. 
<br />
And of course, some of 'complexity science' approaches to order/disorder, 
<br />
e.g., based on Kolmogorov's algorithmic randomness).
<br />
<p>To continue, How that 'extensivity' of energy carriers measured by entropy 
<br />
might be interpreted beyond disorder? A naive response from a biology 
<br />
aficionado may be that if Temperature informs us about the average energy 
<br />
per individual degree of freedom (1/2 Kb.T), then what entropy measures is 
<br />
some sort of 'space-time increase' regarding the whole (molecular) degrees 
<br />
of freedom. Depending always on the boundary conditions (as Stan implied), 
<br />
the input of energy into our molecular system, will cause an increase 
<br />
either in the spatial extension, or in the velocity distributions, or in 
<br />
both. The molecular system, by definition, has zero entropy at 0 K, then as 
<br />
energy is entered into the system it will start to increase its spreading, 
<br />
its motions (translation, rotations, vibrations) and so to increase its 
<br />
space-time occupancy, its degrees of freedom. Energy gets always 
<br />
&quot;equipartitioned&quot; among the different degrees of freedom (the three 
<br />
translational dimensions, plus rotations and vibrations --as was much 
<br />
discussed for multi-atomic gasses, and as was also stated for solids by the 
<br />
equipartion Law of Dulong and Petit).
<br />
<p>A global metric of such increase in the degrees of freedom is given by the 
<br />
entropy calculation ---that can be approximated in terms of statistical 
<br />
mechanics and in refinements related to the famous Bolzmann-Planck formula. 
<br />
But we may also need to enter within that global quantity that measures the 
<br />
entropy increase or decrease in molecular states. In my view, this is what 
<br />
Shu-Kun attempts in his analysis of the molecular similarity cases; and 
<br />
traditionally physical chemists have used a lot symmetry and group theory 
<br />
tools for tabulating the approximations to'real' entropy changes that 
<br />
contribute to Gibbs' free energies of chemical reactions.
<br />
<p>So, entropy increase would indicate (and measure globally) the dynamic 
<br />
'sponging', the 'dispersion', the 'spreading' of matter in space-time as 
<br />
energy is added to our system. Although I have encapsulated Frank Lambert 
<br />
along most of these views, now rather then following him in his choice of 
<br />
the 'spreading' term as an alternative to disorder, I would prefer either 
<br />
&quot;space-time dilatation&quot; or 'space-time expansion' of matter.
<br />
<p>To add to these naive physical heresies of mine, let me suggest that having 
<br />
two 'laws' in classical thermodynamics should not deter us in the quest for 
<br />
a unified principle. Regarding tentative axiomatizations of 'information 
<br />
physics' (for instance, as hinted in previous fis sessions by Igor and 
<br />
Shu-Kun), we could consider a return to the initial 'transformation' 
<br />
meaning of entropy by Clausius. Then a single &quot;principle of 
<br />
transformability&quot; could take care both of energy conservation and entropy 
<br />
increase in the transformations we operate or observe in material systems. 
<br />
Together with another two arch-principles such us uncertainty and 
<br />
relativity, these three fundamental principles of information physics would 
<br />
tell any observer about the inevitable information constraints to abide by 
<br />
along his/her 'motor operations' within nature.
<br />
<p>Thanking your patience,
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. When I mention 'motricity' (or motor operations) I really mean that the 
<br />
natural sciences, particularly physics, have implied a very strong social 
<br />
commitment to epistemic reliance on the motor part of our whole 
<br />
&quot;motor/perception cycle&quot;: numbering, measurement, dimensions, magnitudes, 
<br />
'facts', methods, operationalization, standardization, etc. etc. Just for 
<br />
fun, let us note that a similar social reliance on shared motricity seems 
<br />
to occur in realms of life situated worlds apart: rhythms, dancing, 
<br />
drum-beating, marching, parading, exercising, sporting, cheering, 
<br />
applauding... we adore groupal motricity performed at a unison!
