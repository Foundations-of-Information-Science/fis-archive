Dear Karl and Rafeal and All:
<br />
<p>This email addresses your posts concerning counting, number and philosophy from the perspective of chemical syntax. 
<br />
<p>karl writes:
<br />
<p>&quot;The numbering system
<br />
is flexible enough to privide a transportable background on which we can
<br />
calculate and predict the effects of a position change of a genome in the
<br />
same classical fashion as we are able to calculate and predict the
<br />
occurrence of the next eclipse of the Moon in Central Europe. One has only
<br />
to understand the tricks the numbering system plays when describing
<br />
diversity, similarity, probability and size. The size attribute of an
<br />
interdependent, autoregulated system is of a secondary importance. It
<br />
appears that the more diverse the parts of an assembly are, the more &quot;inner
<br />
tension&quot; (maybe, energy) is there. The size itself is not the important
<br />
attribute when discussing the inner diversity of subsets of a set. (In
<br />
actual fact, there is - to top it off - a super little trick concerning
<br />
size: if one categorises sets according to their inner diversity, there are
<br />
two virtually equivalent sizes.)&quot;.
<br />
<p>karl clearly expresses the power of calculations with numbers.  
<br />
<p>But, the source of the power of calculations is not merely the numbers themselves.  The arithmetics operations are essential as well.  By arithmetic operations I mean addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation and roots - the ordinary operations taught in primary schools.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the perspective of definition, an atom is &quot;indivisible&quot;.  Thus, the atomic number of an atom is not divisible by an arithmetic operation.  Note that ordinary physical syntax, mass is often expressed a real number and divisibility is not an issue.
</em><br />
<p>So, I conclude that the concept of number as described by karl is not applicable to chemical syntax.    Nevertheless, I doubt if anyone (perhaps Stan is an exception!) will argue against the concept of the atomic number and the natural language correspondence between particular atomic numbers and particular chemical elements.   
<br />
<p>Karl further writes:
<br />
<p>&quot;We have to capture the obvious feeling:
<br />
&quot;this is the same just bigger / smaller&quot; in order to begin understanding
<br />
phaenomena which appear to belong to different sciences. We have to come to
<br />
terms about what we do as we recognise two things that are the same (but
<br />
bigger or smaller) before we can attack the task of describing what we do as
<br />
we compare two things that are different in order to find similarities among
<br />
them. &quot;
<br />
<p>What exactly does karl wish to imply with the phrase:
<br />
&quot;we recognise two things that are the same (but bigger or smaller)&quot;
<br />
<p>I do not understand what is the meaning of &quot;the same&quot; in this context.  Nevertheless, I can construct large sets of numbers, each with  the have same numbers of divisors (for example , the primes).  The difficulty of untangling the similarity from the homology from the analogy from the metaphor can be be overwhelming at times.  
<br />
<p>Rafeal writes: 
<br />
&quot;the only problem I see with your materialistic stance is... that numbers are not material! so your whole underlying (ontological) argument  (being=being material) is constructed upon a contradiction.&quot;
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the perspective of chemical syntax, it appears if Rafeal is staking a particular argument of epistemological uniqueness on the concept of number. (Or, have I not understood the argument?) The atomic numbers are referenced in both natural language as a object and as a counting number in the sense of mathematics.  Thus, the atomic numbers form a logical 'commutative diagram' with references in three distinctive languages - natural language, arithmetic language and chemical language.  The logical coherence of chemical syntax is not violated by the three sources of reference - the three references merely correspond with one another.  A metaphor for this situation would be that the same sentence  (&quot;I love you.&quot;) could be expressed in three languages and the meanings would correspond with one another.    
</em><br />
<p>If this issue were addressed from the perspective of phenomenology, is the same phenomena under description / narrative construction?
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry
