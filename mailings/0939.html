<p>
I dared to participate in the International Nonlinear Sciences 
<br />
Conference (INSC) 2003 that took place last February 7 - 9, 2003 in 
<br />
Vienna, Austria, under the assumption that &quot;Weltanschauungen and 
<br />
perspectivism may help humans to self-organize their role on Earth&quot;. 
<br />
I expressed some of my views in the Symposium 7: Foundations of 
<br />
Self-Organization
<br />
<p>Evidently something intrinsic in the manifestation of the reality 
<br />
that humans perceived &quot;may spontaneously produce, spatial, temporal, 
<br />
or functional structures by means of self-organization&quot; whose 
<br />
principles are searched (by means of synergetics) &quot;in a variety of 
<br />
disciplines, ranging from physics, chemistry, biology to medicine, 
<br />
psychology and sociology&quot; (Hermann Haken). It is indeed quite 
<br />
desirable to answer better and better: How does Self-Organization 
<br />
Work?
<br />
<p>It is a huge question that humans will never answer completely. 
<br />
However, it evidently arises from the possibilities created by the 
<br />
energy coming from the sun that has been continuously absorbed by our 
<br />
unique planet, where water, nitrogen and other elements and a gaseous 
<br />
atmosphere allowed carbon to be naturally synthesized as building 
<br />
blocks of life. Until today, humans in a great measure still assume 
<br />
that a mysterious alchemy forged - apparently indifferent - elements 
<br />
into vital systems, which could one way or another, regenerate 
<br />
themselves making feasible the emergence of the whole terrestrial 
<br />
life and its continuous manifestation, perhaps till our sun 
<br />
disappears.
<br />
<p>Humans have also learnt that every living species may manage to 
<br />
survive only for a while, because its internal restrictions when 
<br />
facing certain external difficulties may impede every specimen to 
<br />
adapt sufficiently its behavior to environmental circumstances that 
<br />
are continuously changing under the influence of forces scarcely 
<br />
known.
<br />
<p>One of the most impressive events of such a kind, though not any 
<br />
human could witness it, is the disappearance of dinosaurs that has 
<br />
been estimated, through fossil remains, happened 65 million years ago.
<br />
<p>Other events closer to us were the emergence and disappearance of the 
<br />
Pithecanthropus (Homo erectus), Zinjanthropus (Homo habilis) and 
<br />
Neanderthal men (Homo sapiens) who apparently altogether contribute 
<br />
to make possible the emergence and presence until today of the 
<br />
Cro-Magnon wo/men (Homo sapiens sapiens).
<br />
<p>The whole evolvement of this Homo sapiens sapiens along the last 30 
<br />
millennia would be indeed a fascinating concern for every one of us, 
<br />
who should be trying to comprehend better and better how replicating 
<br />
molecules, become living cells, tissues, and organisms whose sexual 
<br />
differentiation enhances rates of change. Similarly each human might 
<br />
enjoy better his/her humane features learning consistently to develop 
<br />
his/her individual consciousness as a sense of self, supported by the 
<br />
explicit development of human language, thinking and reasoning in 
<br />
order to be ready to obstruct immediately the manifestation of 
<br />
inhuman and even antihuman feelings.
<br />
<p>The basic education of every human should perhaps first of all be 
<br />
concerned in grasping better how our immediate ancestors while 
<br />
traveling from Africa into the Middle-East and Europe and later from 
<br />
Asia through the Bering strait and to Indonesia and Australia could 
<br />
on their own develop what became the human features. We still must 
<br />
learn a lot about the sequential and interacting actions that 
<br />
happened and/or were maintained SPONTANEOUSLY by human minds, causing 
<br />
altogether the natural emergence of our species though knowing 
<br />
scarcely the terrestrial conditions and the individual possibilities 
<br />
of every human.
<br />
<p>Some important advances in the comprehension of what might be the 
<br />
self-organizing potentiality of every human were suggested by Ludwig 
<br />
von Bertalanffy (1901 -1972) who conceived the presence on time and 
<br />
in space of every human as an open system capable of perceiving and 
<br />
interpreting his/her surroundings. Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting 
<br />
and touching some or other aspects of the surroundings complemented 
<br />
with other similar perspectives communicated by other individuals 
<br />
through ideas and language makes possible to every individual to 
<br />
organize his/her performance being increasingly aware of what might 
<br />
be one or another of the various possible wholes that conditions 
<br />
his/her existence.
<br />
<p>The Bertalanffian Thinking that aims at comprehending one or another 
<br />
wholeness through Top Ë Down approach simply confirm the genial 
<br />
contribution made by Samuel Hahnemann  (1755 - 1843) who developed 
<br />
Homeopathy as an energy medicine.  According to this medicine every 
<br />
human (body and mind and even soul) must consider him/herself a 
<br />
UNIQUE being or entity with peculiar (very personal) physiological, 
<br />
psychological and intellectual (comprised the mystical assumptions) 
<br />
features, which may self-organize his/her healing by means of 
<br />
synergistic possibilities provided by homeopathic remedies. These 
<br />
remedies are peculiar concentrations of energy required for a 
<br />
particular person when he/she becomes ill due to a physiological, 
<br />
psychological or intellectual disequilibrium. He/she can be treated 
<br />
and cured by the strengthening of his/her personal possibilities 
<br />
provided by such a kind of remedies.
<br />
<p>Being every human engaged in organizing his/her performance in one or 
<br />
another societal system it becomes also necessary to examine how 
<br />
self-organizing possibilities could emerge in these systems.
<br />
<p>Gregariousness in human domains seems to be something intrinsic in 
<br />
every mind that motivates itself to invite other minds to organize 
<br />
together a certain set of activities that suddenly become a common 
<br />
concern necessarily after being gradually pondered their validity by 
<br />
each one. It becomes a set of attitudes that altogether arise in 
<br />
every mind after being interpreted the original idea and cogitated 
<br />
its content in accordance with a framework individually structured 
<br />
with many other ideas, individually generated after being peculiarly 
<br />
perceived the surrounding reality, complemented with numerous views 
<br />
communicated by others. After all is this gregariousness what causes 
<br />
every individual to encourage him/herself to recognize the need to 
<br />
co-operate with others, which means to work together for the 
<br />
betterment of what they may manage to identify as a common concern.
<br />
<p>So far it might be considered very good that various humans may 
<br />
voluntarily engage in organizing on their own their involvement in 
<br />
working together for reaching a common goal. It means that these 
<br />
humans are aware that acting and working jointly allow every one to 
<br />
attain something that he or she could never accomplish individually.
<br />
<p>So far not so good after recognizing that along the civilizing 
<br />
adventure most humans have been employed compulsively for working 
<br />
collectively in order to attain a goal that was not related at all 
<br />
with their individual and common concerns, except the need of 
<br />
determining how to survive physiologically and psychologically. These 
<br />
beings, working together as human resources, have caused the 
<br />
emergence of the magnificent civilization that has been inserted de 
<br />
facto in the biosphere. But they have been and continue being used 
<br />
day after day with the intention of making functional civilizing 
<br />
processes that have become unreasonable, illogical and inappropriate 
<br />
for the evolvement of the human species. This civilization is the 
<br />
part of the homosphere that has been built as the domain conceived by 
<br />
the elites constituted by 'well educated' and 'highly civilized' 
<br />
minorities of people who have learnt and continue learning how to 
<br />
exploit ad infinitum everything on Earth, comprised the labor of 
<br />
common people.
<br />
<p>Anyhow, it could be argued that after all the sanguinary course that 
<br />
characterized the history of civilization during the last eight 
<br />
millennia has not impeded the development of science and technology 
<br />
among other human concerns that have become the magnificent 
<br />
homosphere that characterizes the civilization that prevails.
<br />
<p>However, nowadays, all along the last twentieth century until today 
<br />
(2003), those minorities who have constituted themselves as 
<br />
decision-makers of the evolvement of the human society are not 
<br />
realizing at all how dangerous for the survival of the human species 
<br />
have become certain self-organizing activities based on science and 
<br />
technology.
<br />
<p>Let me take the liberty of mentioning some of activities because in 
<br />
the view of several of my congeners and mine these activities may 
<br />
even caused the collapse of the whole civilizing adventure as it was 
<br />
expressed already since August 6, 1986 by Gabriel Garcia Márquez: The 
<br />
Cataclysm of Damocles.
<br />
<p>The sinking of Lusitania liner, without any warning, by a German 
<br />
submarine in the Atlantic in May 1915
<br />
<p>The bombing in 1937 of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War by 
<br />
German planes in support of Franco.
<br />
<p>The German air raids (Blitzkrieg) on London in 1940
<br />
<p>The bombing of German cities by English and USA planes in 1944 after 
<br />
the German armies were already defeated
<br />
<p>The bombing of Japanese cities
<br />
<p>The drop of two atom bombs on Hiroshima (6 August 1945) and Nagasaki 
<br />
(9 August 1945) that killed one third of the population that 
<br />
inhabited these cities. In addition, as it was decided to kill as 
<br />
many Japanese as possible, &quot;1000-plane raid five days after Nagasaki 
<br />
on what remained of major Japanese cities, a triumph of military 
<br />
management skills designed to be «as big a finale as possible» the 
<br />
official Air Force history relates;... Thousands of civilians were 
<br />
killed, while amidst the bombs, leaflets fluttered down proclaiming: 
<br />
«Your Government has surrendered. The war is over»...&quot; (Year 501. The 
<br />
conquest continues. Noam Chomsky 1993)
<br />
<p>Since 1945 onwards many technological innovations have been used for 
<br />
modernizing the killing of people
<br />
<p>Poisoning by gas
<br />
<p>Poisoning of water supply
<br />
<p>Mining of roads
<br />
<p>Toxic defoliants
<br />
<p>Chemical warfare
<br />
<p>Biological warfare
<br />
<p>Many diverse nuclear missiles
<br />
<p>In addition it has been practically  'institutionalized' the bombing 
<br />
of innocent people hoping that this will result in a change of 
<br />
leader: China 1945 - 1946, 1950 - 1953; Korea 1950 - 1953; Guatemala 
<br />
1954, 1960, 1967 - 1969; Indonesia 1958; Cuba 1959 - 1961; Congo 
<br />
1964; Perú 1965; Laos 1964 - 1973; Vietnam 1961 - 1973; Cambodia 1969 
<br />
- 1970; Lebanon 1983 - 1984; Grenada 1983; Lybia 1986; El Salvador 
<br />
1980s; Nicaragua 1980s; Panamá 1989; Bosnia 1995; Sudan 1998; Former 
<br />
Yugoslavia 1999; Iraq 1991, Afghanistan 1998, 2001 - 2002
<br />
<p>Mass media for terrorizing people's mind till decerebralizing them.
<br />
<p>&quot;Modern War , pursued to its logical end, means not the defeat of the 
<br />
enemy but its total extermination&quot; (using technological weapons 
<br />
scientifically designed); &quot;..not the resolution of the conflict but 
<br />
the liquidation of the opposition.&quot; (Lewis Mumford, 1954)
<br />
<p>The danger is growing day after day but also is growing the 
<br />
consciousness in more human minds about the need of talking clearly 
<br />
and effectively with empowered decision makers about the convenience 
<br />
of creating a peaceful perspective for humankind for searching how to 
<br />
increase the survival chances of our species.
<br />
<p>Nobody, including me, can prove, ascertain or demonstrate that either 
<br />
the apocalypse is nearly to happen; or can assure that one or another 
<br />
God will finally rescue the good people; or can certify that nothing 
<br />
can be done for avoiding the karma laws or regulations or can give 
<br />
enough evidence about the manifestation of evolutionary forces that 
<br />
will create inevitably a new perspective for human life whatever 
<br />
might be the number and dimension of failures of human performances.
<br />
<p>Therefore I dare simply to assume that we, the humans alive at 
<br />
present, might behave more constructively among us taking care of the 
<br />
rather restricted possibilities that still offer our unique planet to 
<br />
our descendants. However, such assumption may be considered an urgent 
<br />
CALL after recognizing  that &quot;The human race has only one or perhaps 
<br />
two generations to rescue itself, according to the 2003 State of the 
<br />
World report by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute.The longer 
<br />
that no remedial action is taken, the greater the degree of misery 
<br />
and biological impoverishment that humankind must be prepared to 
<br />
accept, the institute says in its 20th annual report.&quot;  [The Guardian 
<br />
