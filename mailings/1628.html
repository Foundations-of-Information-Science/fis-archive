<p>
Dear Loet, Rafael, Stan and colleagues,
<br />
<p>I know I’m treading in troubled waters when I argue for the strict 
<br />
distinction between the methods of science and those of other 
<br />
disciplines. My understanding is that a majority of philosophers of 
<br />
science today would disagree with me. I suspect, from what I read, that 
<br />
most such philosophers would favor, generally, Kuhn’s view, to Popper’s. 
<br />
Interestingly, I find that most physicists would hold that the work they 
<br />
do is continually authenticated and validated by observation. I think 
<br />
most physicists are mistaken about that, however.
<br />
<p>I’m merely arguing from experience. Most of what I read these days in 
<br />
reputable, refereed physics journals, and it’s mostly in the narrow 
<br />
field of quantum measurement theory, is not very valuable. Much of it, I 
<br />
find, is nonsense, not well supported by either logic or observation. 
<br />
There seems to be a proliferation of supposition and speculation, even 
<br />
obfuscation sometimes, which I’m sure, does not follow from a genuine 
<br />
search for nature’s secrets, and cannot result from the rigorous methods 
<br />
of science. I think, and regret, that much of what professional 
<br />
physicists produce, these days, is not very good science.
<br />
<p>It wasn’t always so. Reading articles in physics journals from fifty or 
<br />
more years ago is almost always useful. Such an article may be arcane 
<br />
and limited, even by physics standards, but is almost always good 
<br />
science, and accurate, I’ve found. I attribute some of that distinction 
<br />
over time to the excuse afforded by some philosophers of science for 
<br />
self-serving speculation and political influence, rather than 
<br />
controlled, careful observation and logic, as the essential regimen of 
<br />
the scientific process. You know, if science is really just a political 
<br />
process of advocacy of personally advantageous conjecture, with the 
<br />
appropriate appearance of real science in publication, I’d be foolish 
<br />
not to do the same for myself.
<br />
<p>My very careful reading of Kuhn’s book indicates that his essential 
<br />
argument is based on a history of the behavior of many acknowledged 
<br />
scientists. Specifically, that if a lot of scientists acted in self 
<br />
interest, rather than genuine and regimented pursuit of nature’s truths, 
<br />
then the scientific method must be, of course, just whatever those 
<br />
scientists were doing. As you may suspect, I find such a conclusion 
<br />
unsubstantial.
<br />
<p>I recognize there is more in Kuhn’s book than only this. He argues for a 
<br />
culturally-derived paradigm shift in the actual perceptions of 
<br />
observation. I’m sure he’s mistaken about that, also. And, I believe I 
<br />
can support that conclusion persuasively. (I’ll do it some time.)
<br />
<p>As I’ve made the distinction between philosophy and science, Rafael, 
<br />
I’ve maintained that the methods of those disciplines are separate. 
<br />
Obviously, we don’t attempt to refute the estimable works of Plato, or 
<br />
Kant, or Aquinas, say, by controlled experiments. Those philosophic 
<br />
teachings are subjected to much different standards of validation.
<br />
<p>But, it is because of the continued agreement of Newton’s Laws, and 
<br />
Einstein’s, with persistent observations on stars, planets. elementary 
<br />
particles and such, that we recognize these scientific theories as 
<br />
valid. They do, indeed, describe our physical world. None have ever been 
<br />
refuted by careful, repeatable experiments (within the bounds of their 
<br />
applicability). I take this, Rafael, not to be a matter of “faith” but 
<br />
of observable fact. (I do recognize that some philosophers, like Kuhn, 
<br />
have questioned the universality of human observations.)
<br />
<p>I, too, have seen it happen, Stan, that an experimenter fails to 
<br />
investigate any situation which could refute his hypothesis. Or, as you 
<br />
say, to reconfigure any problematic ancillary assumptions. And to only 
<br />
observe carefully, and to emphasize, phenomena that are confirmatory. 
<br />
Sad to say, I’ve found it to be usual, in fact.
<br />
<p>Which is why repeated and varied experiments by different investigators 
<br />
are necessary. And why real integrity, and respect for truth, is so 
<br />
essential to authentic science. As I see it, the problem is not with the 
<br />
scientific method, but with the methods of some scientists.
<br />
<p>Rafael, you write that statements of what is, or what is not, the 
<br />
scientific methodology, Popper’s falsifiability theory, for example, 
<br />
“are of course, not 'falsifable'. That means, that the foundation of 
<br />
science cannot be, itself, scientific. Popperianism has be itself 
<br />
'falsified' not just by Kuhn. The problem with some Popperians is that 
<br />
they never accepted to be refuted and thus got into contradiction with 
<br />
their own dogmata.”
<br />
<p>Yes, I certainly agree that Popper’s theory of the foundational 
<br />
principles of science is not, itself, subject to observational 
<br />
refutation. That is just the point I’ve been asserting. The philosophic 
<br />
foundations of science cannot, as you say, be scientific. Because 
<br />
they’re not science, they’re philosophy, and we judge them by 
<br />
philosophy’s standards, not those of science. As Plato’s, or Hume’s 
<br />
philosophy, is not observationally falsifiable, so also for Popper’s. I 
<br />
see no contradiction there.
<br />
<p>Thanks for all the stimulating comments.
<br />
<p>Cordially,
<br />
<p>Michael Devereux
