<p>Dear Pedro,
<br />
<p>I receive your message loud and clear! It is one that has been sent to me
<br />
by many biologists as well -- &quot;How can you concentrate on flows of
<br />
palpable material or energy and disregard all the informational and
<br />
non-material clues and triggers that occur in an ecosystem?&quot; I should say
<br />
right off, that I have always had much sympathy with those who pose this
<br />
challenge, and recently I have found myself coming over to the view of the
<br />
semioticists.
<br />
<p>That having been said, I don't think it futile to continue to work with
<br />
networks of material, energetic or cash flows, so long as one maintains
<br />
the phenomenological perspective. In my first book, &quot;Growth and
<br />
Development:  Ecosystems Phenomenology&quot; (iUniverse.com), I attempted an
<br />
apology of my approach as follows (pp29-30.):
<br />
<p>************************************************************************
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, the thrust in thermodynamics towards generality runs counter
<br />
to the direction of most biological description, which strives to
<br />
differentiate life forms and processes to the greatest degree possible
<br />
until each observation can be uniquely catalogued.  The resulting
<br />
picture is one of a living world so manifold, intricate, and complex as
<br />
to seemingly defy any hope of uniform quantification.  It is also, at
<br />
times, a picture of extreme beauty; and anyone needlessly rejecting all
<br />
detail does so at the peril of justifiably being labelled boorish and
<br />
insensitive.  Therefore, it is categorically stated here that this
<br />
effort to portray ecosystem dynamics in terms of &quot;brute&quot; flows of
<br />
material and energy (Engelberg and Boyarsky, 1979) is not an attempt to
<br />
abnegate the value of descriptive biology or of matters numinous.  Most
<br />
will agree that an individual's creations in the arts or literature are
<br />
valued more than his ability to consume food.  Still, if the artist
<br />
does not eat over a long enough period, he/she dies.  Similarly, the
<br />
members of an ecosystem may behave in bizarre and intricate ways in
<br />
response to a myriad of nonmaterial cues in the environment.  Most such
<br />
behavior can be shown to affect the pattern of material and energetic
<br />
exchanges in the ecosystem.  Still, these extremely intriguing actions
<br />
remain contingent upon the underlying networks of brute flows.  Just as
<br />
the phylogeneticist observes that those traits shared by the greatest
<br />
number of species are the most primitive, so the phenomenological
<br />
ecologist points out that those attributes shared by ecosystems with
<br />
the rest of the universe are also the most elemental and, in at least
<br />
one sense of the word, the most essential.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The flows make possible the higher level behaviors, which in turn
<br />
help to order and coordinate the flows.  So reflexive is this couple
<br />
that the description of one member lies implicit in the description of
<br />
the other element.  It is in this reflexive sense that a key postulate
<br />
in the development of the current thesis should be understood;  to
<br />
thermodynamically describe an ecosystem, it is sufficient to quantify
<br />
the underlying networks of material and energy flows.  A more general
<br />
form of the postulate would read: the networks of flows of energy and
<br />
material provide a sufficient description of far from equilibrium
<br />
systems.&quot;
<br />
*********************************************************************
<br />
<p>Note that the phenomenologist strives only for a sufficient description
<br />
and not for causality. Once one discovers a regular pattern, one can then
<br />
embark upon an invesigation of causalities that lie behind it (as I did in
<br />
my second book. :) My attitude has been that we must learn to walk before
<br />
we can run.
<br />
<p>The best,
<br />
Bob
