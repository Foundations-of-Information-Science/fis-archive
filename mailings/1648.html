<p>
Dear Loet and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the messages of some days ago. As I see it, Loet, the 
<br />
writings of Kuhn and Popper, and others, attempt to describe the vital 
<br />
elements of the methods of science. While you and I haven’t debated the 
<br />
status of those books, it is pertinent to the important ideas introduced 
<br />
recently by Rafael. I believe these philosophers of science try to 
<br />
explain (some better than others), not just which methods scientists 
<br />
have effectively employed in the past, but also why these methods have 
<br />
shown themselves to be continually progressive, while other modes of 
<br />
inquiry are not.
<br />
<p>In this context, progressive means, as philosophers of science say, that 
<br />
those traditional scientific methods must have resulted in theories and 
<br />
laws which do actually describe our tangible world. They result in 
<br />
truth, if you will, and that’s why we need not excise scientific laws 
<br />
when they become old and out of fashion. Rather, we build on the truths 
<br />
taught by Dalton, and Hook, Darwin and so many others. Using those 
<br />
truths as a foundation, we may be able, for example, to more accurately 
<br />
define the scope of their applicability. Or incorporate, say, Hamilton’s 
<br />
formulation of dynamics into our quantum theory of microscopic phenomena.
<br />
<p>I agree, Loet, that the further development of sciences other than 
<br />
physics is a subject of importance, and of great interest. As I hope 
<br />
I’ve emphasized in the past, I have a profound respect for the great 
<br />
truths we’ve learned, over the centuries, from estimable intellects like 
<br />
Plato, Homer, Kant, Hume and so many others. I think they have taught us 
<br />
lessons for life that are often of much greater value than any 
<br />
scientific theory.
<br />
<p>But, quite obviously, their methods were not the methods of the 
<br />
sciences, and, in general, they’re not typically progressive. 
<br />
Philosophers continue to argue the merits of Plato and Epicuris, for 
<br />
example, but scientists do not question Newton’s laws, or Boyle’s.
<br />
<p>I’m convinced that the fundamental reason we scientists don’t persist in 
<br />
attempted revisions, or even replacement, of established scientific 
<br />
laws, is that every one of them can be validated again, here and now, by 
<br />
each one of us, in repeated laboratory experiments. (And, there’s a 
<br />
certain kind of visceral consummation in doing that.) If I doubt it, I 
<br />
can go into the laboratory and try to refute it. And that attempt at 
<br />
refutation does, indeed, go on continuously in the natural sciences.
<br />
<p>So, when you write, Loet, that “in some domains (e.g. human culture) it 
<br />
may be more difficult to repeat experiments and one has to work with 
<br />
quasi-experimentation, etc.” , I’m sure these aren’t the methods of 
<br />
science still taught to natural scientists today, the methods described 
<br />
by Arab investigators in the middle ages, codified by Roger and Francis 
<br />
(Bacon, that is), and refined by Popper, Quine and Pierce more recently.
<br />
<p>I’ve absolutely no doubt, Loet, that one ought be “allowed to study 
<br />
society’s secrets with the same rigour and using the mathematical theory 
<br />
of communication.” And, I’m certain that real integrity and honesty in 
<br />
pursuit of understanding would allow such methods to produce truthful, 
<br />
valuable results.
<br />
<p>But, if the results can not be validated by repeated, scientific 
<br />
observations, those conclusions cannot be tested by everyone who is 
<br />
disposed to dislike the result, or, who may simply choose to be 
<br />
disagreeable. I think it’s fascinating, that in the natural sciences, we 
<br />
need not depend on the integrity, or decency, or probity, of other 
<br />
scientists. We can just refute his results in the laboratory.
<br />
<p>Philosophers of science still scrutinize and parse the methods of 
<br />
science They continue to refine our understanding of just how and why 
<br />
those methods work so effectively. I’m sure that repeated, empirical 
<br />
observations are fundamental to the scientific method, and must always 
<br />
be included as an essential ingredient.
<br />
<p>Which does not mean, of course, that those methods employed in 
<br />
understanding human culture, and which may not always rely on repeated 
<br />
experimental observation, are invalid or untrue. But, I believe, and 
<br />
most philosophers of science confirm, that such procedures, are not the 
<br />
methods which have come to be called scientific.
<br />
<p>I’ve cited the works of Rolf Landauer from the nineties. He made what I 
<br />
understand to be the definitive arguments that all information is 
<br />
physical. I’ve reread parts of his papers from time to time and still 
<br />
believe they are convincing, and even more commendable, they’re 
<br />
enlightening.
<br />
<p>My understanding of the word communication would imply that information 
<br />
is its subject. (I realize that, like science, energy, entropy and so 
<br />
on, the word isn’t always used with the same meaning by everyone, and I 
<br />
suspect, Loet, that you interpret it differently than I do.) I would 
<br />
argue that there is no communication without transfer of information 
<br />
between separate entities. (People, for example.) And that, therefore, 
<br />
if it’s communication, physical information (which carries measurable 
<br />
energy, as, say a molecule does) must be exchanged.
<br />
<p>I hope no one will construe my arguments to imply that i’m denigrating 
<br />
research which doesn’t rely entirely on experimental observation. I know 
<br />
of some of the extraordinary accomplishments and profound insights 
<br />
resulting from such work. But, I am emphasizing that such research is 
<br />
not pure science, and doesn’t follow what does seem to be the accepted 
<br />
scientific method.
<br />
<p>I think we’re all better off for that diversity. But, what worries me, 
<br />
is a possible diminution of the natural sciences, where sloth, or 
<br />
unreason, or just selfish interest, may find an excuse in ambiguous use 
<br />
of the term scientific method, or lack of a determined defense of the 
<br />
historical efficacy of those methods., for the publication of nonsense 
<br />
camouflaged with a scientific imprimatur.
<br />
<p>Cordially,
<br />
<p>Michael Devereux
