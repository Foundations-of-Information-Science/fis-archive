Dear Loet
<br />
<p>I see your point in resource vs. knowledge based economy and I am aware that
<br />
you researched extensively in this area. We are probably looking from quite
<br />
a different perspectives on these issues. From mine perspective, the
<br />
important questions is how socioeconomic systems evolve in one direction or
<br />
the other (resource vs. knowledge) and how this evolution impacts on the
<br />
environment. For example, how and why Western societies moved from the
<br />
&quot;resource&quot; based to the &quot;knowledge&quot; based economies. Or what makes India to
<br />
extend in the of &quot;M&quot; compared to the &quot;N&quot; direction? The matrix itself cannot
<br />
say nothing about the impact on environment of different combinations MxN,
<br />
which is my primary concern in this discussion. As an example, let's extend
<br />
the New York-Calcutta dichotomy at the respective national levels. As you
<br />
see from the table, the US,  which has knowledge-based infrastructure
<br />
substantially more developed than India, has its respective ecological
<br />
impact world-wide 13 times higher (as measured by Ecological Footprint) and
<br />
it consumes 15 times more energy per capita.  At the same time, the energy
<br />
efficiency of their economies measured by the GDP per unit of energy use is
<br />
nearly the same - in fact US lags a bit behind India. Few people would
<br />
agree, except perhaps neoclassical economists, that this situation points in
<br />
the US being more sustainable than India. In fact many ecological economist
<br />
would argue the other way around.

<br />
<p><p><p>I don't believe that strictly formal or strictly physical (thermodynamic)
<br />
approaches can answer plausibly questions related to sustainability of
<br />
developed and developing economies. The problems and alternative solutions
<br />
are embedded in a wider cultural context of individual societies, therefore
<br />
I insist on the relvance of worldviews. The Western worldview triad
<br />
(rationality, materialism and working ethic) can be derived from economic
<br />
history of Western Europe without resorting to Max Weber and the Protestant
<br />
ethic but this issue is out of the main scope of the discussion theme. The
<br />
main point of  the role of Weltanschauung (which elements are often find in
<br />
the definitions of culture) can be rephrased as following: collective
<br />
behavior is streamlined by institutions and institutions are contingent on a
<br />
particular culture. One cannot change arbitrarily the first without first
<br />
changing the latter. And if the prevailing behavioral patterns related to
<br />
production and especially to consumption do not change substantially in
<br />
Western societies than I don believe that any increase in the knowledge
<br />
component of economy may compensate it. I think that Stan put all this very
<br />
clearly &quot;All exist in the material world, and ALL are resource based!
<br />
Definitions of &quot;knowledge-based economy&quot; that I found from OECD and UNCE
<br />
give the impression that this constraint has been somehow circumvented.
<br />
<p>That is all from my side for the moment. I will be out of the office for the
<br />
rest of the week and Bob will post our joint reply to Pedro.
<br />
<p>Thank you for your comments and insights!

<br />
<p><p>Dear Igor and colleagues,
<br />
<p>I don't buy your definitions of &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; as being necessarily
<br />
homogenized under a dominant one which can be simplified as &quot;materialism&quot;,
<br />
&quot;rationality&quot; and &quot;Protestant ethic&quot;. I think that we have moved in
<br />
sociology beyond these Weberian definitions. However, I agree that the other
<br />
issue is more interesting for the discussion on this list. (Perhaps, the two
<br />
problems cannot so easily be separated, but let us assume that for a
<br />
moment.)
<br />
<p>The transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based economy is
<br />
not to be placed at the middle of the 20th century as your email suggested,
<br />
since this has been a post-Coldwar development. The first documents using
<br />
the words &quot;knowledge-based economy&quot; in OECD circles are from 1996 (on the
<br />
basis of drafts from 1994). Thus, we are talking about a current transition.
<br />
For example, this transition was central to the Lisbon agreements of the EU
<br />
summit of 2000.
<br />
<p>What is the difference? Let me take a simple example. Compare two megacities
<br />
like Calcutta and New York. Both have of the order of 10^7 inhabitants. New
<br />
York is much more resource-intensive (in terms of using energy, etc.) than
<br />
Calcutta, but few of us would consider Calcutta as more sustainable than New
<br />
York. For example, in New York the streets are reasonably maintained and
<br />
clean, and one lives with much less risk of infections, etc.
<br />
<p>What makes the difference between Calcutta and New York? I would say a
<br />
knowledge-based infrastructure like first a sewage system, but then also a
<br />
telephone system, a subway system, etc. In short, a whole set of
<br />
communication networks in New York which does not exist in Calcutta. The
<br />
system is better sustainable because a set of coordination mechanisms is in
<br />
place which proliferates on top of &quot;hardware&quot;.
<br />
<p>Let us formalize this notion of communication systems which are added to the
<br />
people. As noted above, the N of both systems is of the order of 10^7. The
<br />
communication systems can be considered as an M. Thus a matrix N x M is
<br />
shaped. In the case of Calcutta N dominates this matrix and therefore the
<br />
system is &quot;natural&quot;. As M expands, it can take over the dynamics. The
<br />
supporting capacity of the system (the maximum entropy) is N x M. The
<br />
extension of M to (M + 1) enlarges the matrix with N (= 10^) possibilities.
<br />
The extension of M is knowledge-based, while the extension of N is
<br />
resource-based.
<br />
<p>Please, note that this has nothing to do with &quot;materialsm&quot;, &quot;realism&quot; or &quot;a
<br />
Protestant work ethic&quot; as you wished to suggest.
<br />
<p>With kind regards,
<br />
<p><p>Loet

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Loet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your remarks!  Our definition of &quot;worldview&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically equal to the term Weltanschauung, and differs only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that it explicitly introduces objective knowledge as its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitutive part - a distinction that is methodologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate for analysis of Western societies. We do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acknowledge the existence of mutually competing worldviews,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but there is always a dominant one that streamlines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collective behavior. We can, for example, condense the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prevailing (Western) worldview around three basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions: materialism, rationality and hard-wired working
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ethic (details are presented in Matutinovic, forthcoming in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; International Journal of Sustainable Development and World
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ecology). This may be put also in different terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (dimensions), but any such combination of values and beliefs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be internally coherent and it must logically link to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extant institutional framework. The very existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative worldviews in modernity, which &quot;disturb one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another and thus provide another source of change&quot;, as you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mention it, provides one of the pillars of societal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adaptability. We wished to emphasize that the pace of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adaptive institutional change is unpredictable, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore, Western civilization runs the risk of a major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environmental crisis (see for example latest reports on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of global ecosystems: Mooney, H., Cropper, A., and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reid, W. (2005).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning the knowledge-based economy and its impact on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment, I have a question: if we, for example, label the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first fifty years of the 20th century as belonging to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resource-based economy and the subsequent period as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transition to the knowledge-based economy, than I can see no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improvement at all. On the contrary, as our technology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes more advanced and our communication possibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; widen and become more sophisticated our impact on environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increases. This can be seen on the example of IT industry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which epitomizes the &quot;New&quot; economy: computer manufacturing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uses about 1000 toxic materials, including heavy metals, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its product life cycle is extremely short resulting in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enormous waste disposal and leaching of toxics into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment. Following is the quote form E. Williams,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Environ. Sci. Technol., 38 (22), 6166 -6174, 2004:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The total energy and fossil fuels used in producing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; desktop computer with 17-in. CRT monitor are estimated at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6400 megajoules (MJ) and 260 kg, respectively. This indicates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that computer manufacturing is energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intensive: the ratio of fossil fuel use to product weight is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11, an order of magnitude larger than the factor of 1-2 for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many other manufactured goods.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This high energy intensity of manufacturing, combined with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rapid turnover in computers, results in an annual life cycle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy burden that is surprisingly high: about 2600 MJ per
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; year, 1.3 times that of a refrigerator.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In contrast with many home appliances, life cycle energy use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a computer is dominated by production (81%) as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operation (19%).&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Besides IT, our increased ability to apply efficiently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge to manufacturing resulted in a myriad of new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consumer products, cheap and attractive for use, which mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; production, consumption, and short life cycles overburden the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment and degrade ecosystems around the earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the meantime, the &quot;resource based&quot; part of our economic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activities did not diminish materially, except for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; share in GDP.  Concerning Western energy intensive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agriculture, it is so inextricably tied to oil reserves (both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of energy and in terms of chemical ingredients for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mineral fertilizers and pesticides) and I have not been able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to learn so far about an alternative, plausible solution for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the post-petroleum era.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you may have an idea how to relate economic networks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (as Bob and myself briefly addressed them), your vision of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the knowledge-based economy, and the constraints arising from

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Igor and Bob,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thank you for your interesting opening to the discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; While reading it, I had the impression that the &quot;worldview&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is too much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conceptualized as a single and closed system like a Kuhnian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradigm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 16th century worldviews are in flux and internally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiated/differentiating. The economic system of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; market, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; example, is mapped cognitively in a discourse other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the discourse of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics or the discourse of power. The different worldviews
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (codifications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the communication) disturb one another and thus can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; source of change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps, your own statement can be considered as one such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worldview,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; namely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one of ecosystems theory. In this view the resources are finite and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; therefore exhaustible. Information resources, however, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not finite. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowledge-based economy (unlike a resource-based economy)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other dynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the expansion may feed new loops into the system. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, Holland is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one of the largest producers of tomatos while tomatos can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be bred in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Holland naturally (because of the lack of sunshine). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; production of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tomatos is completely knowledge-based. Indeed, this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy-costly, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; energy is only finite at the level of the universe (and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the earth).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thus, one can entertain very different worldviews. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interfaces among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can be considered as sources of innovation, for example, when market
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perspectives and research perspectives can be interfaced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps, you can easily integrate this into your model?
