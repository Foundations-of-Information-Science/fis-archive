Dear Koichiro,
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kantian objective &quot;anthropological&quot; viewpoint precipitates the Transcendental Ego or
</em><br />
the speaking subject in the present tense and dynamics in time to the
<br />
latter. Time relative to the speaking subject is seen in the tense the
<br />
subject employs, while time intrinsic to the subject as a guarantee of
<br />
Kantian objectivity remains absolute. On the other hand, Kantian
<br />
&quot;physiological&quot; viewpoint seems to imply intersubjectivity and dynamics of
<br />
time in time in the latter. Time unique to one speaking subject becomes
<br />
relative to another one unique to another subject as demonstrated in the
<br />
aspect of a verb as in the progressive mode.&lt;
<br />
<p>Kant solves this problem, as you know,  by making time (and space) a _pure form_ of 
<br />
human perception (_Anschauung_). The _transcendental ego_ is the 
<br />
guarantee for giving past, present and future a _unity_ (otherwise we 
<br />
could be able to see what comes after as what comes before, changing 
<br />
the relation between causes and effects). Kants works, of course, 
<br />
under the premise that everything (and every thing) in the natural 
<br />
world is part of a _necessary_ connection (determinism), although we 
<br />
are never (!) able to get complete knowledge on this (because of our 
<br />
finitude). This is also the reason why he is sceptic about the 
<br />
scientific analysis of the brain (because of the extreme complexity 
<br />
of the subject)  and he prefers a _pragmatic_ point of view (also 
<br />
because he is not sure about what we would be able to do (!) with 
<br />
this kind of knowledge about ourselves... this was written two 
<br />
hundred years ago..)
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; At this point enters Jerry's concern
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The historical record laid down in the past (the present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perfect) is open and readable to all who attempt to repeat the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments - . . . , it is &quot;objective&quot;.
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If some or any part of the present progressive mode is frozen in the record,
</em><br />
empirical scientists could find in it a form of objectivity. This
<br />
resurrection of objectivity is from dynamics of time in time, instead of
<br />
dynamics in time in the latter of which Kantian objectivity seems
<br />
invincible. How about that?&lt;&lt;
<br />
<p>I do not see (under a Kantian viewpoint) a contradiction in this, 
<br />
since frozen time is again part of the _arrow_ of time, i.e. 
<br />
belonging to the past. This is not the case when we consider human 
<br />
actions as far as what we have done is not only (as Freud clearly 
<br />
saw) part of our present living  (i.e. of our present progressive 
<br />
tense in Koichiro's terminology) but also something that opens (or 
<br />
closes) our future as far as it defines possibilities of action. Our 
<br />
future comes (or does not) from our past. In other words, we are able 
<br />
to reinterpret (and re-construct) constatly our lives (as individuals 
<br />
and as societies).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt; Of course, there is a legitimate attempt for approaching the present
</em><br />
progressive or action on the spot via statements made in the present tense.
<br />
Bob Artigiani's Value, Ethics and Moral is certainly one.  What concerns me
<br />
is how to make a Kantian physiology or an objectification via
<br />
intersubjectivity out of this. (I am not thinking of &quot;selfish&quot; genes that
<br />
could remain legitimate exclusively in the perfect mode).&lt;&lt;
<br />
<p>Ethics is a attempt to look at morality under an _objective_ point of 
<br />
view. Morality is the viewpoint of ourselves under the present 
<br />
progressive tense. This is the reason why ethics (as Aristotle said) 
<br />
always remains abstract (!) up to a certain degree, just because the 
<br />
concrete situation and the corresponding attitude (in the presente 
<br />
progressive tense) cannot be (deterministic) foreseen. There is a 
<br />
_chiasm_ . This chiasm  (or _abyss_) is at the center of human 
<br />
condition, i.e. of what nature has made of us. It is not very 
<br />
pleasant to live without knowing what we _should_ do. As far as I 
<br />
understood the discussion in this list, I see that life operates (up 
<br />
to a certain degree) also with this kind of non-deterministic (or 
<br />
_informational laws_: this term is a kind of _embarrassment_ or 
<br />
_Verlegenheitsausdruck_) processes, where the chiasm between the present 
<br />
tense and the present progressive tense can be _bridged_  only from the 
<br />
standpoint of an _observer_ (in Luhmann's sense). _Bridge_ is a 
<br />
metaphore. A bridge can be crossed in both directions. There is also 
<br />
another metaphor, namely _leap_, which is a more dynamic metaphore. 
<br />
Metaphore means (in Greek) to bring (phorein) something from one part 
<br />
to another (meta). Probably is science a _meta-phoric_ activity.
