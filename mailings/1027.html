<p>
Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This message responds to recent posts by Karl, Pedro, and Scott.  I 
<br />
suspect that most of the issues come from the difficulty of trans 
<br />
disciplinary communication.
<br />
<p>Karl chooses a narrative that explores some facets of biological 
<br />
diversity and related combinatorics.  Most biologists and physicians 
<br />
would, I think, concur with Karl's narrative concerning biological 
<br />
diversity. (Pedro appears to concur with this facet of Karl's post.)
<br />
<p>In addition, Karl raises points which I do not understand.  For 
<br />
example, when he writes:
<br />
<p>&quot;There is such an approach. It starts from mechanical principles and
<br />
generates chemical structures. Please see the usage of multidimensional
<br />
partitions, specifically the clusters of subsets with predictable properties
<br />
that are alqways present if the set size is above a minimum. These
<br />
constructs can well be used as representing the chemical elements. The
<br />
constructs obey the ordering principle n=2i**2, as observed in the periodic
<br />
table of elements.&quot;
<br />
<p>I do not understand how to go from a particular (multidimensional) 
<br />
subset of the chemical elements to a specific chemical structure in 
<br />
terms of Karl's mathematical hypothesis.  Most (nearly all) 
<br />
biological molecules are unique isomers (including optical isomers) - 
<br />
one particular multidimensional subset organized into a **specific 
<br />
chemical bonding** pattern.  The concept of an optical isomer is a 
<br />
property of the organization of the **whole** molecule and not a 
<br />
attribute of any particular chemical element.
<br />
<p>Karl, my favorite molecule is known as NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide).
<br />
It structural formula is H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).  Six of the 21 
<br />
carbon atoms are optically active.  The NAD molecule includes five 
<br />
covalent rings, three aromatic and two aliphatic.  (See an elementary 
<br />
biochemistry textbook for the exact structure.)
<br />
<p>Karl, can you demonstrate how your approach would generate the 
<br />
particular biological isomer of NAD that is common to all living 
<br />
organisms?
<br />
<p>Pedro's response suggests that my paragraph concerning the generation 
<br />
of chemical structures was mis - understood. I was referring to a 
<br />
GLOBAL mechanical process for generating the particular organization 
<br />
of atoms (and ions) into molecules.  That is, given a set of atoms 
<br />
(ie, a multidimensional set of atoms in the sense of Karl), which 
<br />
particular structures (graphs) will exist?  This includes the 
<br />
question of which optical isomers are possible.
<br />
<p>Quantum chemistry seeks to answer a much simpler (LOCAL) question. 
<br />
Given a set of atoms composed into a particular chemical structure, 
<br />
what are the motions of the particles relative to one another.  This 
<br />
is a traditional physical question concerning time, space, and 
<br />
energy.  As different chemical isomers have the same  molecular 
<br />
formula but contain different chemical structures, the motions in 
<br />
time and space are different.  It is well known that these 
<br />
differences are studied by analysis of the various classes of spectra 
<br />
(Ultra violet, visible, Infa red, NMR, microwave, etc).  On this 
<br />
point, I think that we are addressing two different concepts.
<br />
<p>The issue of group theory and its relation to the biological sciences 
<br />
is another matter.  The languaging of meaning is difficult because 
<br />
group theory is essential to many mathematical structures of far 
<br />
greater complexity than a mathematical group.
<br />
Let us restrict the discussion to the category of finite groups with 
<br />
the usual set of four axioms.
<br />
What systems can be described with this structure?
<br />
<p>Joe Rosen, in Symmetry in Science (1995), writes exclusively from a 
<br />
physical view point. He makes no claims about the intrinsic metabolic 
<br />
dynamics and communications within living systems.
<br />
<p>Robert Rosen has two books -- &quot;Anticipatory Systems&quot; and &quot;Life 
<br />
Itself&quot; which include extensive critical analysis of the 
<br />
relationships between group structures and living systems. He 
<br />
concludes from his systematic analysis that  life is not a mechanism. 
<br />
Many of his arguments are persuasive to me (and I hasten to add, some 
<br />
of his arguments are not consistent with chemical theory!).
<br />
<p>My evaluation of applied mathematics is based on an empirical 
<br />
correspondence principle - that is, the operations of the mathematics 
<br />
must correspond with the operations of the system.  Imaginative 
<br />
narratives are simply imaginative narratives.  In biological and 
<br />
chemical research, the empirical correspondences are often partitions 
<br />
- multisets or multidimensional partitions in the sense that Karl 
<br />
uses these terms.  The experimental correspondences often support a 
<br />
reflexive relation without supporting a symmetric relation in space / 
<br />
time or a transitive relation with respect to matter.
<br />
<p>Scott writes about about many issues that are irrelevant to the 
<br />
mathematics of the &quot;simplest possible&quot; mathematical representation of 
<br />
a chemical structure.  It appears that the assumption is made that a 
<br />
bipartite graph defined in terms of mathematics (nodes and edges) is 
<br />
the same graph as one defined in terms of chemical symbols.  It is 
<br />
not.  It is well known that chemical operations are different from 
<br />
mathematical operations and such an assumption is false.  Scott and I 
<br />
are not communicating about the same topic.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now preparing this work for publication where explicit examples 
<br />
(including cyclic molecules) will detail the correspondence relations
<br />
<p>Underlying these three communications are varying philosophies of the 
<br />
relations between pure mathematics, applied mathematics and our 
<br />
knowledge of various scientific disciplines.  These concerns were 
<br />
amply motivated and underscore the difficulty of trans disciplinary 
<br />
communication when the individuals have varying perspectives of the 
<br />
structures of mathematics and the structures of natural systems.  For 
<br />
me, the systematic categorization of extraordinarily richness of 
<br />
mathematical structures within category theory has eased the task of 
<br />
creating correspondence relations between mathematical systems and 
<br />
natural systems.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
