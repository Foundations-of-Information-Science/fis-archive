Hi,  this invitation for a grant may be interesting for arranging a fis 
<br />
research team. It is from Ray' s newsletter... Would anyone be interested 
<br />
in applying?
<br />
New Year Greetings to All.      Karl

<br />
<p><p><p>CALL FOR LETTERS OF INTENT TO APPLY FOR A RESEARCH GRANT - Human Frontier
<br />
<p>Science Program
<br />
<p><p><p>The Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) supports basic research with
<br />
<p>emphasis placed on novel, innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to
<br />
<p>fundamental investigations in the life sciences, which involve scientific
<br />
<p>exchanges across national and disciplinary boundaries. Applications are
<br />
<p>invited for grants to support projects on the theme of &quot;complex mechanisms of
<br />
<p>living organisms&quot;.
<br />
<p><p><p>The HFSP research grant program places strong emphasis on the involvement of
<br />
<p>other disciplines such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science
<br />
<p>and engineering in projects within the general areas ranging from molecular
<br />
<p>approaches to biological functions to systems and cognitive neuroscience.
<br />
<p>Recent developments in the biological and physical sciences and new
<br />
<p>disciplines such as bioinformatics and nanoscience open up new approaches to
<br />
<p>understanding the mechanisms of living organisms. To stimulate novel, daring
<br />
<p>ideas and innovative approaches, preliminary results are not required in
<br />
<p>research grant applications. Applicants are expected to develop new lines of
<br />
<p>research through the collaboration; projects must be distinct from
<br />
<p>applicants^Ò other research funded by other sources. HFSP supports only
<br />
<p>international, collaborative teams, with an emphasis on encouraging
<br />
<p>scientists early in their careers.
<br />
<p><p><p>International teams of scientists interested in submitting applications for
<br />
<p>support must first submit a letter of intent online via the HFSP web site.
<br />
<p>The guidelines for potential applicants and further instructions are
<br />
<p>available on the HFSP web site (www.hfsp.org).
<br />
<p><p><p>Research grants provide 3 years support for basic research carried out
<br />
<p>jointly by research teams in different countries. The principal applicant
<br />
<p>must be located in one of the member countries* but co-investigators may be
<br />
<p>from any other country. Preference is given to intercontinental teams. The
<br />
<p>size of the team should normally be 2 ^Ö 4 members with not more than one
<br />
<p>member from any one country, unless this is essential for the
<br />
<p>interdisciplinary nature of the project.
<br />
<p><p><p>TWO TYPES OF GRANT ARE AVAILABLE:
<br />
<p><p><p>Young Investigators^Ò Grants are for teams of scientists who are all within 5
<br />
<p>years of establishing an independent laboratory and within 10 years of
<br />
<p>obtaining their PhDs. Successful teams will receive a standard amount of
<br />
<p>$250,000 per year for the whole team.
<br />
<p><p><p>Program Grants are for teams of independent scientists at all stages of their
<br />
<p>careers, although the participation of younger scientists is especially
<br />
<p>encouraged. Program grants provide up to $450,000 per year for the whole
<br />
<p>team.
<br />
<p><p><p>The new guidelines for the next round of research grants are now available on
<br />
<p>the HFSP web site at <a href="../../www.hfsp.org/how/appl_forms_RG.htm">http://www.hfsp.org/how/appl_forms_RG.htm</a>.
<br />
<p>must first submit a letter of intent online. These will be subject to peer
<br />
<p>review to decide which teams will be invited to submit full applications.
<br />
<p>Full applications will be due mid-September for awards to be made in March
<br />
<p>2004.
<br />
<p><p><p>DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF LETTERS OF INTENT: 2 APRIL 2003
