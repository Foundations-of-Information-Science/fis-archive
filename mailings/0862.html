(Below a mess. from Javorszky. There have been bugs in the list; I am 
<br />
trying to reintroduce the rejected messages --Pedro)
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Ted's overall comments have provoked me the following reflection:
<br />
<p>We seem to be working collectively on a puzzle, namely what is information? 
<br />
We experience it as a specific carrier of tension. In general, when we are 
<br />
caught into a communication process, the tension generated by any news is 
<br />
solved as we understand that what has been in a deviation to our 
<br />
expectation. But what we are now trying to understand is precisely the 
<br />
nature of what we experience as 'news'.
<br />
<p>There is a shift in perception as one experiences the lack of excitement 
<br />
while understanding something. A connex I understand and have understood 
<br />
long ago does not have any thrill any more. The absence of thrill is more 
<br />
marked if I have had great expectations. But the two questions have nothing 
<br />
in common: how much am I no more surprised (to which extent am I blasé) and 
<br />
how practical is that which does no more surprise me. I may very well know 
<br />
the function of a compass and be no more surprised that it turns always 
<br />
towards North, and still I may find it extremely practical.
<br />
<p>The same holds true about a rational access to Information and Life in 
<br />
general. Once I have figured out how the two aspects are interlocked, then 
<br />
two things happen: a) the fascinating puzzle is neither a puzzle any more 
<br />
nor fascinating any more; b) I can use this insight for a lot of practical 
<br />
purposes.
<br />
<p>So it shouldn't come as much of a surprise were we to discover that a 
<br />
successful formalization of information be almost useless from a practical 
<br />
point of view, yet equally profound from the standpoint of  setting the 
<br />
foundations for a general theory of modelling relations.
<br />
<p>I would be very happy if FIS discussions could contribute to grasp in a 
<br />
rational way our concepts about systems that change in time and show a nice 
<br />
interaction between cross-sectional and longitudinal ways of containing 
<br />
information. Let me propose for the New Year that we achieve ourselves a 
<br />
great experience of dis-illusionment.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Karl
<br />
