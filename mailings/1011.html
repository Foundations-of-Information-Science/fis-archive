John and Pedro,
<br />
<p>Both in group theory as applied to biology and in music as concurrent,
<br />
recurring processes we see NEIGHBORHOOD AND CYCLICITY relations. The rhythm 
<br />
is a (temporally) longitudinal process (just like the DNA has a sooner and 
<br />
later, a beginning and an end). The accord (the musical tutti) is a 
<br />
temporally transversal information, a cross-sectional composition, where 
<br />
one cannot state that the flutes are before (sooner) than the violins or 
<br />
the brass. These are all at the same time. Here, group relations are useful.
<br />
<p>What we have to discuss is HOW MANY TEMPORAL SEQUENCES can combine into HOW 
<br />
MANY GROUP STRUCTURES. Relative to how the history of this melody, it is a 
<br />
surprise, a satisfaction or a suspenseful tension that this specific accord 
<br />
has been chosen by the composer. Among how many accords can a composer 
<br />
choose if he uses n instruments k ticks long?
<br />
<p>Best regards to Scott Muller and please give him the hint that he should
<br />
count how many multidimensional partitions are possible on n objects (that
<br />
is: how many distinct group relations can be generated on a set of n
<br />
objects). Once he has this, he will no doubt compare this upper limit (of
<br />
information carrying capacity) to the number of distinct sequences one can
<br />
generate on a set of n objects. Then, the surprise will be perfect. He shall
<br />
tell you that he will have found the mechanism by which theoretical 
<br />
genetics works. Then, we shall all rejoice!
<br />
<p>If anyone is seriously interested in the fundamentals of information theory
<br />
and music, I may suggest some work that has been done in this field.
<br />
<p>Karl

Betreff: Re: [Fis] Group-theoretic biology
<br />
<p>I realize that it is way off the music topic, but my student, Scott Muller
<br />
has been applying group theory to the foundations of information theory. He
<br />
has some nice arguments to the effect that though people like jaynes have
<br />
argued that the information mapping is arbitrary, if one actually considers
<br />
the physical transformation that one can perform on a structure, the result
<br />
is fully determined (and gives, incidentally, exactly the information
<br />
content I would calculate from my paper Causation is the Transfer of
<br />
Information). I tried to convince Scott to come to the Symmetry Festival in
<br />
Budapest, but I didn't get very far. He makes his income as a computer
<br />
(databse) programmer, and  that is on hard times right now (my brother is
<br />
having the same  problem). Anyway, Scott shows very clearly the central
<br />
connections between group theory and information theory, and has some
<br />
really original ideas concrning  the physical interpretation of information.
<br />
<p>As I said, these recent postings just prompted me to remark on this, and I
<br />
don't really have anything to add. If anyone wants to get in touch with
<br />
Scott, they can ask me, or lese go to the Complex Adaptive Systems research
<br />
Group site at the University of Newcastle in OZ. I don't have my address
<br />
book here, but a search on CASRG Newcastle, or Hooker Complexity will turn
<br />
it up. It is also addressed on my own web site here.

Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks to Sergei and Michael for their recent exchanges on theoretic
<br />
biology. Let me add that there is now included among the fis papers a
<br />
contribution of mine on the informational phenomena of the cell ('From
<br />
inanimate molecules to living cells: the informational scaffolding of
<br />
life'). It is a chapter of a whole book the editor of which is Franco
<br />
Musumeci (in this list too): his 'Foreword' for that very interesting book
<br />
can also be visited in our web (let us thank Rey Abe for his accurate
<br />
maintenance of our site!!).
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/resources/papers..html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/resources/papers..html</a>
<br />
<p>I am reluctant to get into depth about this discussion right now, in spite
<br />
of its centrality... Mixing that group-theoretic biology with the
<br />
generative-structural and communicational fis categories, and the insights
<br />
we gained about molecular recognition and cellular 'abduction' and
<br />
'constraints' in fis 2002 will be a challenging experience (this Summer,
<br />
this Autumn?). Perhaps we will be lead to re-discuss some of Ted's and
<br />
Jerry's postings months ago about fis theoretical options: the elegant
<br />
tools proposed from group theory, so useful for rationalization of
<br />
'computational fields', could they do a similar job for the central
<br />
'informational fields' (in my opinion, the triad bio &amp; neuro &amp; socio)?
<br />
Indeed we will have to examine very carefully the phenomenology of the cell
<br />
(what I tried to do in my above paper).
<br />
<p>And about music? Someone attempting to build a bridge in between the
<br />
different levels recently addressed here would do a great job. For my
<br />
taste, Michael and Andrei have gone for the 'syntactic analysis' while Juan
<br />
focuses on 'word structure' (and I was heading towards the 'emotional
<br />
utterance'--or the 'semiotics' of music?). Along this very text metaphor,
<br />
some reflection on the origins of the Western musical notation itself could
<br />
be illuminating... the accurate alphabetic 'picture of the voice' by the
<br />
Greeks, the Medieval 'picture of the song' achieved in the monasteries
<br />
(curious, Why in the monasteries?).
<br />
<p>About some of Juan's questions, the auditory perception would be caught
<br />
into similar enigmatic processes as other sensory infos. For instance, the
<br />
Weber-Fechner logarithmic law, that (in Rodolfo Llinás' opinion--2001)
<br />
underlies the octave tonal structure. The preference for '7' in quite many
<br />
of our sensorimotor categorizations could be linked to aspects of musical
<br />
representation too (the seven basic notes, but also seven colors, seven
<br />
vowels.... again see Llinás, and the classical work of G. Miller). Some of
<br />
my paper interpretations on 'cellular and tissular measurement problems'
<br />
could also be pertinent in this regard, and also would be, I think, Karl's
<br />
funny 'partitional constancy' of 7 (it is the only number with that
<br />
property!). Again, we are lead to discuss the formal grounding that
<br />
underlies the biological strategies of 'info optimization': rather
<br />
confussing.
<br />
<p>all the best
<br />
<p>Pedro
