                    I will use up my second posting for the week with the below, as it is
                    <br />
                    getting rather long.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take the recent conversation on vagueness with Stan and Loet. My first
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;reaction to reading sentences like &quot;I am not as vague as I was when I
                        was
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;a blastodisc&#x2026;&quot; was to suspect a category mistake: certainly it
                        is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;expressions (e.g. utterances) that can be vague or not vague, not things
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(e.g. organisms). But my first reaction is an old prejudice, a mindset
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is less useful, based on this form / substance distinction-- that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;vagueness is something linguistic. But just as the vagueness of an
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;utterance is something only meaningful as it emerges into a context, into
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;a situation in the world, so too, I wonder: could we take vagueness as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;example of something that hovers on the edge of the logical and the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;material?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the crux of it. To take a phrase from Gordana's paper (in Mind
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Machines 2003), we are dealing with Theory Materialized.
                    </em><br />
                <p>I will here repeat my point that Nature, our model of the World, is a
                    <br />
                    construct of models and equations based on definitions -- fundametally a
                    <br />
                    linguistic entity. It has been, for the most part, constructed using
                    <br />
                    standard two valued logic (hardly even fuzzy logic!), and, indeed. has been
                    <br />
                    made as fully explicit as possible. One difference between the World and
                    <br />
                    Nature is that Nature is logical, and, therefore, mechanistic. The World
                    <br />
                    cannot be inferred to be logical, and certainly is, in the sense of
                    <br />
                    responding differently to different inquiry about it, not fixed, but,
                    <br />
                    rather, generative. To be generative it must be vague, in the sense of
                    <br />
                    indefinite.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, YES, I would say that vagueness / indefiniteness may well be a
                    <br />
                    property &quot;on the edge&quot; of the logical and the material.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the concept of &quot;theory materialized&quot;, this I
                    think can be
                    <br />
                    found in at least two places. (1) In scientific experiments, with all their
                    <br />
                    controls, (2) In the mechanized computation of computers.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;chemical sciences.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I did not mean that science has succeeding in making the most
                    <br />
                    fully explicit models that might be POSSIBLE. Rather I meant that the ideal
                    <br />
                    in constructing scientific models is to make them as explicit as possible
                    <br />
                    given the tools at hand. This presumably serves to enhance the
                    <br />
                    technological usefulness of scientific discoveries, which goal would not be
                    <br />
                    served by, e.g., going beyond, say, three decimal places of precision. I
                    <br />
                    don't believe I have seen a scientific model using fuzzy logic, for example
                    <br />
                    (other than in systems science).

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;science, particularly the chemical sciences.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, let me see: (1) any experimental observations are bounded by
                    <br />
                    constructed initial and boundary conditions, as well as surrounded by
                    <br />
                    controls. Change any of these and the results will differ. Where is Nature
                    <br />
                    here? (2) Where, for example, do we set cutoffs, like when do we decide
                    <br />
                    that an observed chemical reaction is completed? If we change the
                    <br />
                    observational scale we will get a different answer to this. (3) And, just
                    <br />
                    generally, if we observe any phenomenon with a new approach we get new
                    <br />
                    results. Nature seems boundlessly productive, ready to give us an answer no
                    <br />
                    matter to what question we can devise. The generativity of natural
                    <br />
                    situations is a sign of its vagueness. We can never anticipate every
                    <br />
                    possibility, as we CAN do with a mechanism. (4) Consider an organism -
                    <br />
                    where is it? As it moves about we cannot locate its exact postion, down to
                    <br />
                    the flowing of its hairs or the jigging of its flesh. Consider a wave.
                    <br />
                    Where is it? The positions of these things are cloudlike -- therefore,
                    <br />
                    vague.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stan, if my memory serves me correctly, you were educated as a chemist.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and from the success of the atomic numbers in providing an organization

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;framework for chemical calculations, how do you distinguish among the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;concepts of number, matter and identity?
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: A very deep question. Approaching from what seems the more
                    <br />
                    general idea first, philosophically MATTER is delayed energy, stickiness
                    <br />
                    and delay, obstruction to the flow of energy. It was left behind as space
                    <br />
                    expanded in accelerated fashion in the Big Bang. In contrast, NUMBER
                    <br />
                    concerns the size of distinct collections of matter -- most primitively,
                    <br />
                    just: one, some, many. Finally, IDENTITY is based in the uniqueness of
                    <br />
                    configurations of matter. As to the &quot;succuss of atomic numbers&quot; in
                    <br />
                    characterizing basic kinds of matter as a guide to chemistry practice, your
                    <br />
                    implied point is that element definitions are not vague but extremely
                    <br />
                    precise. I agree that for practical purposes the supposition that elements
                    <br />
                    are collections of exactly identical particles has been a helpful notion.
                    <br />
                    But suppose we were to take seriously a switch from integers to real
                    <br />
                    numbers in describing elements. Ae you willing to assert that an element
                    <br />
                    would show itself as, e,g.,13.00000000000...000...infinity? Even if you
                    <br />
                    would opt for that, where IS any individual of this element at this moment?
                    <br />
                    That question points at quantum mechanics, whose basic notion, the wave
                    <br />
