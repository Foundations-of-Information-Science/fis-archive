<p>
Pedro--If this does not go to the list, wil you forward it?  Thanks.
<br />
<p>Morris--Thanks for the response.  If this does not get to the rest of the
<br />
mailing list and you can forward it easily, please do.
<br />
<p>You have my scheme down properly and you are debating it on solid grounds.
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to articulate and think about it.
<br />
<p>However, I will stick with the position taken.  It seems to me that the
<br />
difference in stature you mention reflects biological information.  It does
<br />
not much address the jacks-of-all-trades issue, save for the noted
<br />
inability of males to have children.  What I am talking about in terms of
<br />
trades is feeding activities, perhaps tool making, food distributing,
<br />
raiding, etc.  What anthropologists say is that these sorts of jobs are
<br />
carried on by all members of bands indiscriminately; they are not
<br />
specialized.  So I would see these activities as relating to individual
<br />
survival.  Thus a band is essentially an aggregation of individuals, a sum
<br />
of its parts.
<br />
<p>I introduce VEMs when there is a reason for them.  To me, there is no need
<br />
for VEMs--evaluations of the effects of actions on their contexts--when the
<br />
band is an aggregation rather than a system.  VEMs &quot;emerge&quot;  when a whole
<br />
greater than the sum of its parts self-organizes--when there is a set of
<br />
mutually-interdependent relations upon which all depend.  VEMs relate to
<br />
constructed reality, but the reality constructed is the society VEMs map.
<br />
I am not saying that the natural world itself is socially
<br />
constructed--although our shared knowledge of it is.  But I am saying that
<br />
there is a constructed social reality and that VEMs appear after this new
<br />
level of reality emerges.
<br />
<p>The important thing for me here is that we have a science able to track the
<br />
creation of new levels of reality, which require new languages to describe
<br />
them.
<br />
I am, otherwise, afraid we need to reduce VEMs to biology, which I oppose
<br />
as much as I oppose reducing biology to chemistry, chemistry to physics,
<br />
and physics to particles.
<br />
<p>If you look at many ancient myths, such as the Adam and Eve story, you can
<br />
see a sense of  the symmetry-breaking discontinuity associated with the
<br />
emergence of VEMs being captured.  VERY CRUDELY: The Garden = Nature; the
<br />
Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil = the creation of VEMs; the serpent =
<br />
the symbol of agriculture; and Eve = the women who invented agriculture.
<br />
The alienation from the Garden = an irreversible because thermodynamic
<br />
process--there is more entropy produced by the organization of coercive
<br />
cooperation via specialization, agriculture, or whatever.
<br />
<p>There shold be a reason for this qualitative change occurring:  The complex
<br />
System that an organized society is has a map of itself, which is J.N.
<br />
Nicholis's definition of complexity, and operating complex systems requires
<br />
distributing processing up to a point, at least--VEMs are the symbols which
<br />
can be present in the minds pf all and which allow them to anticipate how
<br />
different actions will affect the whole.
<br />
<p>The important thing here is that VEMs map the MEANING--the system-level
<br />
effects--of actions.  Thus, VEMs transcend individuals and should only
<br />
emerge with the self-organization of a system.  VEMs are how social systems
<br />
store knowledge of themselves in themselves.  External symbolic storage
<br />
systems, VEMs are new ways to store information because they record the
<br />
reduced uncertainty of a new observer--the integrated social whole.
<br />
<p>Now once such a level exists it will both develop its own logic and
<br />
co-evolve with the people whose behaviors constitute a society and its
<br />
environment.  The ability to track how VEMs change over time through
<br />
experience is also very important to any complete treatment of history, so
<br />
it is valuable on those grounds.  But just as importantly, if VEMs and
<br />
people co-evolve--and people and other things co-evolve, like plants and
<br />
animals--then why should the VEMs not influence the people?  It is even
<br />
possible, I propose, that the logical implications of a VEM system could
<br />
develop behavioral propensities which stress people and from which they
<br />
turn away.  The Self is an example of this, and there is, again, good
<br />
evidence that people in historical time developed a sense of Self, which
<br />
was not present from the beginning or from nature.  My favorite examples
<br />
are Augustine and Cellini.
<br />
<p>I need not fall on my sword over the specifics, but I am perplexed about
<br />
how we can respect the differences between the natural and human sciences
<br />
if we, in fact, do not recognize that there is something present in social
<br />
realities that cannot be explained by biology, chemistry, physics.
