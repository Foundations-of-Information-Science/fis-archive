<p>
Dear Jonathan, Andrei, and colleagues,
<br />
<p>May I offer a few remarks regarding quantum interference?
<br />
Its neccessary, I believe, to be very careful when we try to identify 
<br />
quantum interference, since not all the observable properties of 
<br />
physical objects exhibit interference. Interference implies that a 
<br />
single physical object possesses more than one value of some property at 
<br />
an instant in time. This phenomenon is of great interest to philosophers 
<br />
of science since its traditional to define a single physical object (or 
<br />
single quantum system) by single-valued, definitive characteristics. 
<br />
For instance, one elementary particle, the electron, has the singular 
<br />
properties of a specific charge, a total spin of one-half, and a 
<br />
particular rest mass. As long as the thing is an electron, it has these 
<br />
single-valued, definitive properties. And, those characteristic values, 
<br />
significantly, are identical when viewed by every observer, even if 
<br />
observers are moving relative to each other.
<br />
But the phenomenon of interference is, as we know, real. The canonical 
<br />
example is interference of light. A single photon of light can pass 
<br />
through two separated slits in an opaque screen at the same instant, and 
<br />
the light pattern thats detected beyond the slits cannot be caused by 
<br />
the photon passing through just one of the slits. Nor can that pattern 
<br />
by caused by many photons, each one of which passed through just one of 
<br />
the two slits. (I hope colleagues who are entirely familiar with these 
<br />
things will forgive me. I suspect some of us, some who are not 
<br />
scientists, perhaps, are not so well-acquainted with physics.) So, the 
<br />
interference pattern is caused by the physical extension in space of 
<br />
every photon particle. Each photon has a spread of position values, not 
<br />
just one, at each time. Just like an apple, say, or an elephant, the 
<br />
photon is located at more than one point. But unlike the elephant or 
<br />
apple, the photon can pass through both slits simultaneously. Still the 
<br />
photon is always characterized by a definitive, single value of spin, 
<br />
charge, rest mass, etc.
<br />
Another example of quantum interference is Bragg scattering of electrons 
<br />
from the periodic atomic structure of a crystal (like nickel). The 
<br />
scattered pattern detected must be due to a single electron hitting more 
<br />
than one atom simultaneously. And, the EPR experiment performed by Alain 
<br />
Aspect, for those of us familiar with it, shows that the S-state of two 
<br />
correlated photons possesses more than one direction of spin 
<br />
simultaneously. Not the total spin of the system, which is always zero, 
<br />
but spin direction, which points along multiple directions simultaneously.
<br />
Many of us know that the quantum wavevector (or wavefunction) somehow 
<br />
represents the physical object (quantum system). And, in general, that 
<br />
the wavevector is composed of a sum (superposition) of vector components 
<br />
(eigenvectors or eigenfunctions) at each instant in time. Each 
<br />
eigenvector has a complex numerical value at each time. Associated with 
<br />
each independent eigenvector is a unique value of some property of the 
<br />
physical object, its position, or momentum, or energy, etc. Multiplying 
<br />
the complex value of the eigenvector times its complex conjugate value 
<br />
gives the real value of the probability that that particular property 
<br />
will characterize the physical object at the next measurement.
<br />
So we note, very, very carefully that the wavevector, or wavefunction, 
<br />
does not, in general, specify any actual property of a physical object 
<br />
at any time, but rather specifies the probabilities of measuring each 
<br />
value for that property if such a measurement were performed. Even 
<br />
though its common to misname the wavefunction a state function or 
<br />
state vector.
<br />
And we know that these probabilities for quantum objects are calculated 
<br />
from the complex value of each eigenvector (the probability amplitude) 
<br />
but not, as is done classically, by determining the real-valued 
<br />
probabilities associated with, for example, each roll of a die. (Again, 
<br />
I hope colleagues who know these things much better than I do, will 
<br />
forgive me for going into the details that may help our other, less 
<br />
technically knowledgable, participants.)
<br />
Id emphasize, now, that theres no empirical evidence for any quantum 
<br />
interference of total spin, or energy, or any other property of a 
<br />
physical object that is observer independent. (Any property that 
<br />
actually defines the object.) So, we cannot assume that the 
<br />
superposition of eigenvectors characterizing the energy of the object, 
<br />
or those characterizing its total spin, etc., means that the object 
<br />
possesses, at an instant, more than one value of energy, or total spin..
<br />
Again, in general, the superposition of eigenvectors in the wavevector 
<br />
means there is a probability for each of several values of that property 
<br />
if it were measured at some time, not that the object acually does have 
<br />
more than one value for that property. (An electron can only have a 
<br />
single, unique value of rest energy, charge, etc.) This is so, even 
<br />
though we know that where quantum interference is observed, for position 
<br />
or spin direction, for instance, the superposition of position 
<br />
eigenvectors, or spin direction eigenvectors, does imply simultaneous 
<br />
possession of more than one value of that type of property by the object.
<br />
Cordially,
<br />
<p>Michael Devereux
