Dear WESSbookers:
<br />
<p>We will discuss the &quot;Nature of Time&quot; from 12:00 to 4:00 PM (or 
<br />
later!) on June 8, 2002 in room 284 of the Reiss Science Building of 
<br />
Georgetown University.  We plan to start PROMPTLY at 12:00.
<br />
<p>Our objective is to examine the metaphysical basis of time as it 
<br />
relates to emergence of complex systems and biological evolution. We 
<br />
would like to address such questions as:
<br />
<p>Is the concept of time a singular construct?
<br />
What is the nature of the reference for measures of time?
<br />
Can the metaphysical construct of time be organized into a 
<br />
taxonomical relation corresponding with natural structures of 
<br />
emergence?
<br />
If a temporal taxonomy exists, what are the references for the 
<br />
correspondence relations?
<br />
<p>Three members have volunteered to present &quot;Early&quot; talks.  Other 
<br />
members have volunteered to present &quot;Late&quot; talks. The submissions are 
<br />
reproduced below.
<br />
<p>Each early talk will be given 35 minutes with a five minute break 
<br />
between talks.
<br />
<p>Each late talk will last up to 15 minutes.  The remainder of the time 
<br />
will be used for ad hoc comments and open discussion.
<br />
<p>A one hour lunch break is scheduled between 2:00 and 3:00 PM.
<br />
<p>Our next WESSbook discussion will be in the Fall.  I suggest we 
<br />
continue this line of inquiry and discuss the Nature of Matter.
<br />
<p>Participants are invited to dine at a local restaurant after the 
<br />
meeting.  As usual, friends and guests are invited to enjoy the 
<br />
afternoon with us.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />

<br />
<p><p>A Brief Ontology of Time
<br />
<p>Richard Khuri
<br />
<p>The definition: Time is the movement of the outward turn of Pure 
<br />
Inwardness. (It would help to read Plotinus, Ennead, III:7).
<br />
<p>The outward turn of Pure Inwardness gives temporality two aspects:
<br />
<p>1. regularity which is guaranteed by a transcendental law - like 
<br />
character (the motions of the planets). Order, structure, 
<br />
organization.
<br />
<p>2. the arrow of time by which Outwardness successively embodies more 
<br />
and more Inwardness.
<br />
<p>Regularity relates to practical life, now mostly the 
<br />
computational/algorithmic understanding of the world that enables us 
<br />
to do well materially.  Clocks and apportionment/keeping of time.
<br />
<p>The arrow of time relates to poetic life: value - morals, beauty, 
<br />
contemplation/meditation/spiritual growth - the fullness of time in 
<br />
relation to the plenitude of being.
<br />
<p>Scientific evocations.
<br />
<p>A. How dogmatic materialism has lead to the inseparability of matter 
<br />
from mind at the subtlest levels of subatomic physics (Mind was there 
<br />
all along).
<br />
<p>B. How evolutionary theory has re-enforced the acknowledgement of 
<br />
temporal irreversibility (the arrow of time) and the hierarchy of 
<br />
being, not only with regard to greater and greater complexity but 
<br />
also a greater capacity to embody and express Inwardness (from no 
<br />
sensation in the inanimate world, to primitive sensation in plants, 
<br />
to consciousness in animals, to self-consciousness in humans with 
<br />
subjectivity, art, science, philosophy and religion).
<br />

<p>John Gray
<br />
<p>Simultaneity and the Notion of a Clock
<br />
John E. Gray
<br />

<br />

<br />
<p><p>One of the most important concepts that underlie the notion of a clock
<br />
is that of simultaneity. This concept almost disappeared in the
<br />
formulation of special relativity. Einstein defined synchronous or
<br />
simultaneity as
<br />
&#x201c;The latter can be determined by establishing by definition that the
<br />
time required to travel from A to B is equal to the time to travel from
<br />
B to A. For suppose a ray leaves from A to B at &#x201c;A-time&#x201d; tA is reflected
<br />
from B toward A at &#x201c;B-time&#x201d; tB and arrives back at A at &#x201c;A-time&#x201d; t&#x2019;A..
<br />
<p>Furthermore, he also stated the following definitions of synchronous
<br />
behavior of clocks:
<br />
<p>&#x201c;1. If the clock at B run synchronously with the clock at A, the clock
<br />
of A runs synchronously with the clock at B.
<br />
<p>2. If the clock of A runs synchronously with the clock at B as well as
<br />
with the clock at C, then the clocks at B and C also run synchronously
<br />
relative to each other.&#x201d;
<br />
<p>If we write equations with t  written as a parameter then implicit is an
<br />
assumption of continuous evolution. The passage of time implies an
<br />
ordering relation between instants of time into &#x201c;before&#x201d; and &#x201c;after&#x201d; so
<br />
that one has t&#x2019;&lt;t and t&#x2019;&#x2019;&lt;t&#x2019;  ----&gt; t&#x201d; &lt;t
<br />
<p>Note that even biological systems can be fit into this framework, though
<br />
the &#x2018;clock&#x2019; in biology is cyclic to some extent. If one could come up
<br />
with a different framework for these two properties, then one would be
<br />
well on the way to proposing a new analytical basis for time. When we
<br />
consider biological or other complex systems, the normal concept of
<br />
simultaneous goes away. In some fashion, one can retain the notion of
<br />
simultaneous, but at a cost Whitehead:
<br />
<p>&#x201c;You can find a meaning for the notion of the simultaneous instant
<br />
throughout all of all nature, but it will be different meaning for
<br />
different notions of temporality.&#x201d;
<br />
<p>While the subject of time is vast within biology, we limit ourselves to
<br />
a single area, the biological or circadian clock. At what level of the
<br />
multiple levels of internal operation that occurs within the organism
<br />
does the clock operate on. There are advantages and disadvantages to
<br />
studies based on such types of clocks. On the one hand, they exhibit
<br />
mutational invariance with respect to the background. This means two
<br />
useful things. The period of the clock is fixed relative to the
<br />
background environment that the clock is operating within. The clock is
<br />
temporally (translation) invariant across  some epoch.  This would mean
<br />
a no-interaction theorem between the clock and the environment it
<br />
operates within. There is no Darwinian advantage or disadvantage gain by
<br />
the usage of such a clock.
<br />
<p>The question of scale is also relevant to a discussion of biological
<br />
organization. The time scale for biological process does not follow a
<br />
universal clock, so that many internal processes have their own
<br />
individual clocks. These clocks do not necessarily scale to form a
<br />
universal clock for an organism clock such as the corporation clock or
<br />
of the business cycle for that matter. A degree of harmony must drive
<br />
the operation of the entire system so that the components are
<br />
synchronized, otherwise failures arise. Any complex organization needs a
<br />
measure of consistency related to its clock operations. In well designed
<br />
artificial organizations, these are such measures of consistency. (Real
<br />
time systems have synchronization signals to maintain data flow.).
<br />
Clocking mechanisms that allow the organism to adapt &#x201c;exactly&#x201d; has
<br />
evolutionary advantage. Thus an internal metric simulation of one of the
<br />
world&#x2019;s external clock allows the organism to synchronize its behavior
<br />
with some naturally periodic behavior. This has a definite evolutionary
<br />
advantage for some types of natural clocks. However, not all
<br />
environmental processes are exactly periodic, but instead are
<br />
quasi-periodic. They exhibit an essentially random driving mechanism
<br />
such as a sinusoidal wave driven by random noise. Another possibility
<br />
would be to have a process that appears to be chaotic (or completely
<br />
random with on quasi-periodic nature). We discuss the underlying
<br />
mathematics for measuring &#x201c;clock distances&#x201d;.

<p>Andy Vogt
<br />
<p>Title: Clock Time
<br />
<p>&nbsp;The speaker will discuss the concept
<br />
of time used in science, addressing such issues as:
<br />
time in relation to matter and space, time as an
<br />
abstraction from multiple clocks, standards of time,
<br />
Newtonian time, relativistic time, time reversal and
<br />
thermodynamic time, big-bang time, and the local
<br />
and global nature of time.
<br />
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>Late Speakers
<br />
<p>George Farre
<br />
<p>Quantum physics contemplates two distinct notions of time, one due to 
<br />
Schroedinger, the other due to Heisenberg.  The difference have 
<br />
consequences, and I'd be happy to talk about them briefly
