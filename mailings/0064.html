<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>just a few comments motivated by the really exciting topics raised so far.
<br />
<p><p>1. INFO &amp; THERMOD. ENTROPY
<br />
<p>For my taste Werner's points capture very appropiately the subject. The
<br />
congruence between Boltzmann &amp; Shannon's approaches seems very well
<br />
established. In my own language, the former refers to the possible number
<br />
of space-time dislocations and the latter to positional combinations of
<br />
signs. Appropiately chosing their definition spaces (Werner &amp; Jerry) they
<br />
coalesce into a unitary approach.
<br />
<p>However, if we take seriously the possibility of using the distinctional
<br />
signs (remember, those very ones that Tom, Soeren and I agreed last month
<br />
that they might constitute the info &quot;grain&quot;) following a &quot;compositional&quot;
<br />
strategy instead of a positional one, then Karl Javorsky (1995) may be
<br />
right and we could arrange for a new counting based on &quot;multidimensional
<br />
partitions&quot; in order to give the real communicational possibilities of this
<br />
alternative compositional info strategy. Let me remember the hint I made
<br />
that this &quot;partitional calculus&quot; might underly the cellular signaling
<br />
system mysterious processing operations.
<br />
<p>In general, compositional info &quot;entropy&quot; would be different from the
<br />
Shannon's &amp; Boltzmann´s countings. Actually the math. relationship between
<br />
them could be quite curious: depending on the chosen set of distinctional
<br />
signs there might appear max. and min. values-- and relevant biological
<br />
parameters, eg of the genetic code, would seat precisely on such min.max
<br />
values! (again I am following Javorszky)
<br />
<p>Actually, most of what Werner calls &quot;free information&quot;, term which itself
<br />
is highly thought-provoking, could have the form of this compositional
<br />
info, far easier to be used in order to connect &quot;compositions of sets&quot; (and
<br />
to count the consequences of their inner productive and degradative
<br />
processes).
<br />
<p><p>2. INFO AND THE PROBLEM OF &quot;STRANGE EXISTENCES&quot;
<br />
<p>In his Volume 6 of &quot;A la Recherche du Temp Perdu&quot;, Marcel Proust disagrees
<br />
with the conventional views about nations as entire entities. He insists
<br />
that they have to be contemplated from a perspective of &quot;continuous
<br />
creation&quot; and degradation, far above the level of individuals, generating
<br />
genuine collective organisms involved in cooperative and antagonistic
<br />
behaviors ... Can our present info &amp; physics discussion give any hints
<br />
about this strange &quot;way of existence&quot;?
<br />
<p>Also, exchanging views with Vicente Salas (participating in our fis.list
<br />
too) about the way firms and companies have to be understood, he expoused
<br />
me to some economists' discussions about &quot;the nature of the firm&quot;...
<br />
Another strange &quot;way of existence&quot; irreducible to any unidimensional
<br />
analysis, and involved in continuous creation and annihilation processes,
<br />
endowed with quite peculiar counting systems, conservation laws and
<br />
optimization principles, can be contemplated.
<br />
<p>The orchestrated cellular dances between protein synthesis/protein
<br />
degradation and the organismic ones betwen cell reproduction and cell death
<br />
appear as the biological counterparts (and the final source) of the above
<br />
&quot;strange&quot; ways of existence.
<br />
<p>&quot;Informational existences&quot;, one might apply to these entities that exist in
<br />
ways utterly unfamiliar to physics.
<br />
<p><p>3. THE INFO AND THE PHYSICS PARADIGMS, AND LIFE
<br />
<p>Maybe we have taken for granted a way of thinking about &quot;existences&quot;
<br />
derived from classical physics but also from positional languages and
<br />
alphabetic writing (I follow Mcluhan and Andreas Goppold in this regard)
<br />
that biases our own views about the political, economic, and social realms,
<br />
and even about physics itself. Perhaps some aspects of the present &quot;quantum
<br />
schyzophrenia&quot; might stem from a series of underlying ontological choices
<br />
about &quot;ways of existence&quot; that we have been historically unable to overcome
<br />
(see also Otto Rossler in BioSystems FIS 94).
<br />
<p>The philosopher Ortega y Gasset wrote a wonderful essay about &quot;Oknos el
<br />
Soguero&quot; (Oknos, the rope maker) where he comes to say just that: that
<br />
Greek, Roman and Western thought left aside the archaic way of thinking
<br />
based on the unceassant weaving and unweaving of Nature's own structures.
<br />
Nilly-willy recent molecular biology has just stumbled upon that very fact.
<br />
And it might be a fundamental constitutive aspect of most of the
<br />
supra-biological existences: neuronal, economic, social, etc.
<br />
<p>So, Koichiro final question about info &amp; physics, already very cogently
<br />
commented by previous co-discussants, could be restated from this point of
<br />
view as saying that the current bio (and complexity) revolution might
<br />
contribute to a new vertical info paradigm coherently contemplating &quot;info
<br />
existences&quot;, perhaps extending to realms of physics too. Who knows whether
<br />
something interesting in this regard might be meaningful to aleviate
<br />
quantum schyzophrenia...
