Herewith is Ray's obituary I have found in the web. ---Pedro
<br />
<p><p>Ray Paton (1954-2004)
<br />
(Department of Computer Science of the University of Liverpool)
<br />
<p>It is with great sadness that the Department of Computer Science must 
<br />
announce the death of Dr Ray Paton on 29 July 2004.
<br />
Ray entered academia relatively late in life, after a spell as a teacher in 
<br />
a Liverpool high school. He joined the Department of Computer Science in 
<br />
1989, initially as a research assistant in the area of knowledge-based 
<br />
systems. He became a Lecturer in 1991, and was promoted to Senior Lecturer 
<br />
in 2001, and then Reader in January 2004.
<br />
Ray's main research interests were at the intersection of biology and 
<br />
computer science. He was an original, influential, and charismatic 
<br />
researcher, with collaborators across the world. Many computer scientists 
<br />
with an interest in biology are met with skepticism by researchers in the 
<br />
biology community, but Ray had the rare ability to win over researchers in 
<br />
both computer science and biology with his vision. Those who worked with 
<br />
him will readily attest to his enthusiasm and willingness to listen, and 
<br />
his skill at making connections between people and ideas. The author of 
<br />
innumerable research papers and books, Ray was also involved in founding 
<br />
and editing several journals.
<br />
As well as being a successful academic, Ray was a dedicated and loving 
<br />
father and husband: He is survived by his wife Christine and two sons, 
<br />
Daniel and Andrew. Our thoughts are with them.
<br />
If you would like to make a charitable donation in memory of Ray, the 
<br />
family have asked you to make this to Life Blood (the Thrombosis Charity), 
<br />
PO Box 1050, Spalding, Lincs PE12 6YF
<br />
<a href="../../www.thrombosis-charity.org.uk/index.htm">http://www.thrombosis-charity.org.uk/index.htm</a>
<br />
If you have a question connected with Ray's professional activities, we ask 
<br />
that you email Ms Katrina Houghton K.Houghton&#64;csc.liv.ac.uk in the first 
<br />
instance. The Department will maintain Ray's web page for the foreseeable 
<br />
future.
