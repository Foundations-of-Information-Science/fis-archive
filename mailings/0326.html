CALL for PAPERS and COMMENTS in order to participate in the Symposium IV (NIMW)
<br />
<p><p>&quot;New Image of Man and Woman
<br />
<p>supported by a new General Anthropology&quot;
<br />
<p><p>(}&quot;§&quot;§{&quot;==&quot;#
<br />
<p>This Symposium is one of the events that has been planned as an Homage to
<br />
Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy. It has been conceived as a FORUM for
<br />
presentation of papers, lectures, speeches, posters and also an Open Space
<br />
for self-organized debates and discussions. It will take place in the
<br />
<p>International Conference on Systems Thinking Globally Concerned
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy Anniversary Conference BAC 2001
<br />
<p>UNITY &lt;==&gt; through &lt;==&gt; DIVERSITY
<br />
<p>November 1-4, 2001
<br />
<p>University of Vienna and Vienna University of Technology
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
<p>&quot;=&quot;+&quot;§&quot;&quot;!
<br />
<p>It aims at searching reliable ways for building the interdisciplinary
<br />
enterprise (comprising human biology, psychology, psychiatry, sociology,
<br />
linguistics, economics, the arts,...) that may help to create societal
<br />
circumstances needed for allowing the individual emergence during the life
<br />
of every person learning on his/her own to consciously develop his/her
<br />
peculiar personality, while his/her intrinsic spontaneity was confronted to
<br />
diverse cultural, economic and social conditions determined peculiarly by
<br />
the performance of those humans that constitute every human society,...
<br />
<p>It will be taken into account that during the history of civilization, many
<br />
humans have been deshumanized due to the technological control and
<br />
unilateral (arbitrary) conquest of Nature and exploitation of masses of
<br />
people; ...being ignored that some hominids in the past could create for
<br />
the whole species an environment of their own out of symbols; which allowed
<br />
our ancestors to become living beings (humans) potentially capable to
<br />
develop abilities to direct their own evolution on ethical levels, through
<br />
the cultivation of humane values; but...
<br />
<p>The model of the human being as an open system - a GST principle - may
<br />
allow any person to see the individual human being as a whole dynamic
<br />
entity rather than as an assortment of parts, processes and traits. When
<br />
humans learn to perceive each other as a complex whole characterized
<br />
diversely by many traits (gender, age, race,...) -Bertalanffy suggested
<br />
-the world might be able to achieve a revolution of harmony.
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy believed humanity faces a clear and present danger of being
<br />
dehumanized, even destroyed, by debasing self-images. He noted that in the
<br />
past mass persuasion had been generally practiced as a craft and claimed
<br />
that this problem had taken on a frighteningly pseudo-scientific form as a
<br />
modern behavioral engineering (founded by Watson and developed by Skinner,
<br />
who were inspired by the Pavlov's conditioned reflexes in rats). This
<br />
behaviorism would lead towards totalitarianism (either a benevolent one, as
<br />
in Huxley's Brave New World, or a malevolent one, as in Orwell's 1984).
<br />
Bertalanffy was explicitly against the
<br />
positivist-mechanistic-reductionistic approach that produced this
<br />
psychological technology which aimed at increasing the control of people.
<br />
<p>Consequently he became deeply interested in finding out what would be a
<br />
&quot;new science of man&quot; or general anthropology &quot;The image of man is not only
<br />
a theoretical question,... it is a question of the preservation of man as
<br />
human&quot;
