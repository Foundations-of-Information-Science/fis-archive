<p>
Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>the discussion about complexity leads us back to our basic assumptions. The 
<br />
core point appears to be, how we perceive a): the world, and b): what we 
<br />
think about the world, and c): how a) and b) fit together. This can be 
<br />
formalised into a) how we feel, b) how we think, c) how we integrate what 
<br />
we think with what we feel.
<br />
The question of how - in what ways, what extent, in whose judgement - that 
<br />
what one thinks and that what one feels interact is the subject of 
<br />
morality, theology, dramaturgy, choreography, music and art generally.
<br />
So far, the interplay between what one thinks and what one feels has not 
<br />
been investigated by classical mathematics. There are now some approaches 
<br />
which suggest that indeed there is a rational way of comprehending the 
<br />
methods, aims and goals of that what governs the interplay among what one 
<br />
feels and what one thinks.
<br />
The approach states that what we think is a realisation of discharges of 
<br />
the nerve cells of our brain, are therefore linear (as the bursts of the 
<br />
ganglions are in a temporal distance among each other). What we feel is in 
<br />
this approach a realisation of a composition made up of commutative symbol 
<br />
carriers (as the biochemical hormones of the nerve cells in our brain are 
<br />
liquid and not sequential, they are treated as a commutative collection).
<br />
There appear some quite interesting cause-consequence relations just within 
<br />
the realm of natural numbers. This suggests that Nature - as recognisable 
<br />
via the natural numbers - does have a concept of an a-priori order, and we 
<br />
can read the ordering principles off the natural numbers.
<br />
<p>The complex discussion going on in FIS could be enriched in two ways by 
<br />
this person: explaining the connex among the symbols (detailing, what the 
<br />
logical operation of an addition implies, and which of the implications are 
<br />
in themselves contradictory), or mobilising the emotional-hormonal connex 
<br />
among the meanings of the symbols (eg by pantomimical presentations of 
<br />
relations between disjunct and monotone, by asking you to partake in a 
<br />
ballett performance so you feel the relations of closeness and belonging 
<br />
vs. freedom and lonesomeness). It is the interplay, neither the correct 
<br />
explanation, nor the virtuous feelings are in themselves in disarray, but 
<br />
how they are connected to fixed structures among each other is what the 
<br />
song is about and the additions list.
<br />
<p>The formal presentations have been made. Presently, this person works on a 
<br />
communication detailing the relations among emotional symbol carriers. This 
<br />
results in a piece of art, not in a piece of reasoning.
<br />
<p>The artwork is now present, so I am now ready again to attend these talks, 
<br />
and may offer to explain it all, by literary - emotional - means, in the 
<br />
form of a dialogue, not as a writeup. The writeup is now with a publisher, 
<br />
so we can exchange questions and answers.
<br />
<p>Karl
