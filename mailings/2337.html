<p>
Thank you Stan, that was precisely what I meant by my question.
<br />
<p>Exactly how to define informational content of things that can not be 
<br />
verbalized? (Maybe only because, as you say, our linguistics communities 
<br />
have not conquered those rare territories such as dreams or music or 
<br />
arts.) Those spheres of personal experiences we may hope will be 
<br />
explored in the future, so that at least we may learn how the brain 
<br />
processes those things.
<br />
<p>You said:
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Now, technically, I think information is just any constraint on our 
<br />
activity.  So, do dreams, and those scents and music that have not been 
<br />
harnessed by society, constrain our actions?  If not, are they 
<br />
informational?  Some information is associated to meaning by semiosis.  
<br />
But if dreams, fragrances and music are not information, we know 
<br />
nevertheless that they are meaningful to us personally.  So, can meaning 
<br />
exist aside from information?&quot;
<br />
<p>My feeling is that in dreams informational content of our brains gets 
<br />
re-structured, or re-connected in different ways. Dreams contain 
<br />
elements from real life memories, but they are differently related, 
<br />
distorted, intensified, etc. So I guess dreams have definitely 
<br />
informational content.
<br />
<p>One more interesting aspect of the problem is the approximate thinking. 
<br />
We have a &quot;feeling&quot; if something is OK or not. Very often experts have a 
<br />
&quot;feeling&quot;. Their expertise can be verbalized up to the point, but after 
<br />
that, there is a &quot;feeling&quot; - what is just the right amount of something, 
<br />
the right measure, the right thing to do in certain situation. Those 
<br />
&quot;feelings&quot; also have informative content, as they definitely constrain 
<br />
our activity.
<br />
<p>In any event, I do have a feeling :-)  that meaning and information are 
<br />
so tightly bounded that anything having meaning must be possible to 
<br />
express in terms of information.
<br />
<p>Best,
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It might be a pure feeling of sheer beauty or harmony (whatever it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be).  I wonder is there any meaning in &gt;that feeling of being one with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;music in the same flow, just dissolving in a moment? Not the externalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;meaning &gt;that you can ascribe to a music-loving listener in an instant of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;exaltation, but the subjective meaning for me as an &gt;individual. Is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;meaning in a feeling? May I say that music in that case is information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that impacts my &gt;physical body, my receptors, my brain, and changes its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;structure so that in the next moment in my life I will &gt;experience things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;differently?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;May I say that  meaning  of music for me as a subject is the result of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the difference that made the difference in my physical structures, somehow?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This raises what has been for me an issue of some interest.  I associate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some kinds of meaning with emotion.  Our culture invites only a certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limited range of emotions.  We can get an idea of how small a range this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by paying attention to the emotional content of dreams -- actually more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting that the images.  Here we experience emotions that are never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elicited in everyday life, and that are, indeed, indescribable and unique.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They are as indescribable as the scents of many of the various essential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;oils taken from plants.  Some of these associate with numinous feelings, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with encense (frankincense, olibanum) or Peru balsam, which have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;smudged in (at least) churches and synagogues for centuries.  But many (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;us) float free of any particular association, as they have not been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;harnessed by our society.  Are these 'untamed' fragrances -- and those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dream emotions -- meaningless? This brings me to music.  I now listen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;largely to Romantic keyboard music -- Schubert (the father of musical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Romanticism), Chopin (The soul of Romantic music) and Schumann (the spirit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Romantic music).  It seems clear to me that these artists have INVENTED
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain emotions that literally did not exist prior to their discovery on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the keyboard in the Nineteenth Century.  Now, these emotions are also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indescribable, but in this case it is clear that they can be (have been)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shared by many persons in the experience of art.  But, do we all agree as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the 'meanings' of these passages?  We don't really know, do we?  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems likely that neurologists might be able to discover some general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shared responses to them elicited in us during experiments, but would these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be 'describable' (translatable to language)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Now, technically, I think information is just any constraint on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;activity.  So, do dreams, and those scents and music that have not been
