<p>
Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>The comments exchanged these days about power laws --particularly Viktoras 
<br />
and Guy-- bring me back to the FIS session on music last year. Why do we 
<br />
enjoy music? Why does music so easily penetrates throughout our emotional 
<br />
structures? As I argued those days, in our perception of sound or in vision 
<br />
there is a state-space of enormous magnitude (in vision for instance, it 
<br />
may expand on 11-12 orders of magnitude! I do not know exactly in the case 
<br />
of sound, but probably it will be similar). No wonder that we are 
<br />
perceptually organized following the Weber-Fechner logarithmic law, that 
<br />
(in Rodolfo Llinás' opinion--2001) directly underlies the octave tonal 
<br />
structure of music. The preference for '7' exists in quite many of our 
<br />
sensorimotor categorizations (the seven basic notes, but also seven colors, 
<br />
seven vowels.... again see Llinás, and the classical work of G. Miller). An 
<br />
old partitional hypothesis by Karl (on 7 'constancy') helps to explain its 
<br />
advantages in navigating amidst the power laws that also appear in partitions.
<br />
<p>Formally interested parties may argue far better than me, and may help to 
<br />
formulate properly the following speculation. In our inner power-law 
<br />
organization of soundscapes, as the above Weber-Fechner implies, we 
<br />
particularly rely and detect some multi-level crossing structures, or 
<br />
'fractures', that have been evolutionary converged upon to display 
<br />
important biological communicational themes --emotionally laden. These 
<br />
differentiated 'sentic forms' (so called by M. Clyne) are played with by 
<br />
the professional musicians, or instinctively by any loving person voice, or 
<br />
by any merry child, or any angry party... a website that explores quite 
<br />
many (disconnected) artistic aspects related to sentic forms:
<br />
<a href="../../www.wavecrest.org.uk/wavecrest/Sentic%201a2.htm">http://www.wavecrest.org.uk/wavecrest/Sentic%201a2.htm</a>
<br />
<a href="../../www.wavecrest.org.uk/wavecrest/Superior%20Colliculus%20involved%20in%20optical%20pattern%20recognition.htm">http://www.wavecrest.org.uk/wavecrest/Superior%20Colliculus%20involved%20in%20optical%20pattern%20recognition.htm</a> 
<br />
<p>Sentic forms are some sort of elementary curves, with a resemblance to
<br />
natural landscapes of peaks and valleys --say, level crossing 'fractures' 
<br />
in the global soundscapes that imply a vivid signal for an immediate 
<br />
behavioral/emotional reconfiguration. Evolutionary wisdom at its best. 
<br />
Advancing in the conceptualization of sentic forms by power-laws, fractals, 
<br />
Tsallis, etc., would be a great challenge for FIS theorists --applying 
<br />
Michael Leyton  'process grammar' could be attempted too... however, I do 
<br />
not quite agree with Michael's basic thesis that musical works are per se 
<br />
maximized memory-recovery structures).
<br />
<p>The other discussion around variants of logical positivism should not be 
<br />
taken too far. Given that we face a philosophical discussion on consilience 
<br />
on next September, why we do not keep our best ammunition for that time?  I 
<br />
will just produce a couple of light comments. Besides positivism, quite 
<br />
many other interesting schools on philosophy of science have flourished 
<br />
during the 20th Century. Figures such as Whitehead, Bertalanffy, Wiener, 
<br />
Ortega y Gasset, Merleau-Ponty, Joseph Needham...  had in common the 
<br />
reluctance to single out a 'unique' scientific method, obviously inspired 
<br />
by physics, that would conduce to what Ortega called &quot;the imperialism of 
<br />
physics&quot;. A perusal in several bio-neuro-psycho-and socio- fields shows how 
<br />
devastating was during very long decades in those sciences the blind 
<br />
imitation of physical approaches. Fortunately, our contemporary panorama on 
<br />
the global knowledge enterprise is far more complex and multidisciplinarily 
<br />
oriented. As Bas van Fraassen has put, &quot;science moves forward by discarding 
<br />
past images and forgetting the agonies of those conceptual wars&quot;...  The 
<br />
other brief point I was willing to make is about the importance of 
<br />
'consilience', both in general relationships among disciplines and in the 
<br />
convergence of specialized inductions... Reminding Vannevar Bush image for 
<br />
science as the 'endless frontier', we might put that consilience represents 
<br />
the exploration of the 'internal frontiers' of science.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
