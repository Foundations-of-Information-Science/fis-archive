<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A second way that extremal principles have been suggested for living

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems is the principle of entropy production maximization (MaxEntPro). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a global principle proposed first, I think, by Rod Swenson, though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one can read a version of it back into Jaynes. It seems to violate PLA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very seriously. Anyway, Schneider and Kay have proposed an extension to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thermodynamics according to which systems use every means at their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disposal, including reorganization, to approach as closely as possible to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equilibrium. They claim to have evidence for this from ecology, though I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find the evidence ambiguous.
</em><br />
<p>I should have pointed out that S&amp;K do not relate their principle to 
<br />
MaxEntPro (so far as I know), and that Eric Schneider expressed 
<br />
considerable skepticism about MaxEntPro when I last talked to him about a 
<br />
year ago. He showed me the work on the Earth's atmosphere. However, some 
<br />
have interpreted their claim that living systems to degrade energy 
<br />
gradients as implying MaxEntPro, at least for such systems. Anyway, I do 
<br />
not want anyone to think I am foisting MaxEntPro on Schneider and Kay, or 
<br />
that I think that they accept it, or that I think that they should accept 
<br />
it. Sorry for the comment on my own post, but this is a tendentious issue, 
<br />
there will be talk about it in the near future in popular terms, and I 
<br />
needed to make this point. The following are some formal caveats. I think 
<br />
there is something exactly right about the K&amp;S principle, that it is a form 
<br />
of extremal principle, but that it needs to be expressed more clearly and 
<br />
carefully. In particular, I think that the very means by which gradients 
<br />
are degraded feed back into those means themselves, so the principle can be 
<br />
applied only locally and for short times unless certain global conditions 
<br />
hold, and that their (K&amp;S) principle does not imply global rates or states 
<br />
in itself. In particular, it does not imply MaxEntPro except possibly when 
<br />
the means of producing means are not reflexive or are entirely internal. 
<br />
Jerry's objections mention the latter, but I think the former is required 
<br />
as well -- I would guess that he assumed it because it seems pretty 
<br />
obvious. However, if optimality applies only to functions, the 
<br />
interactivity assumption (relevance of flows between external and internal 
<br />
processes to optimality issues) is violated by autopoietic and 
<br />
operationally closed systems, and at least some people don't find 
<br />
interactive flows to be relevant to optimization problems -- the 
<br />
organizational problem, for them, is to optimize for all flows in and out, 
<br />
so the values of or changes in the values of the flows themselves serve no 
<br />
function -- regulation is all focused internally. I think that organisms 
<br />
violate exactly last this double (logical sum) condition, that is, the 
<br />
means are reflexive and they are not entirely internal. I say &quot;possibly&quot; 
<br />
because I think even then the principle does not necessarily hold, but I 
<br />
have seen arguments that try to set the constraints so that &quot;by all means 
<br />
possible&quot; is restricted to those that do not constrain entropy production. 
<br />
I think that this trivializes the optimality involved, but I am not going 
<br />
to argue that here.
<br />
<p>Again, sorry for the complex and rather formal caveats.

<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The important point for this group is that, like MinEntPro, it allows 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information to be reduced out. Schneider is quite clear about this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implication in his recent writing. MaxEntPro systems are obviously highly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;non-Hamiltonian (highly non-conservative), but there is a sense in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are very mechanical like, because of their extremal behavior. One 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system that approaches MaxEntPro is the Earth's atmosphere, and fluid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vortices in general. it is precisely their lack of stable structure that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allows this. (Recent empirical work suggests that the Kolmogorov 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis of self-similarity of vortices at all scales except the larges 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is actually false at small scales, so perhaps event the atmosphere case 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not really fit the MaxEntPro model.)
