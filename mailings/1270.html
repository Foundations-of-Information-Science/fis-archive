Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thinking on the cellular foundations of 'meaning' does not necessarily mean 
<br />
that there is a stumbling block of complexity that at the time being cannot 
<br />
be crossed. Even if the two extremes ---molecular details awfully networked 
<br />
in every direction, and the absence of a viable 'dynamic' whole scheme for 
<br />
the cell-- are rather obscure yet, there are intermediate territories where 
<br />
one can point to some cellular 'doctrine' of meaning elaboration by the cell.
<br />
<p>Years ago I pointed out that filling-in the occurring 'functional voids' 
<br />
provoked by the incoming signal, was the central response of the cellular 
<br />
productive machinery, involving both synthesis of proteins and their 
<br />
degradation. However, putting this approach in some formal track 
<br />
('informationally') was not easy at all. I much thank ideas received from 
<br />
Shu-Kun's papers about mol. recog. &amp; entropy of mixing, and also a very 
<br />
elegant message I could not answer from Loet (fis: 20.12.03. I have pasted 
<br />
it below) so that a conceptual road  to approach cellular processing of 
<br />
signals looms.
<br />
<p>The whole speculation would combine Robert Rosen's dynamic scheme on 
<br />
'forcing' and enzyme networks, with SK approach, Loet's and my functional 
<br />
voids idea (handled by a population of enzymes working as 'molecular 
<br />
autiomata'). It looks too heterogeneous, but at least one gets a formal 
<br />
idea on how COMMUNICATION with the environment relates to changes in the 
<br />
advancement of a cycle, MEANING thus, derived of the entrenchment between 
<br />
GENERATIVE and STRUCTURAL forms of information whose unending processes 
<br />
weave and unweave the fabric of life.
<br />
<p>A big question would be whether philosophies germane to the above could be 
<br />
applied to 'meaning' in other informational realms. Even to establish a 
<br />
natural background on mentality and the conceptual realm.
<br />
<p>best
<br />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />
<p><p>Dear Pedro and colleagues,
<br />
I take the liberty to fight this argument all the way since I wish it to be 
<br />
correctly understood. I agree with much of what you say and I appreciate 
<br />
the example of the enzyme regulating the flux efficiently. However, I think 
<br />
that it is important not only to distinguish between the flux of resources 
<br />
and the entropy that it generates, but also between the thermodynamic and 
<br />
probabilistic entropy that is generated by this flux. Thus, there would be 
<br />
three systems of reference (theories) in the case of your example.
<br />
The distinction is important because we are interested in information 
<br />
theory. Historically, authors from the side of physics and chemistry have 
<br />
attempted to subsume probabilistic entropy under thermodynamic entropy as a 
<br />
special case or a little fraction that can be fully understood using 
<br />
(chemical) physics. The argument becomes then often unclear because the 
<br />
authors do not specify the system of reference other than as &quot;the&quot; system. 
<br />
With &quot;the&quot; system, of course, they mean &quot;nature&quot;. (One can show that the 
<br />
probabilistic entropy is smaller than the thermodynamic entropy times the 
<br />
Boltzmann-contant.)
<br />
Information theory however provides us with an entropy calculus that is 
<br />
first independent of the system of reference. Therefore we can also study 
<br />
the probabilistic entropy in an economic system. Whenever something is 
<br />
communicated a probabilistic entropy is generated by this redistribution. 
<br />
For example, in this exchange of emails we can count the threads, the 
<br />
mails, the words, etc., and compute in each dimension how much 
<br />
(probabilistic) entropy is generated. This is straightforward and it does 
<br />
not have anything to do with the thermodynamic entropy produced by or the 
<br />
energy needed for all the systems which carry the exchange. (One can 
<br />
compute a thermodynamic entropy of the exchange of message, but that would 
<br />
not inform us at all about the exchange.)
<br />
I am sure that you are able to elaborate this for your example of the 
<br />
enzyme. The question one has to raise first when one studies the 
<br />
probabilistic entropy of a system is: what does the system redistribute 
<br />
when it communicates? This provides us with the specification of an 
<br />
hypothesis. (George Spencer Brown would call this an observation = a 
<br />
distinction + an identification, but that may be confusing.) Second, one 
<br />
can ask how one can indicate the communication. This provides us with an 
<br />
operationalization. Thirdly, the measurement can inform us about the 
<br />
relative quality of the hypothesis. A system which operates in terms of 
<br />
energy redistribution can then be considered as a special case that 
<br />
requires a special theory (e.g., physics). But the one system cannot 
<br />
reduced to the other without a specific theory (that can be tested!).
