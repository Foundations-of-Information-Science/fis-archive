Dear FIS discussants,
<br />
<p>I have an informational question about these two references:
<br />
<p>(1)  Ramon Ferrer i Cancho and Richard V. Sole, 2003. Least effort and the
<br />
origins of scaling in human language. PNAS, vol. 100, no. 3. pp: 788-791.
<br />
&nbsp;www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0335980100
<br />
<p>(2)  Ulanowicz, R.E. and W.F. Wolff. 1991. Ecosystem flow networks: Loaded
<br />
dice? Math. Biosci 103:45-68.
<br />
<p>(1) is about explaining Zifp's law, while (2) proposes that the connection
<br />
weights in real ecological networks are distributed according to a stable
<br />
non-Gaussian distribution, such as the Cauchy distribution (aka the
<br />
Lorentzian distribution, aka the Student-t distribution with one degree of
<br />
freedom).
<br />
<p>(For more a definition of the Cauchy distribution, see
<br />
<a href="../../mathworld.wolfram.com/CauchyDistribution.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CauchyDistribution.html</a> )
<br />
<p>(1) and (2) are wonderfully written papers and I found them both fascinating
<br />
in their own right.  But is there any connection between them?
<br />
<p>I understand that stable non-Gaussian distributions are long-tailed in the
<br />
sense that they have infinite variances, and that they play the role of
<br />
attractors for sums of independent random variables that have distributions
<br />
with the same long-tail properties.  The Gaussian distribution is a limiting
<br />
case of a stable non-Gaussian distribution--it is an attactor for a large
<br />
class of distributions that have finite variances, as is made precise in
<br />
various versions of the Central Limit Theorem.
<br />
<p>(For a relatively short proof of the Central Limit Theorem, see
<br />
<a href="../../mathworld.wolfram.com/CentralLimitTheorem.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CentralLimitTheorem.html</a> )
<br />
<p>In other words, stable non-Gaussian distributions (which have infinite
<br />
variances) violate the conditions of the Central Limit Theorem.  They have
<br />
their own &quot;central limit theorems&quot;, as was proven 50 years ago:
<br />
<p>Gnedenko, B. V. and A. N. Kolmogorov (1954) Limit Distributions for Sums of
<br />
Independent Random Variables, Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley.
<br />
<p>The only connection I know between power laws and stable non-Gaussian
<br />
distributions (and the distributions in their basins of attraction) that is
<br />
that the tails are characterized in the limit by a power law of a certain
<br />
kind.  (I was aware the Pareto distributions have such properties, but I was
<br />
unaware that the log-normal distribution is included in the same class.)
<br />
<p>Natural language texts have been found to obey Zifp's law, which says that
<br />
when you rank words in the text from the highest frequency to the lowest,
<br />
the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank.  E.g., the
<br />
top ranked word has a frequency proportion to 1/1, the second ranked word
<br />
has a frequency proportional to 1/2, and so on.  I suppose it can be viewed
<br />
as a probability function.  But then the random variable (word rank) is not
<br />
like the random variables in stable non-Gaussian distributions--those random
<br />
variables have an unbounded domain that extends to plus infinity.  The
<br />
unboundedness of the domain is necessary for asymptotic properties of the
<br />
tails to be well defined.  If the number of words is n, then the rank of any
<br />
word must is less than or equal to n.  So, the domain of the variable is
<br />
bounded.  Therefore, Zifp's &quot;probability function&quot; has no asymptotic
<br />
properties!
<br />
<p>In other words, I don't see any deep connection between Zifp's function and
<br />
long-tailed distribution or a power law distributions such as the Cauchy
<br />
distribution.  (I seem to remember someone else asking similar questions,
<br />
but I haven't seen any answers.)
<br />
<p>Here is my positive only positive suggestion:  Perhaps Zifp's law can be
<br />
viewed as a *sampling* distribution taken from a long-tailed distribution?
<br />
Samples have finite variances even when sampled from distributions with
<br />
infinite variances.  So, maybe there is a connection?  Does anyone know?
