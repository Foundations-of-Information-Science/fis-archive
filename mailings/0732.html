Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>I am replying to some past messages:
<br />
<p>(from Ted)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here we have the most basic characterization of the FIS problem from my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective. I firmly believe, with Pedro, that the problem is that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world is not at all logical. I presume, but am not sure he would go as far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as me in believing that logic is an imperfect human invention. I wonder 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what the FIS agenda is thought to be by anyone who assumes logic is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow embedded in the mechanics of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Our old, flawed notion of information is conflated with notions of &quot;truth&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and &quot;facts.&quot; Our new notion (who knows?) may best be characterized by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notions of effect (and cause, leading to issues of time). I thought that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what we were struggling with.
</em><br />
<p>Yes, Ted, I get along on that issue with you. And also with the limitations 
<br />
of the FIS enterprise just to level 4 that you mention in the next message. 
<br />
Perhaps I would not qualify the human logics as 'imperfect' but 
<br />
as  'prosthetic'. I tend to consider them as neurologically grounded 
<br />
strategies which have been superimposed onto the sequentially organized 
<br />
language system (symbolic realm) so as to make it coherent with the 
<br />
unending closure of the 'action'/'perception' cycle that permeates the 
<br />
functioning of the vertebrate nervous system. Other species have peculiar 
<br />
logicizations, and rudimentary symbol management too. I much coincide with 
<br />
a paragraph of Jerry about this:
<br />
<p>(now, my whimsical Eudora does not let me paste as in Ted's...)
<br />
<p>&quot;The deep intertwining, interweaving and interlacing of the logic 
<br />
structures of science and the logic structures of mathematics are mutually 
<br />
re-enforcing toward one another.  New observations in science stimulate new 
<br />
observations in mathematics and vice versa. The cumulative success of these 
<br />
relationships is among the foundational pillars of the informational 
<br />
sciences such as FIS. From the perspective of the concepts of &quot;Organic 
<br />
Communication&quot;, I note the deep similarity between the conceptual dynamics 
<br />
of organic communication in living systems and the corresponding conceptual 
<br />
dynamics of generating logical communications.&quot;
<br />
<p>My contention is that those similarities are somehow grouped into family 
<br />
resemblances, depending on the problems and problem-solving resources 
<br />
existing in each living-related realm (eg, the tetrad: molecules, cells, 
<br />
individuals, firms).  Putting clarity and order into such empirical and 
<br />
abstract commonalities emerging on a vertical dimension of organization is 
<br />
at the very center of the fis enterprise... so the much needed 
<br />
communication among the different explorations by the variety of scientific 
<br />
communities involved in the goal. Helas, a central problem that also 
<br />
impinges in my previous comments (above) on logics is the lack of a central 
<br />
theory of the neurosciences, really making sense of the dynamics of our 
<br />
cognition. It is a very strategic void, and a fantastic source of 
<br />
interdisciplinary confusion.
<br />
<p>Finally, there are two paragraphs, below, from Edwina's, where she 
<br />
reiterates the all-embracing reach of her theorizations.
<br />
<p>&quot;I'm saying that all reality, which includes the physico-chemical,
<br />
biological and socioconceptual realms, operates within logic, by
<br />
which I mean long term pragmatic patterns of relations. All realms
<br />
operate by establishing normative patterns of relations. Those are
<br />
what I mean by logic...
<br />
My theories - I wouldn't call them 'religious decisions', for that
<br />
would suggest that my theories are arrrived at only by revelation,
<br />
and are not testable by either rational or empirical means. I hope
<br />
that my theories are testable by both&quot;.
<br />
<p>I have just read in Nature an interesting paper on a new field: 
<br />
sonoluminisce. After long years of intense work, the authors have achieved 
<br />
that a sound wave in liquid water finally collapses into a brief 
<br />
luminiscence glow. En passant, they mention the fantastic experimental and 
<br />
theoretical complexity of their emerging field--up to 11 different 
<br />
scientific and engineering disciplines are involved! How can one put 
<br />
harmoniously and efficienty all those bodies of knowledge together? 
<br />
Practising scientists will understand me very well when I was referring to 
<br />
'complexity' and 'elegance' vs. endless logical statements in my message 
<br />
days ago. The point I now take home (related to the 'relevance problem' I 
<br />
also mentioned about the relationship between multiple disciplines at work) 
<br />
is that hard work and not intellectual overconfidence is what keeps the 
<br />
common enterprise of science running. Sincerely, I do not consider that the 
<br />
above type of unbounded 'theorizations' fall under the umbrella of natural 
<br />
science at all. But I desire its author very good luck in her enterprise.
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
