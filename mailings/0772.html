Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>In this email, I respond to several recent posts (pedro, John, Terry) 
<br />
of interest.  This semester is unusually busy and I am disappointed 
<br />
that I lack the time to enter into these topics at greater depth.
<br />
<p>Pedro:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From the perspective of the natural sciences, I do not understand 
<br />
your post on &quot;Doctrine of Limitation.&quot;  I am particularly puzzled by 
<br />
the usage of the term Doctrine?  Is this an essential part of your 
<br />
view or is it merely a substitution for another term, such as Law?
<br />
I am equally puzzled by the term, Limitation.   Is a limitation being 
<br />
imposed?  If so, what is being imposed and who is acting as the 
<br />
imposer?
<br />
<p>The discussion you provide in the support of the Doctrine addresses a 
<br />
significant number of relatable ideas but the nature of these 
<br />
relations is not clear to me.  For example, would it be appropriate 
<br />
to consider the role of history in relating the function of the 
<br />
central nervous system?  Should the role of neuronal transmitters as 
<br />
communicators  *between* cells be considered?  This introduces a new 
<br />
issue:   the logic of &quot;betweenness&quot; in contrast with simpler 
<br />
classical binary logic.  I do not understand the issues with regard 
<br />
to electric fields as even a simple microbe sustains a membrane 
<br />
potential.
<br />
<p>Underlying these issues is the question of complexity - if we choose 
<br />
to simplify  our descriptions of complex behaviors by removing the 
<br />
complexity, what have we gained?
<br />
<p>Terry asks:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; Is Information a Disease?&quot;
<br />
<p>and then describes the consequences of various forms of professional 
<br />
communications.
<br />
<p>Would it be helpful to first ask: What is a disease?
<br />
And then enquire as to the nature of the sources of the disease?
<br />
<p>Many physicians believe that diseases are the consequence of a 
<br />
particular etiology - a particular sequence of processes that link an 
<br />
individual to its surroundings.  Terry apparently acknowledges this 
<br />
when she writes:
<br />
&quot;All depends on the specifics and psychodynamics of the case.&quot;
<br />
<p>John writes (Sept. 20 post):
<br />
<p>&quot;This is where PI meets Philosophy of Language. The separation of meaning from
<br />
grammar (Carnap, Chomsky et al) and from communication theory 
<br />
(Shannon and Weaver) has pretty well thrown out
<br />
the baby information with the bathwater of semantics. Hopefully PI 
<br />
will revisit some of these abandoned agendas.
<br />
<p>Connectionists like David Chalmers have conveniently created the 
<br />
notion of 'information spaces and states' -
<br />
<p>'Physics requires information states but cares only about their 
<br />
relations, not their intrinsic nature;
<br />
phenomenology requires information states but cares only about their 
<br />
intrinsic nature..
<br />
Experience is information from the inside; physics is information 
<br />
from the outside.'
<br />
(The Conscious Mind p. 305)&quot;.
<br />
<p>I believe John's questions deserve very serious consideration.
<br />
At issue is source of the concept of information.
<br />
Does the concept of information depend on communication?
<br />
<p>As John notes, the separation of meaning is not restricted to grammar 
<br />
and Shannon information theory.  Most philosophers of mathematics 
<br />
claim that no meaning is attached to mathematical rules or 
<br />
structures.   By way of contrast, the language of chemistry and 
<br />
chemical grammars are meaningful - a matter of common experience.
<br />
<p>If one assumes that formally, &quot;information&quot; has no meaning, then one 
<br />
must turn elsewhere to identify the source of meaning and 
<br />
communication.
<br />
As a logical parallel, I would point out that the nature of entropy 
<br />
(as a physical phenomenon) depends of the co-existence of temperature 
<br />
and energy.
<br />
In bare bone terms:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you get nothing from nothing;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you get something from something.
<br />
<p>Or, to place these notions in a more formal setting:
<br />
If the transfer of information generates new meanings for the 
<br />
recipient, what are the sources of the generating functions?
<br />
To what extent are the generating functions for human communication 
<br />
intrinsic to the nature of being human?
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
