<p>Coming from a different persuasion, I have to ask if Arne's remarks  
<br />
apply only to one kind of informational context드n &quot;experiential&quot;  
<br />
one.  If I shift the focus to a biological context, where genes are  
<br />
replicated and transcribed as digital information, I see no need  
<br />
whatsoever for the human mind to project a psycho-philosophical  
<br />
principle onto such non-human aspects of nature.  Maybe we are still  
<br />
reeling from the Anthropic Principle.  When we speak of information,  
<br />
in my opinion, we too often stray into this &quot;experiential&quot; territory  
<br />
and ignore other natural communicators that don't have experiences.   
<br />
So, I want to know how THEY are communicated in space and time.  From  
<br />
my perspective, I might see genomes as confederations of selfish  
<br />
genes and their alleles든ntirely digital in their domain듪perating by  
<br />
some vague principle that may also apply elsewhere, perhaps even  
<br />
gravitationally and quantum mechanically.
<br />
<p>But a few still need to see things hierarchically, as if Mind or God  
<br />
sits on top, pulling along everything that occurs from moment to  
<br />
moment in space and time.  Why should this be a first principle?  Why  
<br />
couldn't some argument of parallel universes provide a better  
<br />
explanation on what information actually is and how it is  
<br />
communicated in nature.  Sadly, life in nature remains an  
<br />
embarrassing enigma for biologists, physicists, and informologists  
<br />
alike.  No hierarchical principle will ever take us to a clear  
<br />
understanding of a biological kind of life that, for billions of  
<br />
years, needed no &quot;personal awareness&quot; by anyone in order to  
<br />
continuously communication genetic information and evolve all sorts  
<br />
of organismic &quot;messages.&quot;  And those ethereal digits outlived their  
<br />
fleshy expressions by millions and millions of years.
<br />
<p>We are like astronomers before Hubble who observed the Milky Way with  
<br />
a deep sense of mystery든vidence, perhaps, of heavenly meddling듯ntil  
<br />
the concept of galaxies was clearly understood.  Suddenly there was  
<br />
no longer any need for hierarchical models that invoke, tacitly or  
<br />
not, a higher Communicator.  For me, at least, not a lot of useful  
<br />
stuff comes from the glorification of &quot;experience&quot; and the  
<br />
castigation of &quot;dualism.&quot;  Something very important is still unknown  
<br />
about what the &quot;information of life&quot; really is들f it is not digitally  
<br />
genetic드nd I am betting that when it is discovered it will NOT be  
<br />
some kind of an &quot;experience.&quot;
<br />
<p>Thanks always for these interesting discussions.
