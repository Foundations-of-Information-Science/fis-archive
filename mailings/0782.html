<p>
Jerry,
<br />
Please find here some answers to your post.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Colleagues:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This response addresses several issues related to information and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular, I respond to Chistophe's and Rafael's posts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I proposed on September 28, in an extension of John Holgate post of Sept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 20.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;As John notes, the separation of meaning is not restricted to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grammar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;and Shannon information theory. Most philosophers of mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;claim that no meaning is attached to mathematical rules or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;structures. By way of contrast, the language of chemistry and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;chemical grammars are meaningful - a matter of common experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;If one assumes that formally, &quot;information&quot; has no meaning, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;must turn elsewhere to identify the source of meaning and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;As a logical parallel, I would point out that the nature of entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;(as a physical phenomenon) depends of the co-existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;and energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;In bare bone terms:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;you get nothing from nothing;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;you get something from something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chistrophe Menart writes on Sept. 29, 2002:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The two points brought up by John and Jerry underline aspects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;our discussion that could deserve further developments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;1) Separation of meaning from information:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I strongly concur that these topics need further development.  At 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue is the nature of relation between the terms &quot;communication&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a community based activity and information as a reductionistic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of isolationism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As already written in a previous post, I feel that a meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;cannot exist without an information carrying it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your feelings are important.  But how do you relate these feeling to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful communication with colleagues?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
This precise feeling about meaning and information is the subject 
<br />
of the post, which is a communication with colleagues. Communication
<br />
uses information transfer (voice, email transfer, signs, ..).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In other words, a meaning is an information, a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(Information being the component of a signal, a variation of energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Ex: sound, light, chemical element, protein,...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, what are the other components of a signal if other than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information?  What else exists that is placed with information to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give the fullness to meaningful?  In particular, can you spatially 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate the transport of information from the generating functions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creating meaning?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
All components of a signal are information. But an information is 
<br />
not always meaningful. Only information that has been produced by 
<br />
an Meaning Genarator System (MGS) is meaningful (and there can be 
<br />
an infinity of MGSs). The meaning is not &quot;something else&quot; added to 
<br />
information that makes it becoming meaningful. The meaningfullness
<br />
of an information comes from the origin of the information. If 
<br />
the information has been produced by a system that has no constraint
<br />
to satisfy, then the information cannot be meaningful. 
<br />
The meaningful information is meanningful relatively to the 
<br />
constraint S of the MGS (we should speak about &quot;meaningful (S) 
<br />
information&quot;, or &quot;meaning (S)&quot;). And a meaningful information 
<br />
transmitted to other systems will be able to participate to an 
<br />
action satisfying the constrain S only if the receiver system 
<br />
is submitted to the same constraint S.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In our brains, mental states are related to variation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;neurotransmitter patterns. The meanings in our brains are based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;information status in neurons (understanding that a lot is to be done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;this field, specially regarding the nature of consciousness).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find this paragraph blurs together several distinctions.  Brains 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are anatomical components of our bodies, brains have biochemical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components and an underlying genetic basis for the generating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not understand how the concept of a &quot;mental state&quot; relates to these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; facts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The postulate that &quot;information status in neurons&quot; exists is equally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unclear to me.  Perhaps you could relate these terms to principles of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
For me, &quot;Mental state&quot; is an expression used to name a state in 
<br />
our brain corresponding to what we understand as a representation, 
<br />
a desire, an intention, an emotion, ... It is not possible today 
<br />
to relate these mental states to some precise activity of neuronal
<br />
patterns, but we can consider that &quot;there is some relation&quot;.
<br />
Regarding &quot;information status in neurons&quot;, I mean that neurons can 
<br />
have different status of activity. These differences in energy are 
<br />
information (and the difference per se is information in the Shannon
<br />
sense).
<br />
About relating these terms to principles of communication, indeed 
<br />
neurons communicate together and allow the organism to communicate 
<br />
with the outside world.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But this does not mean that all information is meaningful. Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;information are meaningless, but most information can participate to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;creation of meaningful information Ex: Noise from thunderstorm is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a meaningful information per se. But this noise in going to participate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the creation of a meaning in our brain. For instance, the created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;will be &quot;rain is comming&quot;. And this meaning will generate an action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;look for shelter&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This example hardly supports your thesis unless one assumes that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;information&quot; is tightly coupled to human values and utilitarian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns of belief.  &quot;Thunder&quot; has quantitative physical qualities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (intensity as a function of duration and frequency) that communicate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a great deal of information.  As Wordsworth said, the ear can not but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to hear, the eye can not but to see.  We are coupled to nature 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *NATURE!* in an intimate and detailed manner that is rooted in human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history, not just conceptual abstractions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
This example of noise from thunderstorm creating a meaning wants 
<br />
to illustrate a simple meaning genaration. This is why we take only
<br />
the noise as information incident on the MGS. 
<br />
But obviously &quot;thunder&quot; communicates a great deal of information that
<br />
can generate many meanings (lightning, wind, flood, Zeus, power, 
<br />
fear, ..). But many of these meanings are related to the domain of 
<br />
human psychism. And at the current level of analysis of &quot;meaning&quot; 
<br />
with the MGS approach, it is preferable to avoid involving human 
<br />
psychism. Because we do not really know what human mind is, and 
<br />
consequetly we are not able to identify the corresponding constraints 
<br />
(which are key for the MGS).
<br />
The result is that we cannot today define a global MGS for human. 
<br />
The best we can do is to limit the usage of MGS for human to very 
<br />
simple cases (i.e. closer to basic life than to performances of human).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;2) Origin of meaning:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If we agree that a meaning is a meaningful information, we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;for the generation of this information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As some already know, I feel there is a way to modelize a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;Meaning Generator System&quot; (MGS) as being a system submitted to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;constraint that has to be satisfied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I strongly concur that we must examine the origin of meanings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The concept of a &quot;Meaning Generator System&quot; (MGS)&quot; could perhaps be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why introduce the notion of restrictions on freedoms in order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Nature is.  Why should nature be denied freedom in the process of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are these constraints intended to give a physical gloss to the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of MGS?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
The base of the MGS is that a meaning generation needs a constraint
<br />
to be satisfied. The purpose of the meaningful information is to 
<br />
initiate the implementation of an action that will satisfy the 
<br />
constraint. 
<br />
There are some systems where the constraints are simple (&quot;to survive&quot; 
<br />
for a simple animal). For other systems, the constraints can be very
<br />
complex (group survival vs individual survival, pleasure principle vs 
<br />
principle of reality, limit anxiety,...). The restriction of freedom 
<br />
that you associate with the constraint corresponds to the case of humans
<br />
where there is free will. And, as said above, we should be very carefull
<br />
in using the MGS for humans, as we do not know the constraints 
<br />
applicable to human (Perhaps this point has not been stated clearly 
<br />
enough in the FIS 2002 paper).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the notion of &quot;organic communication&quot; I presuppose that intrinsic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a living system is a chemical dynamic that generates change, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such change is intrinsic to the life cycle of the organism. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Information entering the system changes the intrinsic dynamic in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific manner.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this view close or distant from your view of MGS?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Your view is close to the MGS if we consider that the changes in 
<br />
intrinsic dynamic as introduced by an incident information can have 
<br />
some connection with the constraint of the living system (impact it's 
<br />
survival or reproduction conditions).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christophe responds:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I feel we can say that it is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a question about a difference of complexity than about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; difference of nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Would you agree ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And Rafael responds:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yes, but the difference does not just come from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progammer, it comes basically from the kind of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a robot is (in case it is not a *flesh* one... at least...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; JLRC responds:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christophe chooses to introduce the ill-defined notion of complexity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a means to bridge the distinction between mechanical communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and organic communication.  It is not clear to me why this term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (complexity) resolves anything.  Communication has the potential to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relate various ideas and concepts about information and meaning.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am skeptical that the term &quot;complexity&quot; has an analogous potential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolving power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Yes, I agree that the usage I made of the term &quot;complexity&quot; is a 
<br />
bit too easy. As answered to Rafael, I am implicitly considering 
<br />
there that in some future we may understand well enough the 
<br />
constraints of human so that MGS for human would be well defined. 
<br />
But this is far from being the case today. So my wording is 
<br />
misleading, and &quot;it is more a question about ... &quot; should be 
<br />
replaced by &quot;it could be more a question about ...&quot;. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On a practical level, one distinction between robotics and living 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisms is the capability of living organisms to sustain an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic by purposeful acquisitions from the external world.  This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coupled with an evolutionary potential for organic change.  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract Platonic world of mathematics generates many images of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type proposed by Christophe.  How are such images validated?  or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reified?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The data collected by the robot can not be placed in correspondence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the meaning acquired by a living organism, can it?  Without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; success, I have sought such a quantitative translation for more than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two decades.   Christophe, if you feel that you can construct such a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspondence relation, I would delighted if you would help me learn 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your method of construction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
With the MGS structure, we do have a meaning generated by the robot
<br />
(it is an internaly produced information, not a collected data). 
<br />
And there is also a meaning generated by the living organism. Can
<br />
we put them in correspondence ? I would say yes for the meaning 
<br />
generation as per the MGS, but no for all that is around it.
<br />
We can understand that a similar MGS can be acting in the robot and
<br />
in the living organism (similar constraint, similar reception of
<br />
incident information, similar generation of meaningful information).
<br />
But beyond this status, things are totaly different in the robot and
<br />
in the living organism. 
<br />
So there is correspondence only for this very limited meaning 
<br />
generation about the precise and simple fact of being related 
<br />
to a similar constraint. But beyond this level of analysis, I am 
<br />
like you: no way to put in correspondance a robot and a human.
<br />
And, as we already talked about, I think that all this question is
<br />
related to our ignorance about the nature of human mind. We do 
<br />
not know what mind is. So let's accept that it is imposssible to
<br />
establish a correspondance with what we don't know.
