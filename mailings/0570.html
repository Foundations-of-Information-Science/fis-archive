<p>
Dear Karl and Jerry,
<br />
<p>sorry for the delay: I like very much Pedro's rule! Let me just make a few (historical) remarks on the question
<br />
'what is a thing?' (I follow Heidegger's &quot;The Question Concerning the Thing&quot;, a lecture of the year
<br />
1935/36 on Kant). 
<br />
<p>Aristotle made a difference between natural things ('physika') and 'artificial
<br />
things' ('poiumena'). Natural scientists study natural things or 'phainomena' (that, which
<br />
appears'). Newton writes (Principia, III, regula IV): &quot;in philosophia experimentale propositiones ex
<br />
phaenomenis per inductionem collectae non obstantibus contrariis hypothesibus pro veris aut
<br />
accurate aut quamproxime haberi debent, donec alia occurrerint phaenomena, per quae aut 
<br />
accuratiores reddedantur aut exceptionibus abnoxiae&quot; (roughly: experimental scientists take their
<br />
measure from the phaenomena, and try to come near to them (with their propositions), as far 
<br />
as there are no other phenomena that contradict these propositions). 
<br />
<p>As you can imagine, the concept of 'phaenomena' for Aristotle and for Newton is not the same, for intance
<br />
with regard to motion which is dependent, for Aristotle, on the nature of the 'physical things'
<br />
('physika somata'), while according to Newton: &quot;corpus omne, quod a viribus impressis non
<br />
cogitur, uniformiter in directum moventur.&quot;  &quot;Corpus omne&quot; i.e. no distinction between earthly
<br />
and heavenly things, no primacy of circular movement etc. Such a 'corpus', as Heidegger remarks,
<br />
does no exist. It is an invention (Galilei writes: &quot;mobile... mente concipio omni secluso impedimento')
<br />
and this is exactly what old and new concepts of things are: a theoretical (or practical) projection that allows
<br />
us to see 'things' in this or in other way (and to conceive a world). The consequence (!) of 
<br />
this modern view is that we can (need to) apply a 'measure' that is the same for 
<br />
all things, and this measure are numbers. Modernity makes a 'twist' from the 'phainomena' 
<br />
to the 'subject' ('mente concipio') and this movement leads to Descartes' ego 
<br />
and to Kant's distinction between 'things in themselves' and 'things as they  appear' 
<br />
(according to the 'measure' of the subject...). 
<br />
<p>The Scholastic definiton of truth was:  veritas est adaequatio intellectus et rei, i.e.
<br />
the measure (commensuratio, convenientia) for human reason were things in
<br />
themselves (as conceived by God...)
<br />
<p>Modern science according to Kant (following Newton) is restricted to 
<br />
nature as an 'island' (Kant's famous metaphor), 'the land of truth' in the middle
<br />
of a stormy ocean (of 'appearences'). Kant (and Newton) project or 'cast' appearences
<br />
according to (epistemological) principles. Things become 'objects' (of possible
<br />
experience). But Kant makes a leap behind and beyond 'objects' as he appeals
<br />
to the 'givenness' as primordial to our knowledge activity. Matter and form, and thus
<br />
IN-FORMATION are now (partly) on the side of the subject. We are, in fact,
<br />
conditioned (as knowers) by things but we can trascend them, otherwise we would not
<br />
be able to conceive them in different ways. But more basically: we can not only make
<br />
a difference between different things, as well as between ways of conceiving
<br />
things but (possibilitating these differences) we can make a difference between
<br />
thing and 'no-thing'!... And this is, indeed, I believe, a major capability of our brain...
<br />
<p>Which is the (right) measure of things? maybe 'no-thing'? Or put it positively:
<br />
it seems as if we can 'cast' things in their being in different ways (for instance as
<br />
a combination of matter, energy and... information) and it seems as if they 
<br />
correspond to (some of) our (ontological) castings. As far as I can see we are
<br />
now casting being(s) within the horizon of digitality. I speak therefore about
<br />
'digital ontology' (not: digital metaphysics, which would mean that we make a
<br />
strong assertion about the 'nature' of things, instead of a 'weak casting'...)
<br />
<p>Is information a thing? I remember Hilary Putnam's &quot;Representation and
<br />
Reality&quot; where he tells a nice story about being in a room two persons, a lamp,
<br />
a book,  a pencil and a desk, and one asks to the other: 'how many things 
<br />
are in this room?'  Four, of course, is the answer. Well: what about the pages
<br />
of the book? and the hole of your nose? and what about all elementary 
<br />
particles and ... what about you and me? are  we 'things'?&quot; 
<br />
<p>Well the story is just the show what Putnam calls the
<br />
'porosity' of human language (and this insight allows him to criticize his
<br />
own former 'belief' in AI...). Probably we should think about linking 
<br />
different concepts of information in the sense of Wittgenstein's family
<br />
ressemblances... (In German I like to say: &quot;wir sind nicht alle ganz dicht&quot;
<br />
which means (also) that we are not completely 'normal' or 'closed'
<br />
<p>Sorry, this is becoming too long (it is late in the evening)
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
