<p>
But we must try hard because it seems that the spirit of 2002 as 
<br />
culmination of the warring 20th century refuses to abandon us, as he 
<br />
or she or it really enjoys in using humans for assuring his or her or 
<br />
its more and more grandiose festivities. In fact this spirit has not 
<br />
being able to convince any other of the species - neither those that 
<br />
in the past did not manage to survive nor all the other that exist at 
<br />
present, condemned to become endangered ones - to recognize him or 
<br />
her or it.
<br />
<p>Meanwhile the New Year 2003 could not wait any longer after failing 
<br />
to avoid to be started   o f f i c i a l l y   several weeks ago when 
<br />
billions of people assumed, at least for a while, that their problems 
<br />
and worries would necessarily disappear through the exchange of good 
<br />
wishes:
<br />
<p>Greetings to all for the new year!
<br />
Yours, for a happy New Year!
<br />
feliç any nou!
<br />
Bonne anné!
<br />
Sincerest wishes the New Year
<br />
I wish you a Happy, Healthy and Peaceful New Year
<br />
¡¡¡Feliz Año!!!
<br />
Best wishes for the new year
<br />
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
<br />
PROSPERO AÑO NUEVO
<br />
<p>Pretty soon most of our congeners who have had not other option than 
<br />
to enjoy the benefits of the continuously super modernized 
<br />
globalization - being it generated by the dynamics of our magnificent 
<br />
civilization - realized that everything aggravates. Being this 
<br />
globalization conceived and implemented for the sake of economic 
<br />
progress supported by more and more technology encouraged through 
<br />
scientific work funded for such a purpose it sounds incredible to 
<br />
notice how fast is growing the globalization of poverty, misery, 
<br />
unemployment, criminality, corruption, hypocrisy, frivolity,... 
<br />
Fortunately this globalization seems to be increasingly comprehensive 
<br />
with the urgent needs of Homo sapiens sapiens because its own 
<br />
dynamics may generate the necessary conditions for the manifestation 
<br />
hunger, malnutrition, pandemic, famine that may lead to the emergence 
<br />
of a global starvation that will reduce efficiently the proliferation 
<br />
of humans.
<br />
<p>During several years, due almost evidently to my ingenious 
<br />
ingenuousness I have dared to believe in some dissident thoughts of 
<br />
Bertalanffy, Boulding, Rapoport and few others who have claimed that 
<br />
humans are potentially capable of learning to behave consistently 
<br />
after realizing how wrongly has grown the homosphere.
<br />
<p>&quot;We know and control physical forces only too well, biological forces 
<br />
tolerably well, and social forces not at all. If therefore, we could 
<br />
have a well developed science of social systems, it would be the way 
<br />
out of the chaos and impending destruction of the present world.&quot; 
<br />
(Bertalanffy)
<br />
<p>Therefore I have written that the human society may cope with its 
<br />
difficulty using consistently: systems thinking and cybernetic 
<br />
interpretation of the surrounding terrestrial reality recognized 
<br />
through information structured with data perceived by our senses, 
<br />
though inevitably biased by our civilized assumptions. I have also 
<br />
mentioned that being human nature essentially gregarious most humans 
<br />
may consciously develop their co-operative attitudes for building 
<br />
purposefully a humanitarian civilization.
<br />
<p>Besides I have commented that both the pragmatic spontaneity and the 
<br />
spontaneous pragmatism that made possible our earlier ancestors 
<br />
during their nomadic life to develop what became the human features 
<br />
are not longer suitable for organizing from now onward the survival 
<br />
of our species. Why? Evidently the pragmatic performance of most of 
<br />
our congeners (elites, medium classes and masses) have unconsciously 
<br />
created an absurd and contradictory homosphere that continuously 
<br />
disrupts our suffering biosphere
<br />
<p>In addition I expressed &quot;that planning at present a better future 
<br />
makes INDISPENSABLE to comprehend better and better the past by means 
<br />
of a scientific examination of the events that happened and 
<br />
determined the trajectory for humankind&quot; for helping the scientific 
<br />
community to conceive &quot;...a reasonable or humanitarian way forward.&quot; 
<br />
I even argued that this &quot;approach must allow everybody to recognize 
<br />
what kind of systems were constituted, what sort of feed-back and 
<br />
feed-forward interactions were consciously or unconsciously 
<br />
implemented, whether the information employed was truthful enough, 
<br />
what misinformation was purposefully invented, whether the 
<br />
organization of actions was sufficiently ethical.&quot;
<br />
<p>Fallacious assumption of mine in case &quot;...systemics is about the 
<br />
interactionings that are happening in the present&quot;; in case I cannot 
<br />
demonstrate that our past - created by a causality composed by 
<br />
numerous interactions is part of our reality as it has been inserted 
<br />
in our present.
<br />
<p>In the case that it were frankly erroneous, therefore forbidden, to 
<br />
consider real the ideas that come to our mind in order to organize 
<br />
our immediate perspective and our long term panorama located in the 
<br />
future, the answer to &quot;Can anything that isn't happening now be 
<br />
considered real?&quot; is NO.
<br />
<p>I will cogitate about this idea, despite it might be no real by 
<br />
definition though it would be necessary for allowing me to recognize 
<br />
what is the &quot;BIG system at work here&quot; on Earth and in the Universe. 
<br />
Subsequently I will necessarily accept that &quot;The Universe found one 
<br />
way that would work, and has been using that one way and variations 
<br />
of it&quot;
<br />
<p>Such idea is definitely attractive. It allows any individual to live 
<br />
happily during the few days, months and years that were assigned to 
<br />
him or her by that &quot;One WHOLE&quot; without being worried at all whether 
<br />
he or she will die by actions organized and implemented by other or 
<br />
due to natural causes.
<br />
<p>It would become even fascinating to create a new kind of education 
<br />
for helping the &quot;One WHOLE&quot; to accomplish more efficiently what must 
<br />
be done. An education designed exclusively for warfare. An education 
<br />
for allowing the emergence of few humans well trained as evil tyrants 
<br />
ready to use humanitarian but also effective means for annihilation. 
<br />
Indeed the danger of the human proliferation will be systematically 
<br />
reduced through the establishment of a Nobel Prize and other similar 
<br />
awards, rewards, trophies,... for despots, oppressors, dictators but 
<br />
also soldiers and scientists capable to accomplish in reality what 
<br />
Napoleon only did partially though he asked Metternich in 1813 &quot;What 
<br />
are the lives of a million men such as I?&quot;
<br />
<p>However fascinating I seriously doubt I may accept this idea, perhaps 
<br />
because I am not intelligent enough, rather old and quite convinced 
<br />
that the gradual integration of a total vision of the holistic 
<br />
landscape through many sensible and humanitarian perspectives may 
<br />
lead humans to create another world. After all I might assume that 
<br />
after dying I could try to motivate the &quot;One WHOLE&quot; to follow another 
<br />
way, not for the sake of changing but for increasing the number of 
<br />
humans willing to play a responsible role ON EARTH because we ARE 
<br />
FALL IN LOVE WITH LIFE. Attention it is the REAL LIFE neither a 
<br />
virtual nor an ethereal one.
