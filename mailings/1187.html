Dear Pavel, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I agree that information can only have a &quot;value&quot; or a &quot;meaning&quot; with
<br />
reference to a structure. Using the model of autopoiesis the information
<br />
is produced within one or more communication systems. These systems
<br />
contain structure (redundancy) since otherwise they would be &quot;dead&quot;. One
<br />
expect the &quot;value&quot; to be shaped in the longer run with reference to the
<br />
eigenvectors of the network. (Thus, values can be different in different
<br />
systems.) The eigenvectors can function as the axes of codification
<br />
insofar as they are stabilized over time.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Meaning&quot; adds a reflexive element to the dynamic. While &quot;value&quot; can
<br />
historically be stabilized, &quot;meaning&quot; globalizes from a hindsight
<br />
perspective because we are also able to abandon previous values. The
<br />
communication of meaning adds another layer to the system (as you note).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
I am less clear about what you mean with a concrete wall. I assume that
<br />
this is a metaphor. In fully developed evolutionary systems it tends to
<br />
be always &quot;five for twelve&quot;. This can also be considered as
<br />
self-organized criticality (on the edge of chaos).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Loet

Subject: RE: [Fis] Sustainable use of resources
<br />
<p><p><p>Dear Pedro and others, 
<br />
<p>a discussion on value, and on its connection with human evolution, is
<br />
indeed important for resolution of &quot;sustainability&quot; issue. Let me
<br />
provide a small speculation.
<br />
<p>In the paper which I have mentioned
<br />
(<a href="../../www.geocities.com/pluksha/papers/New_appr_info.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/pluksha/papers/New_appr_info.pdf</a>), I argue
<br />
that information has a dimension of axiology, or its value, which is
<br />
interconnected with &quot;optimality&quot; of its activities. What could be a
<br />
criterion for this optimality? - I could think of two: (1) evolutionary
<br />
criterion, that is, information assuring better &quot;survival&quot; (or,
<br />
self-maintenance of a system [and its copies, in case of
<br />
self-reproducing systems] for longer time) is more valuable; (2)
<br />
thermodynamic criterion, that is, information that assures achievement
<br />
of the same goal with fewer resources is more valuable.
<br />
<p>This concerns the value of information (the other side of which, as it
<br />
is argued, is regulation, or program - that is, a transformating
<br />
activity). Evolution of information systems presses for selection of
<br />
those with a more valuable information.
<br />
<p>For complex information systems, such as multicellular organisms and
<br />
social agents (individuals, and institutes), mechanisms of stimulation
<br />
of more valuable (and avoidance of less valuable) behaviour were
<br />
developed: such is a mechanism of pleasure / pain in organic life, and a
<br />
mechanism of social support / reproach in  social life. Over very long
<br />
periods of time, these mechanisms have proven their viability, although
<br />
sometimes they can break: e.g. chemical compounds such as alchogol and
<br />
drugs break the chemical basis of mechanism of pleasure; similarly, I
<br />
would interprete use of advertisment by contemporary capitalism as a
<br />
&quot;break&quot; in mechanism of social support (people tend to choose something
<br />
because everyone else like it; but nobody likes it yet, it is only
<br />
advertisment that tells us everyone like it).
<br />
<p>Following this logic, no objects in the &quot;outside world&quot;, in the
<br />
environment of a society [both &quot;external&quot;/natural, and
<br />
&quot;internal&quot;/artificial], have value by themselves. They can only have
<br />
value in respect to a given information system (e.g. a social
<br />
individual), a &quot;mode of use&quot; for this object by this system, and a value
<br />
of this &quot;mode of use&quot; (or this type of activity, or this information).
<br />
For example, for purpose of hammering, a microscope would have less
<br />
value than a hammer itself; for purpose of drinking, water has more
<br />
value than oil; and hammer is less valuable than water for someone dying
<br />
of thirst. This resembles a concept of &quot;consumer value&quot; which has been
<br />
discussed by classical economists, though somewhat &quot;natural consumer
<br />
value&quot; (which, as I remarked, is determined by value of the activity
<br />
itself). 
<br />
<p>I do not want to elaborate on how this &quot;natural value&quot; is transformed
<br />
into price of an object (economists have this discussion for some 300
<br />
years), but it is evident that oil, and other minerals, do have value in
<br />
a society. Society that started to use them (Western technology based
<br />
civilization) has proven to be more efficient than its opponents (e.g.
<br />
agrarian civilizations of the East and those of Africa). More valuable
<br />
information, and more valuable behavior has been selected in the course
<br />
of social evolution. Machines built of metal and plastics, and running
<br />
on gasoline, reduce human efforts to achieve same results
<br />
[&quot;thermodynamic criterion&quot;] and help a better survival [level of
<br />
mortality achieved in contemporary Western civilization is unmatched =
<br />
&quot;evolutionary criterion&quot;]. Western civilization is admired, in
<br />
particular by itself, for these achievements.
<br />
<p><p>So why is discussion there? What is a problem? The problem is that we
<br />
humans have prognostic capabiilities, that allow us to forecast
<br />
consequences of our actions. This trait helped the humanity to become
<br />
what it is: otherwise, no technology and no science would have been
<br />
possible (technology &quot;expects&quot; a result, and science tries to predict a
<br />
result). And our  prognostic capabilities tell us that this very
<br />
efficient organization of Western social life is a blindway running into
<br />
a big concrete wall. Heroine brings pleasure, indeed; but it also brings
<br />
swift death, so smart people avoid it. Our built-in evolutionary
<br />
mechanisms of pleasure do not help us to avoid it, but our conciousness
<br />
and our willpower do help. Similarly, our society is on the &quot;oil drug&quot;
<br />
or &quot;mineral drug&quot;. No evolutionary developed mechanisms of mass decision
<br />
taking, such as markets, or moral institutions, can help us to avoid it.
<br />
We like it (fast cars, computers, jets, ships, robots, large buildings
<br />
etc.), but our social mind has started to realize that death is coming. 
<br />
<p>So the major question, in my opinion, is NOT that oil is not valued
<br />
socially; it is. But the market mechanism is broken, it helps us to stay
<br />
on drug, it does not predict anything about possible upcoming shortage.
<br />
So, our society needs both reason and strong will to &quot;jump off the
<br />
needle&quot;: a sophisticated program is needed to change economic structure
<br />
that will have minimal dependency on deficit mineral resources. I wrote
<br />
about such possible program in my previous posting: (1) socio-economic
<br />
agents share responsibility for restoration of resources (increasing
<br />
their responsibility about misuse of resources); (2) governments start
<br />
economic resturcturing that in 20-25 years will help  industries to
<br />
shift towards bio-based technologies (from non-renewable towards
<br />
renewable resources). 
<br />
<p>Maybe this is a little chaotic, but I hope it is comprehendable. 
<br />
<p>Best regards, 
<br />
<p>Pavel

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Sergio and colleagues, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many thanks for your insightful comments. Let me improvise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some further 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points. Actually I was willing to spend some days reading the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers cited 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the last week, particularly Luis' bibliographic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compilation, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here there are some brief ideas: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- The final direction of Gordon Scarrott's views on value 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (exemplified 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by  the germane 'notary rule' of Valero) was that economic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems contain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an inborn trend toward a natural state. Roughly, it would the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hyperbolic or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Pareto distribution'. It can be approached by purely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical terms in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ways, but my favorite one is the partitional scheme 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; followed by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Karl Javorszky (see a couple of his messages a few days 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ago)... To put it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very briefly: my opinion is that the discussion on value (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utility) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be connected with central themes of biological theory, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finally revolves upon human Fitness and adaptability. This could lead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; towards a 'naturalization' of the economy in several senses... or its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'informationalization' perhaps. (But more will follow next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; week trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connect more rigorously with your very cogent explanations on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value--by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, in what extent are your views 'mainstream' respect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current economic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schools?). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- In the eMergy analysis you mention, as applied to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ecosystems, I see a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradox. How would do you evaluate a high level predator, just by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considering the multiplicative relation with the biomass at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lower level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the trophic interaction? A wolf for instance would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eMergetically 100 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times more valuable than, say, an oak? I tend to disagree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; captures the relevant organizational relations of ecosystem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; networks in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that eMergetic way (it would be OK about 'simple' resources). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ecologically, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some parties have advocated here 'ascendancy' theory by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ulanowicz (see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jerry, and also I think Loet and Pavel). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- For the viability of the economic reform you suggest at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the end, such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monumental a cultural change should occur in advance! I really cannot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine it. See for instance the existing 'international 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order'... In other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words, the dense interrelation of contemporary problems has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution in a very, very difficult situation. I do not like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Cassandra 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role, but civilized options are not in sight yet.
