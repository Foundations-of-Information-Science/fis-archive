Yes, I agree with much but not all,  of what John Holgate says. I am
<br />
aware that Pedro finds my criticisms of subjective opinions
<br />
'uninteresting', but we cannot, as rational beings, operate in a world
<br />
of personal opinions. That would be living in Plato's Cave.  What we
<br />
conclude, must be based on evidence -both actual and logical.
<br />
<p><p>[John Holgate]
<br />
If opinions are low-grade beliefs and knowledge is justified true
<br />
belief then opinions and knowledge are not binary opposites but part
<br />
of a continuum of belief ranging from 'subjective'
<br />
fanatacism and evangelism to 'objective' scientific truth. The
<br />
opinions of Giordano Bruno were considered illogical and evangelical
<br />
in their time. Later they became acceptable beliefs
<br />
and components of a body of knowledge. Given other circumstances even
<br />
Charles Peirce
<br />
(or Germaine Greer) might have been burnt at the stake for heresy.
<br />
<p>[Edwina]
<br />
No - here I would disagree. You are defining knowledge and truth as
<br />
resting only in the 'most common' opinion. You are retaining its
<br />
definition as a 'belief' and defining their validity only when they
<br />
become believed by the majority. This is merely moving, in Plato's
<br />
Cave or Bacon's world, from the belief held by the individual to the
<br />
belief held by the group. From 'doxa' to 'pistis' for Plato' - and -
<br />
Bacon's 'Theatre'. And - the fallacy of 'the popular opinion'.
<br />
Whether held by one individual or a group, it's still an opinion and
<br />
unless grounded in real hard empirical proof as well as logic - it's a
<br />
fallacy.
<br />
<p>[John Holgate]The truth of a belief is not in its logicality but in
<br />
its justification.
<br />
<p>That pregnant unwed mothers should be decapitated is quite a logical
<br />
belief for the Nigerian government but it is not an (ethically)
<br />
justified belief.
<br />
[Edwina] Again, a belief can't be defined as truthful only if
<br />
justified. That is setting up a Truth Formula where your premisses can
<br />
be completely invalid but, as long as you have premisses, then, you
<br />
define your beliefs as 'valid'. ie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unwed mothers are evil.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is an unwed mother
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this woman is evil.
<br />
The premisses are opinions and require proof. The society has to
<br />
define the nature of evil and the actual proof that an unwed  mother
<br />
actualizes that. I think that all the society could do to justify
<br />
itself would be pure tautologies. It cannot prove, empirically, that
<br />
there is any relationship.
<br />
<p><p>[John Holgate]What role does 'information' play in all this? Is it, if
<br />
it exists at all, a kind of ubiquitous
<br />
crap-detector or a cognitive mist we have to pass through to get to
<br />
the truth?
<br />
<p>Luciano Floridi's paper addresses the question from a hardcore logic
<br />
perspective
<br />
with his 'alethic' approach but the jury is still out.
<br />
<p>In my view misinformation is a distortion of true belief rather than
<br />
an absence of information altogether.
<br />
<p>Your opinion?
<br />
<p>[Edwina] I consider misinformation both a distortion and an absence.
<br />
If someone tells me that 'women are nurturing' and 'men are violent',
<br />
then I consider this merely an opinion, unfounded as well as
<br />
misinformed. Therefore, it is an absence of information, for if the
<br />
speaker went to empirical tests, they would find that the statement is
<br />
simply, empirically, false. Their conclusion is ignoring information,
<br />
and takes the next step of simply 'making up' the conclusion...without
<br />
any evidential premisses.

Subject: opinions vs knowledge
<br />
<p><p>Again, I ask why are evangelistic opinions posted to this discussion
<br />
site? The reply to my rejection of the evangelistic post about women
<br />
having innate 'love' capacities while men do not and therefore, they
<br />
can 'save the world' was yet another post filled with illogical
<br />
opinions, this time from Thommandel (don't know his/her real name).
<br />
<p>I don't think that readers want a sentence by sentence deconstruction
<br />
of that reply, but I could show how each sentence is based on nothing
<br />
more than subjective opinion. Each collection of sentences, when
<br />
framed in any kind of logical form,  leads to an invalid 'conclusion'.
<br />
The reply has nothing to do with knowledge or information. These are
<br />
nothing more than subjective non-empirical and illogical opinions,
<br />
filled with pure speculation, with moving from 'some' to 'all', with
<br />
lots of 'perhaps' suggestions suddenly moving to 'always'; with false
<br />
innuendoes,  with insertion of emotive fallacies - ad hominem, ad
<br />
populam,...and....false data, false links, sentences following each
<br />
other without any valid logical or empirical relation.
<br />
<p>Again - what does this type of post have to do with the scientific,
<br />
rational examination of information? I could use these posts for
<br />
students to take apart in my critical thinking and logic classes -
<br />
but - what are they doing on this list?
