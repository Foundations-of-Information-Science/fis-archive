<p>
Dear Pedro and James,
<br />
<p>I support, that there was an unprecedented qualitative &quot;mutation&quot; (jump, 
<br />
cesura) in the evolution, when life came into existence. (Although I could 
<br />
not indentify, in molecular sense, in which stage this new quality was 
<br />
produced.) At the same time, other, minor qualitative changes occured even 
<br />
earlier and later, too.
<br />
<p>To attribute information to physical systems was always quite natural for 
<br />
me, as physicist. I had not supposed, that others restricted information 
<br />
only to living systems. (Of course, this is diffenernt type information, 
<br />
but it is information.)
<br />
<p>I agree, that we should classify information [then find again what is 
<br />
common in them]. Within that, let's allow the class of structural 
<br />
information, some (not so much definite) class of intrinsic information, 
<br />
and - in this sense - we can set up further classes.
<br />
<p>I cannot agree  &quot;...in the objective, intrinsic, observer-independent sense 
<br />
..&quot;: Observer-dependent sense is not objective. Just this is, what we call 
<br />
subjective.
<br />
<p>I disagree, that &quot;there simply was no information at all before the origin 
<br />
of life, because there were no  systems yet able to enter into the right 
<br />
sort of dynamical interactions that are in fact constitutive of 
<br />
information-use&quot;
<br />
<p>1. Dynamical interactions characterise physical processes as well. (This is 
<br />
what I mentioned a few days ago in this discussion, that involving the 
<br />
different usages of the term &quot;dynamical&quot; can diversificate our discussion.)
<br />
<p>2. Concerning information before life:
<br />
<p>Interpretations of classical quantum mechanics (QM) were shaped along the 
<br />
interpretation of the role of measurement. Measuring means to gain 
<br />
information from an object or a system of objects. Physicists in each lab 
<br />
are engaged with collecting information. (So do chemists as well.)
<br />
<p>This information may be structural (e.g., we observe that this atom 
<br />
consists of a two protons + two neutrons nuclei and two electrons, then we 
<br />
can conclude, this is He).
<br />
This information may be dynamical, (when we observe that a particle moves 
<br />
with a given speed, has a given mass, momentum, etc., it produces a 
<br />
spectrum, what provides us information about its magnetic moment, spin, 
<br />
charge, other quantum numbers, etc), i.e., information abut its geometrical 
<br />
and intrinsic (dynamic) properties.
<br />
<p>The description of the classical QM is based on the state functions (wawe 
<br />
functions) assigned to the individual physical units. A state function can 
<br />
be represented by a column, where we list, under each other, the values of 
<br />
the different properties, what can characterise that unit. Each of these 
<br />
properties can actualise one from a set  of values. This set of possible 
<br />
values can be calculated by the Schrödinger equation (eigenvalues). Each 
<br />
measurement provides us with a spectrum of the probabilities, how often the 
<br />
measured proeperty takes the individual values of that set. This is our 
<br />
(dynamic) information on that physical unit. (There are many information 
<br />
condensed in that unit, and we can gain only a part of that information 
<br />
[capacity] during a given measurement.)
<br />
<p>Structural and intrinsic properties together determine the possible ways of 
<br />
interaction, the given object may interact with its environment (with other 
<br />
objects in its environment). When we forecast, that during the planned 
<br />
experiment the lab will explode, or the planned sequence of events will 
<br />
occur, we evaluate the information, what we had collected on the 
<br />
participating agents. The (possible) interactions of a given physical unit 
<br />
with its environment are determined by the information (capacity - using 
<br />
the term after John Collier) condensed in it. (Even a physical object 
<br />
&quot;evaluates&quot; and &quot;selects&quot; the information it receives from the other before 
<br />
it interacts with an other object. It will never ineract violating laws of 
<br />
nature.) The amount of this information (capacity) increases during the 
<br />
evolution, thus more complex systems are able for more sophisticated 
<br />
interactions. There are qualitative demarcation lines in this evolution 
<br />
process. No doubt, the greatest cesura were when the life, then when the 
<br />
human thought came into existence.
<br />
<p>Interpretations of the classical QM  realised early the difference between 
<br />
the structural and the dynamic informations gained from the physical 
<br />
objects and processes. Therefore they replaced the role of the &quot;object&quot; by 
<br />
the role of the &quot;event&quot;. An event is, where the dynamic interaction takes 
<br />
place, since we can  get information only from interacting objects. (The 
<br />
process of information gaining, i.e., the measurement itself, is also a 
<br />
kind of interaction - now with the instrument.)
<br />
<p>I hope I was clear enough in defending inorganic information. I hope I 
<br />
could help to reconcile the &quot;two viewpoints&quot;.
<br />
<p>Best, Gyuri
