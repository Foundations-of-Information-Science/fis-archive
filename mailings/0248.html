Dear Pedro
<br />
<p>I do think your basic view  (below) makes sense. I suggest that we look at the world as not only complex and turbulent, but as hypercomplex. This indicates that one does not believe that science will ever be able to find &quot;the cause&quot; or &quot;the explanation&quot; o
<br />
f the stucture and development of the world or of a specific organism or human act.
<br />
<p>I furhter agree in that the world is &quot;informational&quot; or I would prefer semiotic to avoid the idea of information without meaning and qualia. This aspect is mostly driven by and enhanced by the living systems.
<br />
<p>These two aspects limits the usefulness of a traditional mechanistic causality concept very considerably.

Dear fis colleagues,
<br />
<p>Some comments of past days could be related to the topic of &quot;causality&quot;
<br />
--how causality is distributed among the different entities that compose
<br />
the world, and how science manages to capture it and to build &quot;causal
<br />
explanations&quot;. Quite a few philosophical debates surround these topics, so
<br />
what follows has to be taken --am affraid-- with something else than a
<br />
grain of salt:
<br />
<p>1. Assuming a pluralistic stance (&quot;promiscuous realism&quot; for philosopher J.
<br />
Dupré) causality does not stem only from the microphysical or the chemical
<br />
real. All objects -entities- both large and small have reality and causal
<br />
efficacy. Thus causality becomes a too scattered and variable feature to be
<br />
tracked down in a logical way along the compositional layers of existence.
<br />
Existential turbulence (the chaotic mixing of scales and dynamics) impinges
<br />
massively and makes up for the famous &quot;butterfly effect&quot; and in general for
<br />
the interplay of mutual order/disorder islands in inanimate nature.
<br />
<p>2. Beyond turbulence and its apparently pernicious effects on causality
<br />
(actually it is the oposite: it enriches the world with a fascinating
<br />
variability) a new source of problems stem from the phenomenon of life. In
<br />
my opinion, with life there is the emergence of both &quot;information&quot; and
<br />
&quot;agency&quot;... the living agent is immersed in a cycle of
<br />
self-production-degradation activities, it has to perform regularly
<br />
&quot;abduction&quot; operations upon its environment (and doing so it extracts
<br />
&quot;info&quot;), it enacts new laws that intersect with natural laws, it can relate
<br />
to other agents and create higher level ones, etc.
<br />
<p>3. As a result, the &quot;informational turbulence&quot; of life enters into the
<br />
causality game, and generates the amazing tapestry of organizational and
<br />
social phenomena that so efficiently master the inanimate nature. This high
<br />
level causality has its own rules, in general abductive (informational)
<br />
ones. Abduction is a central operation: myriads of futile items are
<br />
discarded and only a few relevant ones count as information. If it is so,
<br />
any conception of a seamless web of causality is alien to the real
<br />
individual and social practice of organisms in their handling of info
<br />
phenomena.
<br />
<p>4. Science becomes the rather limited enterprise of building causal
<br />
explanations --whenever and wherever possible. Then the problem with
<br />
reductionism and the like (defenders of the unity of science) is that they
<br />
conceal the most interesting aspect of the system of the sciences: how the
<br />
scarce islands of order that we can capture in the world have to be used in
<br />
any imaginable combination and mixing in order to tackle the turbulence of
<br />
real world problems. Unfortunately, in the name of a myth (an ideology?) we
<br />
have been left without any notice or any interesting discussion about the
<br />
genuine Art of interplaying perspectives that is at the very center of the
<br />
scientific activities...
<br />
<p>If the above has any consistency --what I doubt- one of the missions of
<br />
info science would precisely be throwing a new light upon that fascinating
<br />
info game that we scientists individually and collectively perform.
<br />
<p>bests
