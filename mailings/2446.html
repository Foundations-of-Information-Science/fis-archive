<p>
Dear Andrei and List,
<br />
<p>I have been reading the session opening post for a few days now and 
<br />
trying to make sense of it in terms of the Foundations of Information 
<br />
Science.
<br />
<p>These questions continue to be raised and I am glad the session here 
<br />
causes me to return to them.  They continue to be the center of an 
<br />
ongoing crisis in physics.  I am not sure of the state of play - and it 
<br />
would be useful to me to have a physicist summarize the latest work.  
<br />
<p>The last paper I reviewed on the subject was James Malley's paper 
<br />
(<a href="../../arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/0402/0402126.pdf">http://arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/0402/0402126.pdf</a>)  which, at the 
<br />
time, I thought convincingly showed that EPR results do not commute.  A 
<br />
paper from Daniele Tommasini 
<br />
(<a href="../../philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000651/00/locaqft.pdf">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000651/00/locaqft.pdf</a>) 
<br />
appears to show that EPR is unmeasurable.  I'd like to hear the standing 
<br />
of these papers today, if anyone knows.
<br />
<p>I was fortunate to be in a conversation with Roger Penrose a few years 
<br />
ago about these questions and he put it rather well by saying that he 
<br />
was troubled that cricket balls did not appear to behave according to 
<br />
the rules of quantum physics. 
<br />
<p>I have a number of standing questions about entanglement theory 
<br />
especially as it related of molecular biology. For example:  Is an 
<br />
entire organism considered to be an entangled entity?  What is the 
<br />
theoretical and experimental justification for stem cells as origin of 
<br />
entangled cell structures?  How does that work according to entanglement 
<br />
physics?  It is simple to consider entanglement in the case of single 
<br />
photons, it is rather more difficult to generalize it.  Although, 
<br />
aggregate manifestations of entanglement may, in fact, be easier to deal 
<br />
with both experimentally and theoretically.
<br />
<p>What Penrose is getting at by the above remark is that if such states as 
<br />
entanglement/non-locality and superposition do exist at the quantum 
<br />
level they must surely manifest at the classical level.  Andrei's appeal 
<br />
to scale in his recent post seems unreasonable (he essentially asks at 
<br />
what increase of mass entanglement stops). 
<br />
<p>Hence, entangled states/non-locality, superposition, must necessarily be 
<br />
in the mechanics of information theory.  In other words, we need a 
<br />
theory of information that unifies classical and quantum theories - or 
<br />
we need some reasonable explanation of why there should be two theories.
<br />
<p>I think there may, in fact, be ready manifestation of 
<br />
entanglement/non-locality at the classical level underlying the 
<br />
integration of experience in senses. If this is not a classical level 
<br />
manifestation of entanglement and non-locality then it requires that we 
<br />
do something like Jonathan Edwards' 
<br />
(<a href="../../www.ucl.ac.uk/~regfjxe/aw.htm">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~regfjxe/aw.htm</a>) proposal and reduce integrated 
<br />
experience to single cells.  This does not seem likely in my view 
<br />
because the argument reduces to a point and if it does not the locality 
<br />
issues remain within the cell.  However, I do think Jonathan's work is 
<br />
very interesting and worthy.  In my view, even if the manifestation is 
<br />
isolated to a single cell or just a few cells in the brain, the locality 
<br />
issue is a problem for sentience engineering and cognitive science. 
<br />
(Obvious example: smash fingers from both hands in a door. How is it you 
<br />
can integrate the pain of each together in a single cognition?) 
<br />
<p>Indeed, I do currently assume in my work that there is this 
<br />
manifestation of entanglement/non-locality at the classical level of 
<br />
sentience engineering and that it does explain the integration of 
<br />
experience.  However, whether this non-locality and associated sensory / 
<br />
cognitive integration relates directly to EPR I leave as an open 
<br />
question.  There are many miles to go before we sleep.  It certainly 
<br />
would be convenient, however, if I could say with some certainty that 
<br />
all organisms are entangled entities - in a single whole or in parts.
<br />
<p>As to the Toshiba device, as they say here in the USA, &quot;I'm from 
<br />
Missouri&quot; (the &quot;show me&quot; state) - I will wait until they actually have 
<br />
something to show before passing judgment.
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven
<br />
