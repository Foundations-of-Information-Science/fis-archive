Koichiro's multiply pregnant posting stimultes me to take up my own
<br />
outrageous point again, just to make sure that I have made it clear (so all
<br />
and sundry can decompose into laughter!).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multiple worlds I was postulating derived from&quot; observation&quot; being
<br />
frequently made by every complicated enough dynamical system within the
<br />
universe (equating 'observation' with a kind of interactive dynamics that
<br />
might cause decoherence).  This means that where I find myself at any
<br />
moment comes complete with a coherent memory (known to be multiply &quot;false&quot;
<br />
in any case!).  The important point comes with one's own attitude --
<br />
emotionally postive or negative.  If positive, my actions will create, in
<br />
almost every moment, a world + memory favorable to my being, if negative,
<br />
etc.  Thus, consider the case when my car on a crowded road slipped on
<br />
spilled oil, took flight in the direction of oncoming traffic, but at the
<br />
last moment something in its rear hit the low dividing fence between the
<br />
roadbeds and my car twisted back in the direction of its own roadbed again,
<br />
landing fairly softly and moving in its original direction, if wiggling a
<br />
bit.  One -- a rather unlikely one -- of the multiple possible worlds
<br />
branching off at that instant came to be, I can only say because my
<br />
'spiritual orientation' at the moment was positive.  BUT, for others at the
<br />
scene this is NOT what happened at all.  The next day in most of the
<br />
branched off worlds there was a news item about a calamitous crash in which
<br />
the unfortunate driver was killed, as were others [I can still see the
<br />
faces in the oncoming cars looking up at me as I was suspended before them
<br />
just prior to the (in my world) rectifying bump in the rear saved us all.].
<br />
So, in many -- even most -- other worlds I have been gone these many years,
<br />
but here I am in my own.  So, will this go on forever?  Not so, I think.
<br />
One gets tired of the everyday debilitating insults from the weather, from
<br />
disease, from pests, from all things one is NOT CONSCIOUS OF that are
<br />
continually generating annoyances, from colds to floods, that fill our
<br />
days.  I have yet to experience a disaster tht I anticipated.  But you
<br />
cannot anticipate everything, and the bad event always comes upon one from
<br />
&quot;nowhere&quot;.  Eventually one says, with Count Dracula, &quot;Oh, to hell with it
<br />
all!&quot;, and with this attitude, the killing event will soon befall.  This is
<br />
not unrelated I suppose to the fact that a positive attitude can suppress
<br />
the growth of cancer, for example.  Unfortunately this view does bear the
<br />
burden of accusing those that fail, and those that die, of not bracing up
<br />
well enough.  Their demise was their own fault!  This seems at least to
<br />
lack compassion.  But I have not infrequently found that what seemed to me
<br />
to be a &quot;truth&quot; was extremely unpalatable (like my conviction that we all
<br />
first and foremost serve the Second Law of thermodynamics).   Well, I have
<br />
used up my weekly ration of postings.
<br />
<p>In a minor key,
<br />
STAN
<br />
<p><p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Malcom and Stan,       Malcom's preference to one-world view seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quite  continental in the spirit of Rafael instead of merely being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analytical, and  not quite antagonistic to Stan's preference to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many-worlds. Here is my  excuse.      If we are happy with applying the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;successful standard  practice of quantum mechanics to the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe at large, we may  also have to assume somebody who would sit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outside of the universe and see  what is going on in the inside. According
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the accepted user's manual, the  universe may transit from the possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the actual every time the observer  does the job through the collapse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the wavefunction. However, there have been  some dissidents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;including Everett, DeWitt and Gell-Mann among others as  charging the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outrageous.       DeWitt's many-world interpretation must be one necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consequence out of dismissing the idea of the observer sitting outside of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe as unfounded. One remedy for the purpose would be to live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with another outrageous picture that our actual universe is just one  of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the many alternatives when the inhabitants look into the past, while it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constantly serves as the source of branching off into many  alternatives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;toward the future. One sturdy problem with the many-world  scenario is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether the universe we experience as the incumbents has  anything special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compared with all of the others already branched off. This  question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;touches upon what is the durable fundamental set of the elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructing the actual universe, that is , the choice of the preferred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;basis  set in the physicist jargon. No easy solution in sight, so far.   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   At this point, Jerry's concern on chemical syntax may  enter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Firstly, quantum  mechanics grounds itself upon the present progressive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tense being concurrent and  punctuated with the present perfect tense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This stipulation is entirely  empirical. Secondly, chemistry as a material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substrate of biology is  also empirical in bridging the present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;progressive and the present  perfect tense. Chemical reaction is about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process of updating the reactants  once registered in the present perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tense again through their resurrection in  the movement in progressive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Chemistry practices quantum mechanics so that the  material record
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;registered in the present perfect tense may constantly be  updated. One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outcome would be to return products in the  downstream again back into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reactants in the upstream, as letting the whole  reaction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scheme circular.$B!!(BOnce the robust closure of chemical  reactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is formed, it could be settled also in the biological  organization.     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   If the branching of one world off into many happens to  generate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange world almost similar to the one branched off previously,  that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange one could be retained and entrapped in a closure. This would  make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our physical universe quite biological. Still, another outrageous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;picture?      Cheers,    Koichiro
