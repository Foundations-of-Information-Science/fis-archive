                <p>
                    Dear Pedro,
                    <br />
                <p>If living organisms are molecular machines according to principles we
                    <br />
                    currently understand then there is no explanation of experience
                    <br />
                    according to current &quot;science of the artificial.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>As Goranson says, &quot;Most scientists assume that the basics of science
                    <br />
                    are known.&quot; The sciences of the artificial essentially adhere to the
                    <br />
                    view that our physical models are complete and that, where there lies
                    <br />
                    difficulty, explanations with the same essential properties as existent
                    <br />
                    theories will be available.
                    <br />
                <p>Roger Penrose has been pointing out the inadequacy of this position for
                    <br />
                    a decade and a half. As recently as January, in the journal Nature, he
                    <br />
                    says &quot;... I perhaps have enough of the physicist's arrogance about me to
                    <br />
                    believe that a physical 'theory of everything' should at least contain
                    <br />
                    the seeds of an explanation of the phenomenon of consciousness. It seems
                    <br />
                    to me that this phenomenon is such a fundamental one that it cannot be
                    <br />
                    simply an accidental concomitant of the complexity of brain action. ...&quot;
                    <br />
                    (full text: <a
                        href="../../www.quantumconsciousness.org/TOE.htm">http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/TOE.htm</a>).
                    I agree.
                    <br />
                <p>I have only recently entered the fray. In my discussions across
                    <br />
                    disciplines I encounter three positions that violate the clear
                    <br />
                    principles of good science.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Experience is not a phenomenon of the world and therefore
                    <br />
                    requires no explanation.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Experience is an emergent phenomenon of the world that require
                    <br />
                    no further explanation.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Experience is a phenomenon of the world that simply cannot be
                    <br />
                    explained.
                    <br />
                <p>None of these positions can be formalized since none can be quantified,
                    <br />
                    none can be verified and certainly none can be falsified. It is not
                    <br />
                    simply that the explanation is missing from physics and needs to be
                    <br />
                    included in physical theories - the explanation must also find its way
                    <br />
                    into the Foundations of Information Science and the Foundations of
                    <br />
                    Mathematics.
                    <br />
                <p>Logic has wrestled with the problem for a long time and failed (e.g.,
                    <br />
                    Peirce, Carnap et al.), but perhaps it is in the Foundations of Logic
                    <br />
                    that new ground can be broken.
                    <br />
                <p>The reason that these positions remain and are widely accepted comes
                    <br />
                    from a deeply rooted conservatism and a misguided belief that we are at
                    <br />
                    the pinnacle of our scientific achievement - it seems to me that any
                    <br />
                    such belief is, inevitably, the pinnacle of our ignorance.
                    <br />
                <p>The motivations for these violations in the USA are especially
                    <br />
                    unfortunate and I have discovered over the past two years that one of
                    <br />
                    the unspoken reasons they persist here is that many scientists and
                    <br />
                    mathematicians seek to &quot;leave room for God.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>In raising research funding I have to be careful not to offend
                    <br />
                    individuals with sincere beliefs in the traditional mysteries - and I
                    <br />
                    sincerely mean no offense - but there really can be no room in science
                    <br />
                    for such an allowance. We must follow science wherever it may lead and
                    <br />
                    allow it to inform faith, defining any notion we may have of God
                    <br />
                    accordingly.
                    <br />
                <p>For these reasons, progress may be impossible in the USA - even in my
                    <br />
                    beloved California.
                    <br />
                <p>With respect,
                    <br />
                    Steven
                    <br />

&gt; Dear colleagues,
&gt;
&gt; Trying to sum up the themes of my yesterday message (in this my second 
&gt; post of the week), the emphasis might be put in the insufficient 
&gt; theoretical distinction, real conflation, between:
&gt;
&gt; INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
&gt;
&gt; PROCESSUAL LIFE CYCLES
&gt;
&gt; As a matter of fact, the latter have been caught under the wings of 
&gt; the former as one of the core ideas of the &quot;sciences of the 
&gt; artificial&quot; (eg, in whole disciplines such as artificial intel., 
&gt; cognitive psych., artificial life, molecular computing...). Ideas and 
&gt; philosophies of information have been imported and circulated into the 
&gt; &quot;sciences of the natural&quot; without much trouble --aren't living 
&gt; organisms but &quot;molecular machines&quot;? Even more, most of the rhetorics 
&gt; under the banner of information society, knowledge engineering, 
&gt; entrepreneurial information, etc., is also built around deliberate 
&gt; confusion between the two realms --aren't we but info processing 
&gt; systems?, why couldn't computers be conscious?
&gt;
&gt; Clarifying the relationships along the above informational blurred 
&gt; boundary may be important ---perhaps by theorizing along the 
&gt; processual characteristics of life cycles we could advance response to 
&gt; some of the fundamental questions proposed by Ted about the fis agenda 
&gt; (his report at &lt;<a href="../../www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/goranson1">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/goranson1</a>&gt; 
&gt; deserves very careful reading).
&gt;
&gt; greetings,
