<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Goodness, what a trepidant discussion! We have at least half dozen open
<br />
tracks... I believe we have stumbled upon really crucial elements of info
<br />
sci. future identity. In what follows I try to interconnect some of those
<br />
views with my own themes.   
<br />
<p>About the info &amp; physics discussion, obviously I am closer to James and
<br />
Juan; but I do not feel there is any terrible divide involved. At least
<br />
from my side, the use of the term 'information' in the physical realm is
<br />
not bluntly rejected: eg, structural or 'state' info, as contemplated in
<br />
the different mechanics, or as Shu-Kun was discussing statiscal-molecularly
<br />
oriented. We cannot run against the most consolidated scientific traditions
<br />
in that regard. However, what I do in my own contribution (discussants are
<br />
kindly invited to take its contents into account too--actually this
<br />
pretends to be a discussion bassed on papers!), is to apply the term
<br />
'informational' only to those paradigmatic entities on which I propose
<br />
focussing theoretical discussion and future empirical research --cells,
<br />
brains, firms.
<br />
<p>Let me explain why metaphorically. While the time any of the fis
<br />
discussants is reading these comments, one minute say, billions of their
<br />
own enzymes and proteins are being degraded by their proteasomes &amp;
<br />
proteases; in the hundred thousands of their constitutive cells are
<br />
committing apoptosis;  billions of synapsis in their brains are becoming
<br />
'plastic' and weakening or strengthening their electro-molecular
<br />
conductivity (even sprouting or disappearing themselves); and who knows, if
<br />
the fiser owns a research company he or she my be cashing 10 bucks (or
<br />
losing them!); and if she or he owns stocks in a capital risk biotech
<br />
company, maybe 100 bucks are coming in-out each very minute...  
<br />
<p>To that club of strange existentialities, always in the making and in the
<br />
degrading, always receiving signals from their evironment and counting and
<br />
processing those signals and changing accordingly (ADAPTIVELY) their
<br />
structures... is to what I reserve 'informational'.
<br />
<p>It may look a retreat from more ambititious conceptualizations, but
<br />
focusing on the above type of paradoxical entities, emerging out from a
<br />
continuous 'evanescent permanence' (and let us include quite many other
<br />
human social and cultural 'products', eg, the sciences, the arts, or
<br />
library science), we might gain the conceptual generalizations to advance
<br />
the info science synthesis. As Robert Rosen put, biology ('info') finally
<br />
becomes larger than physics... For instance, exploring the impact of such
<br />
signaling dynamics upon the related structures, we find the 'power law'
<br />
theme, emerging as a peculiar signature of 'mature' info systems (see
<br />
Andrei's convergent physical views about that too). I also refer to a host
<br />
of interesting conceptualizations looming (eg, function, knowledge,
<br />
symmetry, etc.--see my paper).
<br />
<p>It is clear for me, that in the long term, there should be a convergence
<br />
with new physics' basic themes. But right now it is rather
<br />
counterproductive trying to directly forge such links: in a subtle way, it
<br />
conduces to another instance within the 'particulate' complex of thought
<br />
which characterizes most approaches to info (see my paper). For instance,
<br />
why 'econophysics' has recently been coined to describe most of the new
<br />
approaches, complexity inspired ones, to the dynamics of firms?  The
<br />
position of a firm in a market and its strategic moves -mergers,
<br />
splittings, monopoly- can be cogently described by the 'invisible hand'
<br />
emerging from the above informational exchanges in a special power lw
<br />
setting...  
<br />
<p>In sum (and let me be bold): why relapsing into mere neo-reductionisms
<br />
rather than revolutionarily exploring the conceptual, theoretical and
<br />
empirical avenues of the new info science so necessary for the other
<br />
sciences and for societies in the new 'info era'?
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. I could exhange discussions on some of the above stuff with Michael
<br />
Conrad. His only objection was that the sequence of fundamental info
<br />
entities was for him: cells, brains, niches. Economy, he put, was but our
<br />
'artificial ecosystem'... We finally agreed that human societies have
<br />
performed a dramatic bifurcation and invented a brand-new existential realm
<br />
(but not independent from nature's own info games: it is finally supported
<br />
by the info 'calculations' of the natural ecosystems too!)
