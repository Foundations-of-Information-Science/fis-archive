                <p>
                    Dear Colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>These are exciting times we live in. What we are witnessing may be
                    <br />
                    described as an emerging New Renaissance in science, technology and
                    <br />
                    philosophy, and all of it is related to computing/information*.
                    <br />
                <p>In order to support the above claim let me quote two of Ted's
                    <br />
                    statements; that in my view both amount to the need of new logic -
                    <br />
                    pluralist informational logic that is closely related to the new
                    <br />
                    paradigm of computation - interactional computation (which can be seen
                    <br />
                    as generalization of algorithmic computation).
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;I myself see a continuity between Einstein's revolution in situating
                    <br />
                    physical notions, Freud's in situating social ones (though his mechanics
                    <br />
                    are weak) and what we must do in the general domain whose &quot;situation&quot;
                    <br />
                    spans physics through societal concepts and fashions.&quot; (Ted)
                    <br />
                <p>Being originally a physicist, I focus on Einstein because the comparison
                    <br />
                    with Newton is instructive on several levels. For me it is in the first
                    <br />
                    place a question of giving up absolutes.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the perspective of Computing and Philosophy the shift from Newton's
                    </em><br />
                    universe to Einstein's seems to be a crucial one. Historically, as a
                    <br />
                    scientist, one was forced to leave absolutes, one by one. We were
                    <br />
                    shifted from the center of the Universe, only to later on be forced to
                    <br />
                    leave the idea of absolute space altogether and what is even worse to
                    <br />
                    give up the absolute time - all of it was really painful.
                    <br />
                <p>The next offer that will be necessary to make, will be to leave the
                    <br />
                    Absolute Truth and it is not without very good reasons people will be
                    <br />
                    ready to do that.
                    <br />
                <p>Focusing on information instead of knowledge can be the smoothest way to
                    <br />
                    go from logical monism which is the ruling paradigm of science and a
                    <br />
                    precondition for the absolute truth. The alternative, logical pluralism
                    <br />
                    leads necessarily to models where truth is not conserved as there is no
                    <br />
                    absolute logical space it can be attached to - no privileged agent
                    <br />
                    taking part in information exchange whose frame of reference including
                    <br />
                    logic would be the absolute one. Information is something that is
                    <br />
                    characteristic of dynamical system; knowledge presupposes steady states.
                    <br />
                    Knowledge is not something you receive today and discard tomorrow.
                    <br />
                    Information is.
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;I believe it inevitable that we revisit logic. Many have concluded this
                    <br />
                    as well. (I've mentioned Barwise before.) Alternative logics already
                    <br />
                    exist in fields that presently seem remote from science - in fact this
                    <br />
                    is the point, they seem remote from science precisely because their
                    <br />
                    logics are so different. I suggest we consider artistic and
                    <br />
                    humanity-centric &quot;logics&quot; also, as we hunt for tools, and be open to a
                    <br />
                    scope that includes internal conceptual mechanics: desires, intuitions,
                    <br />
                    emotions, creativity.&quot; - to quote Ted again.
                    <br />
                <p>I definitely agree with the need of new logic - specifically logical
                    <br />
                    pluralism. Actually pluralist's logics are developing within the theory
                    <br />
                    of computing and they will soon show as tools we need to
                    <br />
                    re-conceptualize the world (or at least computational theory of it) in
                    <br />
                    terms of this radically new interaction paradigm.
                    <br />
                <p>Today's computers are information-processing devices that have changed
                    <br />
                    dramatically compared to their original function that consisted in
                    <br />
                    sequential processing of data. Contrary to traditional algorithmic
                    <br />
                    computation, in which computer provided with a suitable algorithm and an
                    <br />
                    input was left alone to crunch the numbers until algorithm terminated,
                    <br />
                    interactive computation implies interaction i.e. communication of the
                    <br />
                    computing process with the external world during the computation.
                    <br />
                <p>Computational processes are now conceived as distributed, reactive,
                    <br />
                    agent-based and concurrent.
                    <br />
                <p>Interaction consequently provides a new conceptualization of
                    <br />
                    computational phenomena which involves communication and information
                    <br />
                    exchange.
                    <br />
                <p>The problems that are to be solved by natural computing/ soft computing
                    <br />
                    are of the following kind:
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;Physical systems described by multiple variable and multiple parameter
                    <br />
                    models having non-linear coupling, frequently occur in the fields of
                    <br />
                    physics, engineering, technical applications, economy, etc. The
                    <br />
                    conventional approaches for understanding and predicting the behaviour
                    <br />
                    of such systems based on analytical techniques can prove to be very
                    <br />
                    difficult, even at the initial stages of establishing an appropriate
                    <br />
                    mathematical model. The computational environment used in such an
                    <br />
                    analytical approach is perhaps too categoric and inflexible in order to
                    <br />
                    cope with the intricacy and the complexity of the real world physical
                    <br />
                    systems.&quot; <a
