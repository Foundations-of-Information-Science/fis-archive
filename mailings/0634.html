<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Let me express first that I thank Prof. Matjaz  Mulej and Prof. Miroslav
<br />
Rebernik the invitation to participate in  a Round Table on Bertalanffian
<br />
Thinking (STIQE 2002).
<br />
<p>Secondly, just in case some of you have not been informed properly, let me
<br />
mention that last November 1 - 4, 2001, culminated the celebration of the
<br />
100th Anniversary of Ludwig von Bertalanffy's Birthday.  This event was
<br />
only a modest contribution towards the proper recognition of the work
<br />
carried out by the Father of the General Systems Theory , which I could
<br />
discover only recently when I had the opportunity to read &quot;Uncommon Sense.
<br />
The life and thought of Luwig von Bertalanffy&quot; though Mark Davidson wrote
<br />
this biography since 1983.
<br />
<p>After all it is important to notice that Mark accepted the challenge to
<br />
write his biography when he:
<br />
<p>&quot;(... discovered) that Bertalanffy has espoused a single standard of
<br />
morality which is a viewpoint I find irresistibly appealing because it is
<br />
extremely rare and (to my mind) absolutely necessary if humanity is to
<br />
survive.&quot;...&quot;As a single-standard-bearer in general, he was a scientist who
<br />
repudiated the arrogance of scientism, a biologist who rejected the
<br />
heredity-is-everything dogma of biologism, a laboratory researcher who
<br />
questioned the absolute value of empiricism, an agnostic who denounce
<br />
materialism, and a systems science pionner who warned that systems science
<br />
could be used for totalitarism&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p>BAC 2001 took place with the presentation of several papers that were
<br />
dealing with systems needed for coping with problems seen through
<br />
biological, social, philosophical, technological, methodological and
<br />
mathematical interpretations. The participants could start only to
<br />
recognize the humanitarian concern that motivated Bertalanffy to declare:
<br />
<p>the overall fate of the world depends on the adoption by humanity of a new
<br />
set of values, based on a general systems Weltanschauung (worldview). &quot;We
<br />
are seeking another basic outlook: the world as organization. This
<br />
[outlook] would profoundly change the categories of our thinking and
<br />
influence our practical attitudes. We must envision the biosphere as a
<br />
whole ... with mutually reinforcing or mutually destructive
<br />
interdependencies. [We need] a global system of mutually symbiotic
<br />
societies, mapping new conditions into a flexible institutional structure
<br />
and dealing with change through constructive reorganization.&quot;
<br />
<p>a new global morality: &quot;an ethos which does not center on individual good
<br />
and individual value alone, but on the adaptation of mankind as a global
<br />
system, to its new environment.&quot; The need for this new morality, he said,
<br />
was imperative: &quot;We are dealing with emergent realities; no longer with
<br />
isolated groups of men, but with a systematically interdependent global
<br />
community. It is this level of [reality] which we must keep before our eyes
<br />
if we are able to inspire large-scale action designed to assure our
<br />
collective and hence our individual survival&quot;
<br />
<p>to envision the biosphere as a whole, because everyone can perceive and
<br />
comprehend gradually the dynamic features of some aspects of the
<br />
terrestrial surroundings when it is necessary to focus on &quot;the still higher
<br />
systems of animal and plant communities, ecosystems in which the disruption
<br />
of a part jeopardizes the whole&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;We know and control physical forces only too well, biological forces
<br />
tolerably well, and social forces not at all. If, therefore, we could have
<br />
a well-developed science of social systems, it would be the way out of the
<br />
chaos and impending destruction of the present world.&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p><p>However what is very important in these statements is the fact that they
<br />
were derived from the concept of open system which could be considered the
<br />
main conceptual contribution of Bertalanffy searching to comprehend how
<br />
living beings and social organizations should organize their individual
<br />
survival
<br />
<p>Open systems are maintained by &quot;the continuous flow of matter&quot;...&quot;Living
<br />
beings are not in being, they are happening. They are the exprssion of a
<br />
perpetual stream of matter and energy which passes through the organism and
<br />
at the same time constitutes it
<br />
<p>&quot;the organism is not a passive automaton reacting to stimuli but rather is
<br />
an autonomously active system&quot;,
<br />
<p>&quot;In open systems we have not only production of entropy due to irreversible
<br />
processes, but also import of negative entropy. This is the case in the
<br />
living organism which imports [consumes nutrients with] complex molecules
<br />
that are high in free energy. Thus living systems maintaining themselves in
<br />
a steady state, can avoid the increase of entropy, and may even develop
<br />
towards states of increased order and organization.&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p><p><p>In addition Bertalanffy put forward the need of creating a &quot;new image of
<br />
man&quot; emphasizing the decisive role our species can play in shaping its own
<br />
destiny. He based his new image of humanity on evidence that Homo sapiens
<br />
creates and environment of its own out of symbols, and thus humans have the
<br />
ability to direct their own evolution on ethical levels, through the
<br />
cultivation of those symbols we call human values.
<br />
<p>&quot;mechanistic attitudes had seeped into virtually every area of social
<br />
behavior, encouraging doctors to view pacients as cases, employers to
<br />
regard workers as units, advertisers to regard consumers as
<br />
stimulus-response robots, and television programmers to reduce the public
<br />
to a set of demographic numbers&quot;.
<br />
<p>&quot;Man is not only a political creature; he is above all an individual&quot;.
<br />
<p>humanity faces a clear and present danger of being dehumanized, even
<br />
destroyed, by debasing self-images, ...a self-image portraying the human
<br />
being as just another animal would tend to make us indifferent to social
<br />
inequalities and to make us fatalistic about the recurrence of war,
<br />
..human being as merely a physico-chemical machine would tend to justify
<br />
Big Brother techniques of behavior control. &quot;What is badly needed is a
<br />
timely image of man. Since the previous proud image derived from religion
<br />
and philosophy does not serve modern needs efficiently, a new image should
<br />
be synthesized....I would contend that this is a very important business
<br />
indeed---to find out what is actually human&quot;
<br />
<p>humans create their own reality, not because objective reality doesn't
<br />
exist but because human knowledge depends on what humans are able and
<br />
willing to perceive
<br />
<p>&quot;No world view, general systems theory included, is ultimately truth or
<br />
ultimately reality. Each is a perspective or an aspect, with all-too-human
<br />
limitations owing to man's natural and cultural bondage. We cannot jump
<br />
over our own shadow. General Systems Theory is perspectivistic, not a
<br />
&quot;nothing-but&quot; philosophy but a view that is tolerant of other philosophies
<br />
and experiences&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p><p><p>The statements and arguments shown above have been taken from the book
<br />
written by Mark Davidson, whom I thank a lot his endeavor which has allowed
<br />
many systems people (including myself) to realize the greatness of
<br />
Bertalanffy's work.
<br />
<p>Supported by these statements while trying to be aware of time and space
<br />
circumstances I dare to suggest that the Round Table on Bertalanffian
<br />
Thinking (STIQE 2002) might be concerned with
<br />
<p>New Image of Man and Woman
<br />
supported by a new General Anthropology:
<br />
<p>The main question that humans need to examine is to find out what kind of
<br />
women  and men are needed in the 21st century for making possible to
<br />
reconceive how every human individually may develop his/her personality
<br />
taking into account that:
<br />
<p>1)	Other 6 billion individuals must and will as well organize their
<br />
individualities;
<br />
<p>2)	The biodiversity that made possible the emergence of the homo
<br />
sapiens sapiens should be maintained and improved (not at all for making
<br />
profitable business, efficient trade or lucrative financial transactions)
<br />
in order to increase the survival chances of humans on the Earth while
<br />
learning to fairly share the terrestrial environments with all the other
<br />
animals, plants, fungi...;
<br />
<p>3)	The features of the whole planet that made possible the emergence
<br />
of life in this miniscule point of the Universe are not granted forever,
<br />
neither can be preserved whatever humans may imagine they could locally,
<br />
regionally and globally do through their disrupted minds, conditioned by
<br />
selfish ambitions.
<br />
<p>...bearing in mind that there are human minds that have succeeded in
<br />
increasing the danger of dehumanizing humans (through robotomorphism and
<br />
zoomorphism) as Bertalanffy denounced since the 1960s. The trend of actions
<br />
&quot;scientifically&quot; organized in order to design the behavioral engineering
<br />
(Skinner) based on an assumed science of behavior control (Watson) derived
<br />
from the knowledge acquired of conditioned reflexes in rats (Pavlov) has
<br />
been maintained until today with the aim of genetically creating super
<br />
humans who will be served by the society conceived by Skinner &quot;The problem
<br />
is to design a world which will be liked not by people as they are now but
<br />
by those who will live in it&quot; Behaviorism implicitly leads towards
<br />
totalitarianism (either a benevolent one, as in Huxley's Brave New World,
<br />
or a malevolent one, as in Orwell's 1984) that aims at increasing the
<br />
control of people.
<br />
<p>...searching consequently reliable ways for building the interdisciplinary
<br />
enterprise (comprising human biology, psychology, psychiatry, sociology,
<br />
linguistics, economics, the arts,...) that may help to create societal
<br />
circumstances needed for allowing the individual emergence during the life
<br />
of every person searching on his/her own to consciously develop his/her
<br />
peculiar personality, while learning to exert humanely his/her intrinsic
<br />
spontaneity when unavoidably being confronted to diverse cultural, economic
<br />
and social conditions determined peculiarly by the performance of all the
<br />
other humans that constitute every human society,...
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy aware of this danger considered necessary to find out a &quot;new
<br />
science of man&quot; or general anthropology &quot;The image of man is not only a
<br />
theoretical question,... it is a question of the preservation of man as
<br />
human&quot;
