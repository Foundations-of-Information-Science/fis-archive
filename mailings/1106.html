Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>I agree with most of the comments by Luis, John and Andrei. Indeed the 
<br />
conceptual paths in physics around molecular recognition are far from being 
<br />
properly established yet. 'De-geometrizing'  the lock and key mechanical 
<br />
image of the phenomenon (as Luis proposes) and highlighting the 
<br />
oscillatory/resonant/rhythmic nature of both the recognition and the 
<br />
'glueing' that follows would be crucial to fabricate a simplified vision 
<br />
coherent with the quantum mechanical world of underlying processes. Who 
<br />
knows how, but it is there --in the fantastic molecular dynamics that 
<br />
involves coulombian, hydrogen bonding, permanent and induced dipoles, van 
<br />
der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions-- where a symmetry-based analysis 
<br />
should tentatively put the molecular recognition phenomenon (eg, proteins) 
<br />
in a proper quantum footing. In actuality, the problem of 'molecular 
<br />
recognition' would be endowed with a complexity paramount, or even higher, 
<br />
than the very protein-folding problem.
<br />
<p>I disagree, however, with some further comments by Andrei on the 
<br />
non-validity of the second law as a basic principle of the universe 
<br />
---particularly, if one realizes that the 'entropy analysis' is among the 
<br />
very few keys used by contemporary quantum cosmologists in order to make 
<br />
sense of the existentialities beyond the Planck 'frontier', eg, Smolin, 
<br />
Penrose, Hawking. Given that the disagreement involves the role of 
<br />
principles in science (and the apparent disregard of experientia) I suggest 
<br />
postponing this vast discussion until we organize an ad hoc 'information 
<br />
physics' session --actually it is a long overdue discussion. In the 
<br />
interim, I also refer to Igor's message (11 July 2003--fis site: 
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/default.htm">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/</a>) as a more ponderate version but 
<br />
perhaps not so far away from these physico-semiotic views (maybe, the two 
<br />
of them, Andrei and Igor could be the organizers of that focused session?). 
<br />
Tom Stonier had put the relationship entropy-information in the very center 
<br />
of information physics, Morowitz has suggested Pauli's exclusion, and other 
<br />
parties actually take 'uncertainty' as a fundamental spacetime limit for a 
<br />
unitary 'bag of bits'... It would be great that we could establish 
<br />
around  the concepts of information, symmetry, matter, entropy, 
<br />
uncertainty, etc. a central phenomenon for information physics (a 
<br />
'protophenomenon', as Goethe was calling) equivalent to molecular 
<br />
recognition for the bioinformational analysis.
<br />
<p>Because contemplating bioinformation --or the current bioinformatic debates 
<br />
for that matter-- under the molecular recognition prism, opens up very 
<br />
intriguing directions. For instance, the systematic relationship between 
<br />
the generative (genome) and the structural (proteome), together with the 
<br />
crucial role played by communication (signalome), and the supporting web of 
<br />
metabolic transformations (metabolome)... The global picture is a gigantic 
<br />
matrix of molecular recognition interactions, where the most significant 
<br />
controlling molecules (basically, the proteome elements) are no longer mere 
<br />
'catalysts' but multifunctional 'agents' endowed with principal recognition 
<br />
addresses and also secondary ones (dictating the where, when, with whom, 
<br />
how fast, and how long  of the main functionality), all of these addresses 
<br />
are based on recognition capabilities of the component protein-modules. A 
<br />
non-trivial argument is that, along the eukaryotic runaway of fantastic 
<br />
complexity growth, the overall evolutionary regime becomes 
<br />
'transmolecular'... as the only way to explore the universe of 
<br />
developmental paths.
<br />
<p>The new keys that molecular recognition could provide about biomolecular 
<br />
functions imply a very round approach to the whole informational dynamics 
<br />
of life. Seemingly, a new grounding to the emerging information science 
<br />
looms: in the extent to which we win a bioinformation success, &quot;De te 
<br />
fabula narratur&quot; will apply into a constellation of information fields 
<br />
(neuroinformation, socioinformation).
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
