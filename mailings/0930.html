Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This message attempts to tie together several dangling threads of 
<br />
relations generated in earlier discussions.  I respond to Soren, Ted, 
<br />
Pedro and Rafael.
<br />
<p>Soren:  Thank you for your thoughtful response on your views of the 
<br />
place of information.  We agree that a connection exists among the 
<br />
concepts of communication, information, meaning and semiotics.  Let 
<br />
us look deeper than a concept of connection and ask about the 
<br />
possibility of relationships among these  concepts and what we would 
<br />
expect for a conceptual theory which addressed these relationships.
<br />
<p>What would generate coherence among such concepts?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four concepts stem from four different roots - although one 
<br />
could argue that &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;semiotics&quot; are not so distant from 
<br />
one another.
<br />
A coherent theory of information should address these four concepts 
<br />
as well as existing theories of science - commensurate with the 
<br />
pre-existing theories of force, mass, space, time, molecular biology, 
<br />
medical diagnosis and therapy, arts and language and so forth.
<br />
<p>What would be a criteria for theoretical distinctiveness?
<br />
<p>Communication is remarkable for its distinctive forms and 
<br />
consequences.  On the other hand, as we have searched for the essence 
<br />
of information, we have cycled back to mathematical representations 
<br />
and upward to cultural significance.  I remain puzzled by our 
<br />
inability to identity and agree upon the essential qualities of 
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>The issue of (bio)semiotics opens another avenue which we scarcely explored.
<br />
Currently, two primary sets of symbols are used in the natural 
<br />
sciences.  One set of symbols uses logical and mathematical symbols. 
<br />
The chemical symbols, the other set of symbols used for the partially 
<br />
abstract natural sciences, are used in molecular biology and form a 
<br />
basis for the synthesis of biomolecules and biological signalling 
<br />
processes, both internally within the organism and between the 
<br />
organism and its ecoment.  If (bio)semiotics is to become established 
<br />
as a source of description of biological and biomedical information, 
<br />
how will it establish coherence with either of the two existing 
<br />
symbol sets?  Would a biosemiotic symbol set bridge the relations 
<br />
between chemical symbols and mathematical symbols?  A daunting 
<br />
challenge...  What would motivate the creation and acceptance of a 
<br />
third symbol set for biosemiotics?
<br />
<p>The issue of meaning may be the most difficult. Indeed, it is so 
<br />
intertwined with emergence, history, philosophy, cultural structures 
<br />
and related concepts that...???
<br />
<p>Ted:
<br />
<p>The suggestion of focus groups has potential from my perspective. 
<br />
Examination of the options of relations among focus groups could be a 
<br />
starting point.
<br />
<p>Pedro:
<br />
<p>A message via surface mail was sent.
<br />
<p>Rafael:
<br />
<p>Your response on your views of the self of time was carefully 
<br />
articulated but I remain skeptical.  The abstractions of time and 
<br />
space and mass are continuous variables, images of our conceptual 
<br />
domains, as Max Jammer well articulates.  These concepts work 
<br />
together in quantitative structures to bring coherence to physical 
<br />
measurements.  I remain puzzled on how these concepts relate to the 
<br />
logic of chemical or biological processes.
<br />
<p>My closing remark would be simple:
<br />
<p>Coherence within nature is constructed from choices among 
<br />
correspondence relations within nature.  What forces of nature guide 
<br />
the choices of the communities seeking coherence?
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
