<br />
<p><p>Jerry, I have two questions:
<br />
<p>1) Can we conjure, from general systems, complexity theory,
<br />
interference-pattern physics and acoustics, etc., an elegant single statement
<br />
like E=MC squared whose accounting is immediately recognizable in every field
<br />
and specialty by that field's own practitioners and convenient to them?
<br />
<p>2) You've sought, in your bioevolutionary explorations, to distance yourself
<br />
from &quot;Darwinism&quot; and from what you perceived to be my Darwinism.  Is there
<br />
much going on in the world today which cannot be attributed fairly readily to
<br />
one or several of the dynamics conveniently accounted for within broad
<br />
&quot;Darwinian&quot; constraints?
<br />
<p>- - One of my concerns is that when the lid of bioevolutionary pressures
<br />
comes off or normative pressures weaken, although many new options begin to
<br />
emerge most get pruned off. One hope had been, now that humanity has been
<br />
able to move much of the force of evolution from our genes to social
<br />
evolution through learned behaviors, our intelligence could take us to better
<br />
and better ways of living.  That was certainly demonstrated, at least
<br />
temporarily, when the lessons learned from the discovery of why the dinosaurs
<br />
died were applied to prospects of nuclear winter and lead both sides to move
<br />
away from strategic nuclear weapons.  Nonetheless, a look at today's world
<br />
scene presents an apparently increasing prospect that we may be in for a very
<br />
general pruning-off. Hopefully we can identify precisely-enough and perhaps
<br />
redirect the pertinent dynamics.....?

<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 7, 2002
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;WESS is seeking to assemble a set of the fundamental questions that
<br />
&nbsp;are guiding research and debate on emerging and evolving complex
<br />
&nbsp;systems. We seek to focus our inquiry on such questions that are
<br />
&nbsp;fundamental to physical, chemical, biological, social and cultural
<br />
&nbsp;emergence.  We seek your contributions to enhancing our understanding
<br />
&nbsp;of the current state of affairs and to creating our agenda.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;The Washington Evolutionary Systems Society (WESS) has existed for
<br />
&nbsp;nearly two decades.  During our history, we have discussed and
<br />
&nbsp;debated a wide range of concepts and ideas related to evolutionary
<br />
&nbsp;systems. Concomitantly, a gradual shift in the public perceptions of
<br />
&nbsp;science and scientific philosophies has occurred.  How will these
<br />
&nbsp;perceptions evolve in the next three years? five years? ten years?
<br />
&nbsp;fifty years?  What can WESS contribute to these emerging public
<br />
&nbsp;discussions?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;The professional activities of WESS members contribute to the
<br />
&nbsp;progress of evolutionary thought in a wide range of disciplines.
<br />
&nbsp;These contributions place our membership in positions to evaluate the
<br />
&nbsp;immediate, intermediate and long range futures of their disciplines
<br />
&nbsp;and hence to contribute to the construction of a list of critical
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;open questions&quot;.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;What are the critical questions facing your discipline?  Which
<br />
&nbsp;questions are being addressed by the leading scholars in your
<br />
&nbsp;discipline and in closely related disciplines?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Please make a short list of the fundamental open questions in your
<br />
&nbsp;field of inquiry.  In particular, what important questions are not
<br />
&nbsp;being adequately addressed?  Short explanation of the reasoning
<br />
&nbsp;supporting the critical nature of these questions for the future of
<br />
&nbsp;your discipline are welcomed.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Please forward your contribution to me at the return address on this email.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;A preliminary discussion of the proposed critical questions will be
<br />
&nbsp;discussed by the participants in WESSbook on  Saturday, March 16,
<br />
&nbsp;2002.  The meeting will be held at 1:30 PM in room 284 of the Reiss
<br />
&nbsp;Sciences Building on the Georgetown University Campus in Washington,
<br />
&nbsp;D.C..
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local members are invited to make short presentations (10 - 15
<br />
&nbsp;minutes) to the WESSbook meeting to help create the forum for future
<br />
&nbsp;discussions.  If you desire to contribute to the open discussion,
<br />
&nbsp;please email or call at your earliest convenience
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Two suggestions:  If you know colleagues who share our interests,
<br />
&nbsp;feel free to invite them to submit their contributions as well.
<br />
&nbsp;Secondly, your suggestions of either recent or classical books which
<br />
&nbsp;address or develop the questions of concern to you and references to
<br />
&nbsp;such books would be welcomed along with your conceptual questions.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;For further information or discussion, please call me at 703-790-1651.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Cheers
