<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks to Christian, Godó, Christophe, Heiner, and Elohimjl for their 
<br />
further comments. There are quite many exciting motifs to think about (plus 
<br />
today's fresh postings, from John H, and John C--great thoughts on 
<br />
optimality!).  In my opinion, finding a good way of grouping complexities 
<br />
(or hiding our problems under adequate rugs), would help a quite a lot 
<br />
these socioinfo discussions.
<br />
<p>Most of the messages were taking our linguistic/symbolic capabilities as 
<br />
the socioinfo starting point, and I really agree. Indeed we could rename 
<br />
Homo sapiens as Homo loquens. The circulating info (or communication) 
<br />
in  the natural human communities is basically the spoken language, 
<br />
although not only: an enormously rich set of facial expressions (eyes!), 
<br />
postures, emotional utterances, laughter and crying, manual signs ('talking 
<br />
hands'), odors, etc. accompany the symbolic communication. Seemingly, if we 
<br />
enter into language, a universe of unsolved discussions is waiting for 
<br />
us--and even if we enter into the very modest province of laughter, pretty 
<br />
nice unsolved questions are lurching there too; or in the recent 
<br />
discoveries about human pheromone communication... But perhaps all the 
<br />
elements of this heterogeneous conglomerate have in common a 'natural', 
<br />
gene related, species-specific character. I would suggest we label this 
<br />
vast class of phenomena as the 'endogenous' info of our species. Our 
<br />
natural setting of communication tools and relationships.
<br />
<p>Then, human societies, after starting the runaway process of cultural 
<br />
evolution with the invention of artificial ecosystems (see Diamond-1996), 
<br />
become capable of --or 'necessity' forces them to-- advancing new forms of 
<br />
external information ('exoinformation') that complement the communication 
<br />
effects of the endogenous core. For instance, durability, transportability, 
<br />
contemplability, compactability... Numbers and pictographic writing would 
<br />
be one of the first exoinformation ('artificial') wrappings around the 
<br />
endogenous info of human communities. Quite many other items and ad hoc 
<br />
artifacts have joined in: alphabets, printing press and computers appearing 
<br />
historically as the exoinfo crown inventions.
<br />
<p>Both forms, the endo and the exo, are densely intertwined. The former 
<br />
provides the intangible and ever-changing meaning, while the second, 
<br />
external to the subject, becomes objectivable, measurable, transmissible, 
<br />
digitalizable (quite often), etc. The exoinformation form, through human 
<br />
agency, can be extended almost indefinitely, and apparently gets a life in 
<br />
its own, vicariously however (the 'meme' conceptualization would not be so 
<br />
terrific, after all). The exo form, although it appears as a new, 
<br />
independent world, is always referring to the magmatic endo world; and even 
<br />
the most sophisticate class of exoinformation, such as science itself, 
<br />
relates to communities and invisible colleges who have to validate 
<br />
groupally the occurring changes and novelties.
<br />
<p>The relationship of 'knowledge' with both classes of info --implicit in the 
<br />
previous paragraph-- could be quite intriguing (perhaps too complex, as 
<br />
usual). Some of McLuhan's views on communication could be discussed in this 
<br />
context too. He was a great pioneer, but maybe some other more recent works 
<br />
--Hobart &amp; Schiffman, 1998, 'Information Ages'-- would get closer to this 
<br />
distinction between two classes of social information involved into strange 
<br />
mutual processes and balances.
<br />
<p>Needless to day, the artificial exoinformation wrapping, taken to the 
<br />
extreme, becomes a hypertrophic exoskeleton that suffocates the 'real' endo 
<br />
life inside... Perhaps this is one of the problems of our times. The 
<br />
'information society' dumps us too much exo for our modest condition of 
<br />
Homo loquens.
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
