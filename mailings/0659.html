Theses on the Place of Purpose in Nature
<br />
<p>(1) Almost all human actions appear to have a means-ends structure.  The
<br />
ends (or &quot;goals&quot; or &quot;purposes&quot;) of our actions establish normative
<br />
criteria in relation to which our actions may be said to &quot;succeed&quot; or
<br />
&quot;fail.&quot;  But are such human purposes real or illusory?
<br />
<p>(2) If they are illusory, then how do we explain the fact that the very
<br />
notion of an &quot;illusion&quot; is itself normative, since it implies a
<br />
veridical cognitive state with respect to which the illusory state is
<br />
deviant?
<br />
<p>(3) If human purposes are real, then we must try to explain them by
<br />
seeking their roots further down the phylogenetic scale. But how far
<br />
down? At least at the level of the cell, because the means-ends
<br />
structure is clearly observable in the behavior of the cell. This is a
<br />
simple empirical fact. Nothing is implied about any possible (but
<br />
unknowable) subjective experience that may or may not be accompanying
<br />
this behavior.
<br />
<p>(4) Clearly life is a cell-level phenomenon, but equally clearly much,
<br />
if not most, activity at the subcellular level has a means-ends
<br />
structure, as well. Furthermore, some aspect of the self-organizing
<br />
principle at the heart of the phenomenon of life---whatever it turns out
<br />
to be---must be postulated to exist below the cell level, if we are to
<br />
have any hope of explaining the origin of life. There is no way to get
<br />
from random chemistry to the cell without positing a stepwise,
<br />
self-organizing process. So these are two good reasons for postulating
<br />
some autonomous, proto-means-ends principle at the below-cell level, as
<br />
well.
<br />
<p>(5) Isn't the cell just a &quot;machine&quot;? No, because in a machine there is
<br />
no intrinsic connection between the normative or &quot;correct&quot; functional
<br />
state and its material instantiation. The correct state is imposed on
<br />
the matter from the outside as a set of boundary conditions that are
<br />
arbitrary with respect to the desired functional behavior.  There is no
<br />
principle intrinsic to the machine tending to preserve the correct
<br />
boundary conditions or the correct behavior. That is why external
<br />
intervention is required---the correctness is entirely in the eye of the
<br />
human being. The machine itself does not give a damn (so to speak) about
<br />
its functional state, which is only &quot;functional&quot; because we say it is.
<br />
<p>(6) The functional behavior of the cell, in contrast, arises out of the
<br />
intrinsic physical properties of the matter the cell is made of. The
<br />
relationship between structure and function in a protein is not
<br />
arbitrary and extrinsic, as in a machine, but rather essential and
<br />
intrinsic. The result of this intrinsic connection between structure and
<br />
function in the cell is that living things are constantly actively
<br />
adjusting all their internal processes in such a way as to preserve
<br />
their global stability. We describe this as the &quot;struggle to survive.&quot;
<br />
This fact is not mentioned as a solution to anything; it is merely a
<br />
description of an empirically observable phenomenon. It is the heart of
<br />
the problem that we need to solve.
<br />
<p>(7) The problem clearly transcends ordinary biochemistry, because the
<br />
cell is not just minimizing energy. Rather, it is deploying energy
<br />
(doing work), using informational means, to achieve the end of
<br />
preserving global stability. If &quot;agency&quot; means acting spontaneously by
<br />
virtue of one's own causal powers, and if &quot;intelligence&quot; means adjusting
<br />
means to ends, then the cell is clearly an &quot;intelligent agent.&quot;
<br />
<p>(8) Doesn't natural selection remove the necessity for speaking about
<br />
&quot;purpose&quot;?  No, because selection theory always presupposes the
<br />
functional integrity of the system being &quot;selected.&quot; It is this
<br />
assumption of comparatively superior functioning that is really doing
<br />
all the explanatory work. Since selection theory presupposes the
<br />
normativity of organismal function, it cannot explain it.
<br />
<p>(9) What would an alternative to the reductionist, neo-Darwinian
<br />
framework look like? Here is one possible answer:
<br />
<p>&quot;At present, protein structure, metabolic sequences, and cytoplasmic
<br />
streaming are regarded as disparate subjects . . . It is, of course,
<br />
possible . . . that the cell functions by adopting average situations
<br />
which result from summation of all the independent processes operating
<br />
at a given moment. It is, however, unlikely that this mode of function
<br />
could explain the ordered movement exhibited by cells. Subcellular
<br />
movement takes place as though directed by an underlying co-ordination,
<br />
implying a unifying principle which links metabolic chemical energy
<br />
reciprocally with macroscopic mechanical forces. This principle is
<br />
clearly one of structure existing throughout subcellular space, and of
<br />
all subcellular components, I think that water is the only one capable
<br />
of fulfulling this role.&quot; (John G. Watterson, &quot;The Interactions of Water
<br />
and Proteins in Cellular Function,&quot; in P. Jeanteur et al., eds.,
<br />
Progress in Molecular and Subcellular Biology, Vol. 12, Berlin:
<br />
Springer, 1991, pp. 113--134; the quote is on pp. 130--131.)
<br />
<p>Watterson's own speculations focus on the possible large-scale
<br />
organization of an ordered water (or liquid crystalline) state in the
<br />
cytoplasmic gel. (See, also, Mae-Wan Ho et al., &quot;Organisms as Polyphasic
<br />
Liquid Crystals,&quot; Bioelectrochemistry and Bioenergetics, 1996, 41:
<br />
81--91; and Gerald H. Pollack's &quot;Cells, Gels, and the Engines of Life,&quot;
<br />
Seattle: Ebner &amp; Sons, 2001.)
<br />
<p>For other speculations on the coherence of biological functionality that
<br />
invoke a variety of nonlinear dynamical and quantum field theoretic
<br />
principles, see the writings of F. Eugene Yates, G. Ricky Welch, A.S.
<br />
Davydov, Herbert Frohlich, Emilio Del Giudice, Giuliano Preparata,
<br />
Giuseppe Vitiello, Robert Laughlin, and others (I will be happy to
<br />
supply references if anyone is interested).
<br />
<p>(10) Belief in the necessity of a physical principle underlying the
<br />
functional coherence of life does not stand or fall with any particular
<br />
theory about the nature of that principle. We can very well know that
<br />
the currently dominant theoretical framework is broken, even if we don't
<br />
know for sure how to fix it.
<br />
<p>(11) Renaming a problem (e.g., &quot;teleonomy&quot;) does solve it. I think it is
<br />
better to call a spade a spade. That is why I speak of &quot;purpose,&quot;
<br />
&quot;teleology,&quot; &quot;intelligent agency,&quot; etc.
<br />
<p>(12) Is this &quot;anthropomorphism&quot;? No, because if &quot;ho anthropos&quot; is itself
<br />
a product of nature, then human nature must already be latent within
<br />
life and the cosmos at large. To ban the investigation of purpose at
<br />
lower levels of life is to make it impossible to understand ourselves
<br />
naturalistically.
<br />
<p>(13) As Whitehead noted, &quot;Scientists animated by the purpose of proving
<br />
that they are purposeless constitute an interesting subject for study.&quot;
<br />
