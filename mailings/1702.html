<p>
I’d like to address Aleks’ third point about mathematics having drifted into 
<br />
senescence because nobody is questioning this move towards greater and 
<br />
greater discretization. I believe this is no longer true. There is a 
<br />
fledgling field within cognitive psychology called “mathematical idea 
<br />
analysis,” outlined by George Lakoff and Ralph Nunez in their 2002 book, 
<br />
“Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics Into 
<br />
Being.” The authors claim that all abstract theory is embodied in origin and 
<br />
so begins concretely as sensorimotor experience during infancy that is 
<br />
systematically bootlegged into abstraction with maturation, both 
<br />
individually and collectively.
<br />
<p>Within mathematics, not even so basic a concept as number is immune. At 
<br />
least three entirely different metaphors for number exist --“objects in a 
<br />
set,” “points on a line,” and “units of measurement.” Lakoff and Nunez show 
<br />
how entailments from each metaphor, plus blends between them, pave the way 
<br />
for entirely different branches of study. What is particularly interesting 
<br />
is how different foundational metaphors can result in INCOMPATIBLE notions 
<br />
of similar concepts, such as that of infinity. On the one hand, Newton’s 
<br />
method of limits in calculus and entailments by Cantor lead to the notion of 
<br />
transfinite numbers, including different sizes of infinity. On the other 
<br />
hand, metaphors available through Leibniz’s alternative method of calculus 
<br />
lead to the notion of infinitesimals. Entailments extending the metaphor to 
<br />
granular numbers, posit a system of immeasurably “huge” numbers 
<br />
incommensurate with the transfinites.
<br />
<p>It seems to me that such an approach allows for a less reified, more fluid 
<br />
view, than one which takes for granted this relentless enterprise of 
<br />
breaking the universe up into smaller and smaller discrete objects. Rather 
<br />
than applying the agenda of discretization to the continuity of things, 
<br />
perhaps this notion of conscilience that we are discussing relates to a 
<br />
figure/ground reversal, by applying the agenda of making more continuous 
<br />
that which has previously viewed as discrete.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />

<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some random thoughts:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. Independent reinvention: another path to consilience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Two years ago, I have been trying to solve a particular problem in machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;learning, my field of research. Looking around, I found a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generalization of mutual information, which was constructed by my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;colleague.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I performed numerous experiments, and it performed well. Then I tried to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;check if anyone thought of that before, and, empowered by Google, I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;surprised to find virtually the same formula (re)invented independently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different names over the past 50 years in: biology (Quastler), psychology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(McGill), information theory (Han, Yeung), physics (Kikuchi,Cerf&amp;Adami
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arXiv:quant-ph/9605002), neuroscience (Brenner), robotics (Yairi et al), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;closely related notions in game theory (Grabisch &amp; Roubens), complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory (Gell-Mann), statistics (Darroch), and chemistry (Kirkwood). I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;go on, but I wonder how many I already missed.  Most researchers, but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all, arrived at it by employing the inclusion-exclusion principle outside 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strict context of set theory. That was my encounter with consilience: but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was not a discovery of applicability of a different method in an unexpected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;domain, but the independent discovery of the same hypothesis (actually a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tool) in a number of different domains: isn't this the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Hierarchies of sciences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps that is demonstration enough that vertical integration is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beneficial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if not necessary. And here come in Pedro's diagrams of sciences. I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see a need for politically correct circularity. I also agree with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;optimistic viewpoint that there needs to be only a single vertical field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that provides the cognitive &quot;tools&quot; (which are, however, psychologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;feasible) to all the horizontal fields. Role models already exist: logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematics and statistics (and philosophy that studies their foundations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a side note, I found Pedro's reference to circle of knowledge very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting. There, religion and philosophy are in the center. Where is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;religion today? While philosophy sets the framework for what and how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think, religion answers the Why?. While some people could involve in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite regress of why why why, most stop recursing at a certain level and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;move forward. Religion is a formal setting of this direction, combining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the informal herding behavior. Ultimately the quality of this direction is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;judged by survival and growth of both the religion and its followers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. Objects reified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematics and logic, for one, have been cast in stone. Nobody dares
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question the fundamentals anymore, it would be unimaginable throwing all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that away. This seems like a proof of Stan's senescence. Mathematics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic are all discrete, based on objects and their behavior. Probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory, too, is discrete, with the division of the universe into discrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events. And without probability theory, there is no statistical notions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information or entropy. If you now look at the natural world, you don't see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects: you see the fuzz of interlocking leaves, the swaying fur of grass,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the smooth gusting of wind, swarming of flies, the gritty mess of mud, soil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and pebbles on the ground, the swirling stream, the foamy foam.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you turn and look at a urban landscape: objects (discrete buildings),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects (discrete chair), objects (discrete road-side signs), objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(discrete potted plants), objects (discrete buttons), objects (discrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans), objects (discrete molecules of air), objects (discrete plant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species), objects (discrete knots of wind speed), objects (centimeters of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;leaf surface area), objects (zeros and ones encoding the music on a CD),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pummeling of photons, cascading of electrons. We don't know what there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inside an atom, but surely it's objects, and objects within them. Computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are engineered so that everything is fully deterministic and predictable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and there is nothing that is not an unnested discrete binary object, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equal, all egalitarian.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We're trying to fit every aspect of nature to objects and to relationships
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between them. The problems we have with concepts like continuity (what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinity? what is zero? what is divide-by-zero?), forces, fields,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships and interactions (are two particles interacting at a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or are they really a single object? is a molecule of my body an independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecule or is it my body?) are a kludge retrofitted on objects that tries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to capture everything that objects alone miss. Indeed, our representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have senesced, and all we will ever do will be in the context of objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*Can* we think in some other way than by reifying objects, or has our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cognition senesced a long time ago? If computers don't, do we still have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;freedom to think in non-objects? Fuzzy logic is not an answer: every fuzzy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variable is still an object: either it's hot or it is not, two values, two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects. Just as in logic, a hypothesis is either perfectly true or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perfectly false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You might wonder for a few seconds, perhaps admit it, but you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certainly not want to work in this direction. Life's too short and that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;senescence.
