<br />
<p><p>Is the manifest existence of experience in the world to be mastered  
<br />
only by poets and priests, or is its mystery one that science can  
<br />
disclose?
<br />
<p>Before 1950 the answer was clear, experience lay at the foundation  
<br />
of  scientific consideration. But the challenge of it seemed  
<br />
unsurmountable.
<br />
<p>In 1928, the philosopher of science, Rudolf Carnap, wrote:
<br />
<p>&quot;The question is this: provided that to all or some types of  
<br />
psychological processes there correspond simultaneous processes in  
<br />
the central nervous system, what connects the processes in question  
<br />
with one another? Very little has been done toward a solution to the  
<br />
correlation problem of the psychophysical relation, but, even if this  
<br />
problem were solved (i.e., if we could infer the characteristics of a  
<br />
brain process from the characteristics of a psychological process,  
<br />
and vice versa), nothing would have been achieved to further the  
<br />
solution of the essence problem (i.e., the psychophysical problem).  
<br />
For this problem is not concerned with the correlation, but with the  
<br />
essential relation; that is, with that which &quot;essentially&quot; or  
<br />
&quot;fundamentally&quot; leads from one process to the other or which brings  
<br />
forth both from a common root.
<br />
<p>...there still remain, in the main, three hypotheses: mutual  
<br />
influence, parallelism, and identity in the sense of the two aspect  
<br />
theory...
<br />
<p>Three contradicting and unsatisfactory answers and no possibility of  
<br />
finding or even imagining an empirical fact that could here make the  
<br />
difference: a more hopeless situation can hardly be imagined...&quot;
<br />
<p>Rudolf Carnap, P. 37-38. The Logical Structure of the World. 1928.
<br />
<p>Since 1928 a lot of work has been done in neuroscience on what Carnap  
<br />
calls the “correlation problem.” We have identified behavior in the  
<br />
nervous system that corresponds to certain psychological processes.  
<br />
But, as Carnap anticipated, no progress has been made on the  
<br />
essential problem.
<br />
<p>In workshops and seminars the Institute for Advanced Science &amp;  
<br />
Engineering aims to bring together leading theorists, logicians and  
<br />
computer scientists, with empirical research in biology and physics  
<br />
to ask some of the harder questions regarding the foundations of  
<br />
logic and apprehension, with the ultimate goal of addressing what is,  
<br />
perhaps, the last remaining really hard problem in science and moving  
<br />
toward a demonstrable explanation of experience in nature.
<br />
<p>This series of lecture/discussions is a prelude to our workshop in  
<br />
December. Speakers from multiple disciplines are invited to present  
<br />
in the context the Institute's theme, &quot;Explaining Experience in  
<br />
Nature.&quot; The format of this series of lectures/debates consists of a  
<br />
40 minute lecture followed by a led discussion and debate.
<br />
<p>Professor Michael Friedman, a leading scholar of the history of  
<br />
logical positivism, gives our inaugural talk on the positivist  
<br />
agenda. He is Frederick P. Rehmus Family Professor of Humanities at  
<br />
Stanford University and is the author of Reconsidering Logical  
<br />
Positivism published in 1999 by Cambridge University Press. For more  
<br />
information about Professor Friedman see his Stanford University  
<br />
profile.
