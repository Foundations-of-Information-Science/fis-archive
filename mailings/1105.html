Dear All
<br />
<p>Allow me to draw your attension to the Heinz von Foerster conference in Vienna 10-15.Th of November and to my new mail and affiliation. Bee below here or in better orgnized form in the attachment.
<br />
<p>CONFERENCE THEMES
<br />
Monday, November 10
<br />
The Imperative of Change:
<br />
If you wish to remain yourself, change!
<br />
Heinz von Foerster's  Imperative concerning change, which he referred to as the &quot;Therapeutic Imperative&quot; appears as a paradox: how can one both change and remain the same?  Heinz von Foerster answers this question by appealing to the 2,600 year old wisdom of the I Ching.  Under the hexagram Fu, the turning point, it says &quot;The ultimate frame for change is the unchanging.&quot; (The &quot;Paris Paper&quot;, Ethics and Second Order Cybernetics, 1990)
<br />
<p><p>Tuesday, November  11  
<br />
The Imperative of Learning:
<br />
If you wish to see, learn to act!    
<br />
Heinz von Foerster's &quot;Aesthetic Imperative&quot; Imperative addresses learning.  Since we can only sense when we actively engage with our world, then learning can only arise through action.  Simply acting, without awareness of consequence is the provenance of all living things.  Humans can be aware of what they do, why, and how.  Humans can also be aware that they are constitute their own worlds through their living, and this inclusion of the observing as constituting the observed system is a characteristic of second order cybernetics.  Thus we understand that doing and knowing, are always in an endless circular relashionship which manifests as life and learning.
<br />
<p>Wednesday,  November 12 
<br />
The Ethical Imperative:
<br />
Always act to increase the number of possibilities!
<br />
Heinz von Foerster's best known Imperative concerns ethical behaviour. He developed it for himself, as the best way he could imagine guiding his own behaviour in the face of never claiming access to any ultimate &quot;right&quot;; namely to act  always in a way which increased the number of possibilities.  Given that he saw himself as part of the universe, he could not claim that he or anyone has acces to some ultimate truth.
