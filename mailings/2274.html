Dear Igor:
<br />
<p>Your reponse includes many threads of science and philosophy that are  
<br />
co-mingled with mathematical concepts.
<br />
The usage of language co-mingles many concepts that must be kept  
<br />
separate if one is to conceptualize a theory of biological  
<br />
information that includes calculations of the genetic structures and  
<br />
reproductive metabolism.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few comments which may provide you some concrete examples that  
<br />
separate our world views, particularly about mathematics. Your  
<br />
philosophy of mathematics is a rather traditional one in the physical  
<br />
world.  I have sought to explain why this view of continuous  
<br />
mathematics is not adequate for discrete relations among electro- 
<br />
chemical particles, electrochemical individuals we call the chemical  
<br />
elements.
<br />
<p>If you are serious about understanding the mathematical distinction,   
<br />
I suggest you attempt to use the atomic number in basic arithmetic,  
<br />
such as the distributive law and the commutative law.
<br />
<p>I suggest you demonstrate how your view of mathematics applies to  
<br />
these numbers and report back to the list your conclusions.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A cell mechanism A adapts (measures) to the cell environment, which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is part of. During this adaptation it increases its complexity

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also increases its complexity. Given that there are many such

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; membranes, etc), each mechanism increases its complexity by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflecting on the presence of the totality of the other mechanisms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; JLRC:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reading your words from a 'big picture' frame of mind, I concur.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would prefer to express the concepts in terms of the flow of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrical particles...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It may be flow of electric particles, e.g. &quot;measurement&quot; as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exchange of electrons or radicals in chemical reactions, which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to saturations of concentrations of products and thus changes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the environment;
</em><br />
The concept of &quot;measurement&quot; is hardly a natural concept of  
<br />
information.  Measurement is a concept introduced with the French  
<br />
revolution and the international units of the decimal system.   
<br />
Unfortunately, chemical measures are based firstly on the natural  
<br />
units of elements and only secondarily on the concept of mass.   
<br />
Electrical flows are intrinsic to chemical structures and do not  
<br />
depend on saturation, etc.  Flow is merely motion, is it not?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It may be flow of photons, e.g. photosyntetic apparatus of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; green plants &quot;measures&quot; the incident light by producing flow of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protons further used in ATP production and flow of electrons for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NADPH production. These flows change, for example, the pH in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain parts of chloroplast, which, in turn, changes the flows  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves, including the available photon flow by, for example,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epoxydation/deepoxydation of xantofills, &quot;screening&quot; photosystems  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from light;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It may be flow of ions (changes in the state of the neuron  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through activity of calcium and potassium channels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It may be flow of genetic information, e.g. transcription of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RNA as a reaction to change in the cell environment, which leads to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; production of enzymes, which, in turn, modify this cell environment  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (e.g. reaction to heat shock or to strong light)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many more examples possible...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In all these cases change, occuring as a reaction to a certain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flow, is a measurement of this flow, and it, in turn, forces the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes to this flow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, one may say that most of these phenomena deal with either  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flows of charged particles or photons. This is, however, trivial.
</em><br />
Trivial?  If these electrical flows are trivial, perhaps you may wish  
<br />
to write the equations for reproduction of a cell in terms of these  
<br />
flows.
<br />
Are you conflating the possibility of a philosophical narrative with  
<br />
doing science?  In the FIS case, we would like to calculate  
<br />
information content in a cell?  If this is a trivial matter, please  
<br />
demonstrate how you would address the problem.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, there exist only 4 force fields -- electromagnetic,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity, strong and weak. In case of living matter, at the level of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description of biomolecular networks, we deal only with the first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one, with electromagnetic field.
</em><br />
As far as I am aware, no conclusive evidence can be provided that  
<br />
ONLY four force fields exist.  Perhaps you mean to say that thus far,  
<br />
physicists have not found a way to view the term &quot;force field&quot; in a  
<br />
unified way and thus create a narrative that justifies a statement  
<br />
that at least four distinctions are necessary.
<br />
<p>I have no idea why you reject a gravitational field in bio networks.   
<br />
For example, our blood pressure adapt when we move from a reclining  
<br />
to an upright position.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence, the only material objects that really matter are those which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interact with the electromagnetic field or are produced by it, i.e.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photons and charges (ions and electrons)
</em><br />
This is an intersting philosophy of science.  I disagree.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The term &quot;mechanism&quot; can be used in either a mathematical sense, a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical sense, or a general sense.  In what sense is it being used  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this paragraph?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I say &quot;mechanism&quot; I mean:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      a chemical system of interactions between the biomolecules,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ions and quanta, NECESSARILY in the structural context, i.e. in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organelles and compartments, where such interaction happen.
</em><br />
(This is not a Newtonian description but rather a jargon or usage  
<br />
defined within chemistry; this usage obscures the relations between  
<br />
matter, electrical flow, time and space and genetics.  It is a nice  
<br />
narrative.)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;      a mathematical abstraction in the form of system of equations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the biochemical networks, that represents our understanding of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the above.
</em><br />
A foundation question for FIS is precisely the relation between these  
<br />
two sentences.  Can you calculate it?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nature as such does not know equations and networks,
</em><br />
Are you placing man outside of nature?  Man (scientists) are emergent  
<br />
from chemical systems and as part of nature we know how simple  
<br />
equations and simple networks work.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; these are means of our interpretation of what happens out there. I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that this is more or less in line with Robert Rosen's views.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
My reading of Robert Rosens texts is radically different than yours.   
<br />
I am referring to two texts, &quot;Life Itself&quot; and &quot;Anticipatory  
<br />
Systems&quot;.  Which texts are you referring to?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More specifically, in the narrative you provide, how does one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create relations between electrical particles and the dynamics of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bionetworks?  Although only a small number of different electrical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles exist, how does one create the range of organisms in an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ecosystem?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As it is known from the theory of systems (examples being Lorentz  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attractor and other strange attractors, swarm theory, fractal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures, and many many more), it is quite possible to develop  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very complex systems from very small number of simple elements. The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of this complexity is the nonlinearity and instability of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system, or, in a more mathematical sense, the positive Lyapunov  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exponential in a finite and bounded phase space. It is, for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, known, that all possible patterns on the sea shells may be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reproduced in modeling by means of a system of two simple nonlinear  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations (this was in Journal of Theoretical Biology some time in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1987). Please also refer to the works of Karl Simms (&quot;virtual  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creatures&quot;) and works in experimental mathematics of evolution by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chris Langton and other guys from Santa Fe institute.
</em><br />
A clear example of what you mean would be a calculation.
<br />
For example, calculate the number of isomers of (alpha) NAD to show  
<br />
how the methods work.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another argument: One needs only 0 and 1 values for the bit to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convey in a string of bits as much information as one needs to.
</em><br />
If this were true, how much information is in an NAD molecule?   
<br />
Please show how you would start with Shannon information and  
<br />
calculate a value.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can we make such concepts EXACT such that they become a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful method of scientific prediction?  This is the challenge  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for bionetworks at all levels of perplexity.  How does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuality arise from such a narrative?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that we are oftentimes dealing here with the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unstable non-equilibrium systems which are deterministic but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unpredictable.
</em><br />
Are you aware that chemical structures can not be entered into  
<br />
Thermodynamics?  Only the ratio of concentrations of a specified  
<br />
reaction can be transferred from chemical theory into continuous  
<br />
mathematical equations. .
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that we cannot predict their behavior but can explain it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; afterwards.
</em><br />
A very interesting remark.   The remark reminds me of my children  
<br />
when they were teenagers.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A good example is the game of pool. It is absolutely impossible to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict (before the stroke is made) exactly where each ball lands  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the first stroke made into the &quot;triangle&quot; of balls. However,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the interactions, of course, obey Newtonian laws, and backward  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstruction of the process is possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Same with evolution of biological systems and, in a way, with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bionetworks.
</em><br />
I fail to see any meaningful comparison between a game of pool and  
<br />
emergence of life and biological reproduction.  For example, what is  
<br />
the correspondence between a genetic system and the forces of a fixed  
<br />
set of inelastic collisions?  No generative operations are needed to  
<br />
describe a pool game.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only general features of it may be probabilistically predicted. And  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is exactly how the individuality comes into picture. Had it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not been for these instabilities and extreme sensitivity to small  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variations in initial and boundary conditions, we would have been  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all alike and all the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Igor:  Your belief in mathematical appears to me to be full, complete  
<br />
and totally classical physics.
<br />
<p>The challenge to you is to tackle some real chemical and biological  
<br />
problems to test your theories, EXACTLY.  Narratives are easy to  
<br />
generate but the real test is in calculations.  If Poincare was  
<br />
correct, you have some real challenges.
<br />
<p>I would add that chemical theory provides an exact method of  
<br />
calculation of electrical flows as well as the representation of  
<br />
electrical particles in chemical structures.  The consequences of  
<br />
chemical calculations is a collection of relations that become the  
<br />
starting point for physical calculations attempting to describe the  
<br />
motion of the electrical particles in time and space.  The chemical  
<br />
calculations are antecedent to physical calculations.
<br />
<p>Two other comments:
<br />
<p>1. I use the word 'exactly' to mean EXACTLY, not approximately.
<br />
<p>2. One of the philosophical differences between your world view and  
<br />
mine is that revealed by the ancient distinction between species and  
<br />
genera.  It appears that you view mathematical generalities as  
<br />
universally applicable.  I view the world as composed from species.   
<br />
Classical mathematical generalities are seldom applicable exactly to  
<br />
chemical or biological species.  (or, was Poincare wrong?)
<br />
<p>Of course, I could be wrong... if you can calculate the number of  
<br />
isomers of NAD using classical mathematical combinatorics, I would be  
<br />
forced to reconsider the entire structure of my logic.   (And  
<br />
chemical sciences would have to reconsider the nature of valence.)
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
