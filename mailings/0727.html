Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>The recent series of posts on opinions, knowledge and logics 
<br />
stimulate one to compare the differences between scientific logics 
<br />
and other practises in other disciplines.
<br />
<p>The gradual accrual of scientific knowledge over the centuries can be 
<br />
associated with the development of scientific technologies - some of 
<br />
which promote the human weal.  A critical component of the history of 
<br />
science and the traditions of scientific research is the free 
<br />
exchange of precise information on the circumstances surrounding 
<br />
experiments, measurements, and observations.  The free communication 
<br />
of information within a community promotes the development of a 
<br />
community with common methods of approach and reasoning. 
<br />
Mathematical logic contributes to the genesis of descriptive 
<br />
rationals of experiments and observations.   A critical aspect of the 
<br />
scientific approach to logic is that the openness of the systems 
<br />
allows skeptics (of any persuasion) to repeat critical observations 
<br />
and to come to their own conclusions.   Over sufficiently long 
<br />
durations, this method of developing a scientific logic is judged to 
<br />
be successful.  It is an open process and is transparent to all those 
<br />
who seek to explore the mysteries of nature.
<br />
<p>The accrual of mathematical knowledge is remarkably similar; however, 
<br />
the nature of mathematical logic (model theory) appears to develop 
<br />
from the internal coherence among logic, symbols, language and 
<br />
external events / processes in the non-mathematical world.  The 
<br />
capability to re-produce the logic of a proof is considered the basic 
<br />
test of its validity.
<br />
<p>The deep intertwining, interweaving and interlacing of the logic 
<br />
structures of science and the logic structures of mathematics are 
<br />
mutually re-enforcing toward one another.  New observations in 
<br />
science stimulate new observations in mathematics and vice versa. 
<br />
The cumulative success of these relationships is among the 
<br />
foundational pillars of the informational sciences such as FIS. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the perspective of the concepts of &quot;Organic Communication&quot;, I 
</em><br />
note the deep similarity between the conceptual dynamics of organic 
<br />
communication in living systems and the corresponding conceptual 
<br />
dynamics of generating logical communications.
<br />
<p>Recent posts to this list have included several highly personalized 
<br />
narratives about personal perspective of logic.  Most remarkably, 
<br />
these postings have included the intertwining of specialized local 
<br />
knowledge restricted to highly restrictive presuppositions of 
<br />
individual philosophers.  One can obscure the deeper issues relating 
<br />
scientific activity and logic by introducing related topics, such as 
<br />
causality.  Such tightly focused definitions (grounded in personal 
<br />
philosophies) are remote from both modern science and the traditional 
<br />
processes of science.
<br />
<p>Norbert introduces another point of view by suggesting that nature is 
<br />
intrinsically logical.  I am uncertain of the precise  nature of the 
<br />
definitions  that Norbert is using.  Many, many varieties of 
<br />
mathematical logic exist.  If a system has a &quot;logic&quot; what are the 
<br />
manifestations of this logic?  Is the logic of a system based on 
<br />
formal grammars and strings of symbols?  To what extend would the 
<br />
logic of a system be dependent on the (human) artifacts known as the 
<br />
&quot;m-k-s&quot; system of measurements, ie, the real number line?   Can one 
<br />
assign a meter to a system logic?  (Robert Rosen argued against this 
<br />
possibility for biological systems.)
<br />
<p>The Platonic title to this series of posts, Re: opinions vs knowledge 
<br />
- The Cave is Constructed, motivates a cynical comment - one puts 
<br />
one's energy into the construction of a cave if one wishes to stay in 
<br />
the dark rather than become enlightened.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />

<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is really have some difficulty to understand how we can think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;logic&quot; is a (narrow) human invention!!!????
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We DISCOVER the world and the universe around us but we don't INVENT it. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discover slowly by slowly how the world &quot;works&quot;. We transform a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality and by interacting with it (mostly still in extremely &quot;unconscient&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way) we produce changes and we (RE) invent things. And so on.. This is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process of evolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To think that LOGIC has something to do with my individual understanding (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agreement) seems to be a kind of very radical anthropocentrism. Or however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we call it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the world is what it is, and if I don't agree with a lot of things (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact I don't agree with war, racism, crazy dubble yuu´s, etc...) it does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mean that there is NO LOGIC in the whole process!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I perceive something as a chaos, it doesn't mean that there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intrinsic logic in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Logic also doesn't mean determinism! This would be in fact a very narrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding of logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not sure, but I think Ted said: &quot;I wonder what the FIS agenda is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought to be by anyone who assumes logic is somehow embedded in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanics of the universe.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think that I understand correctly: first of all the universe is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at all &quot;mechanic&quot;.. the view of a mechanistic universe has been overcome at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least 100 years ago. Of course I think that there is an intrinsic logic in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the evolution of the universe, our solar system, our planet, and the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution (including ourselves) on it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or, maybe we should define clearly what every one of us understands by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;LOGIC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For me, a system has its intrinsic logic - if its regulations, laws and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interactions lead to pragmatic consequences, which are NOT deterministic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(!), but are &quot;free&quot; to happen in a frame of limited possibilities (given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly by the logic of the system).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And I think that this discussion makes sense when we try to understand and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define the concept of INFORMATION.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is an obvious relation between logic (how I am used to understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept) and structural Information of an open dissipative system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Norbert
