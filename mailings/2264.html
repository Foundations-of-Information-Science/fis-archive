                <p>
                    My reaction to Jerry's below:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;Jerry's system of thought appears to be similar to reductionism in
                    <br />
                    biology. Reductionism in biology is the view that what is most important /
                    <br />
                    fundamental is what is inside -- and then further inside again, looking
                    <br />
                    always for what something is made of. Biologists usually stop reducing
                    <br />
                    when they reach macromolecules, thereby holding to genetic reductionism.
                    <br />
                    Jerry apparently wishes to go further yet, into molecular species and
                    <br />
                    atomic kinds. This, I think, is the basic difference between he and I.
                    <br />
                    For me, reality is irreducibly multiscaled -- as in [ etc.[biome
                    <br />
                    [population [organism [cell [macromoleule [etc. ]]]]]], with no level being
                    <br />
                    more fundamental than any other. One consequence of this is that no gene
                    <br />
                    is possible without a cell, and that is not possible without some
                    <br />
                    macroscopic scaffolding (syncitium, organism, etc.), and that is not
                    <br />
                    possible without still higher level supporting systems. The reality is BOTH
                    <br />
                    bottom-up AND top-down. In this scenario, thermodynamics has pride of
                    <br />
                    place because the entire system depends upon energy usage to keep it going,
                    <br />
                    and it seems there is as well fairly good reason to think that the whole
                    <br />
                    structure has the particular forms it has as a result of maximizing overall
                    <br />
                    entropy production. (Note that this statement excludes the potential
                    <br />
                    entropy that might be derived by destroying the system as well. The entropy
                    <br />
                    production in question is that produeced BY the system upon external
                    <br />
                    available energies. )
                    <br />
                <p>Now, turning to Jerry's questions:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;JLRC Stan - the focus on Pattee's arguments about initial conditions in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;not particularly meaningful for bionetwork theory.� (If you have
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;counter-examples to this statement, I would be pleased to hear them.)
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: My statement is more the point that I do not see how bionetwork
                    <br />
                    theory (to the extent that I have been able to fathom its very abstract
                    <br />
                    conceptualizations) has any meaning for understanding biology.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;What does it mean to initialize a bionetwork?� Is any other initialization
                    <br />
                    outside of evolution possible?� (Sporulation is a special case that
                    <br />
                    requires a special discussion.)� �Such expressions as &quot;constructed initial
                    <br />
                    and boundary conditions&quot;, which are based in real numbers and
                    <br />
                    thermodynamics,�do not describe the conditions internal to a cell.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: So, is the cell not a material system? Its inside is no whit
                    <br />
                    different than the inside of a biome as far as my viewpoint is concerned.
                    <br />
                    There is nothing magical about it. If we can &quot;initialize&quot; a biome, then we
                    <br />
                    an initialize a cell. Or does Jerry suppose that even a biome cannot have
                    <br />
                    initial and boundary conditions? Actually initial conditions really are
                    <br />
                    artificial, and refer to experimental setups only. Boundary condition,
                    <br />
                    however, are natural constraints. If there is something, then it
                    <br />
                    necessarily exists someWHERE.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;�JLRC: Such properties are intrinsic to the concept of a bionetwork for a
                    <br />
                    living system. �In particular, Stan, given that the logic of proto numbers
                    <br />
                    is fundamentally different from the logic of the real numbers, I do not see
                    <br />
                    how these concepts are relevant� to�bionetworks. Perhaps you have some
                    <br />
                    ideas on how you might transform this hypothetical bio-logic into the logic
                    <br />
                    of the proto numbers?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I'm afraid I need a primer on &quot;proto-numbers&quot;. Below
                    they seem to
                    <br />
                    approximate integers, so I will continue on that premise. From that point
                    <br />
                    of view, I do not see any urgency to transforming &quot;bio-logic&quot; into integer
                    <br />
                    form. In my view integers, because they are crisp, are artificial human
                    <br />
                    constructions, with doubtful relevance to the actual world. And what is
                    <br />
                    bio-logic? For me biology's logic, like that of any material system, is:
                    <br />
                    build -&gt; burn -&gt; rebuild -&gt; etc. If I was to be (again) a little boy with
                    <br />
                    blocks, I would stack them up, knock them down, and so on. In doing this,
                    <br />
                    a biologist would see ATP -&gt; ADP -&gt; ATP, etc., etc.

                    discreteness. This discreteness of 'species of matter' is something that I
