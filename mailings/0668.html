<p>
I will take my second message this week to comment on some questions 
<br />
of Peter's. These are my own personal thoughts and should not color 
<br />
the ideas solicited in the previous message.
<br />
<p>Q1: Info from self-organization (structure)
<br />
<p>My own view is that the novelty of the FIS perspective comes from the 
<br />
desire to discover or create a mechanism where information drives 
<br />
toward structure. As we also worry about the &quot;multilevel problem,&quot; I 
<br />
believe that expands the desiderata to include structure creating 
<br />
information, which then in turn leads to structure at a new level.
<br />
<p>I believe that this new science (as are all) is synthetic and will be 
<br />
engineered from the abstractions we have at hand, with the 
<br />
capabilities desired, and cutting the world at natural joints. This 
<br />
is to say that info from structure is a _requirement_, rather than a 
<br />
discovered effect. A statement of the requirement is to support info 
<br />
at the cellular level drives organization at that level resulting in 
<br />
a system, say brains. Info in brains self-organizes (and as John C 
<br />
says, &quot;reorganizes&quot;) by an identical mechanics with some abstractions 
<br />
&quot;switched&quot; to use a linguistic notion.
<br />
<p>Q2: Decisionmaking and structure
<br />
<p>The term &quot;decision&quot; makes sense at higher levels. An open challenge 
<br />
is to understand the congruent commitment to structure where 
<br />
information moves from dynamic to static and creates structure at a 
<br />
lower, non-anthropomorphic layer. What constitutes this state 
<br />
transformation (&quot;situating&quot; information persistently) was understood 
<br />
by me (from Vienna) as the central, initial FIS challenge.
<br />
<p>In this view, one could see the frog catching the fly as an 
<br />
(automatic) &quot;decision&quot; of the frog or of the fly or of the frog's 
<br />
genes or of the pond's ecosystem. Or of some abstract world with no 
<br />
physical feature.
<br />
<p>Q3: A Need for new information paradigms
<br />
<p>The lazy answer is that we have a very strong, multi-issue statement 
<br />
of the problem, and some well-reasoned suspicions that existing 
<br />
paradigms cannot address it. The notion of deterministic decisions 
<br />
will go away and be replaced we hope with non-deterministic 
<br />
phenomenon at a lower level with apparent determinism at a higher 
<br />
level. This will require folding the native abstractions of lower 
<br />
levels (what elementary particles &quot;say&quot; to each other) with somewhat 
<br />
familiar &quot;value&quot; metrics at the business (and other societal system) 
<br />
level.
<br />
<p>Pedro's &quot;flavors&quot; and &quot;granularities&quot; though targeted by him at the 
<br />
biological level should pertain at all levels. These are matters of 
<br />
the abstraction mechanism, and it is not important to me what 
<br />
elements control these, only that some editions map to the convention 
<br />
of something1 sends, something2 is sent, and something3 receives. 
<br />
(Something2 can be ephemeral.) This soft requirement is only to be 
<br />
able to reliably call it a (parallel, alternate, replacement) science 
<br />
of information
<br />
<p>Q4: Information as software
<br />
<p>To me, the FIS novelty is that the &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot; are 
<br />
intrinsically linked, each defining the other (to the extent you wish 
<br />
to see them separately). The computer analogy is therefore not 
<br />
useful. But as noted above, there needs to be a something2 that 
<br />
exists as least temporarily outside of structure. (I suppose that the 
<br />
structure can be nonphysical.) The shaking of the notion of 
<br />
information as a software message (or message container or channel) 
<br />
is something that is necessary.
<br />
<p>Q5: Category theory
<br />
<p>I absolutely agree with Jerry's presumption of the importance of 
<br />
category theory as a suitable mathematical framework. The Q5 question 
<br />
is inaptly put, though. (It asks whether the use of CT requires the 
<br />
notion I above suggest we need to lose.) If the novel FIS agenda is 
<br />
pursued, CT will be applied to understand cross-domain (or level or 
<br />
ontology) views as Jerry suggests. This is a more aggressive move to 
<br />
understand and control abstractions than is commonly encountered and 
<br />
ineluctably takes us beyond the past to reinvent common concepts. 
<br />
This makes Q5 moot.
<br />
<p>I believe &quot;formalizability&quot; to be important. My definition is simply 
<br />
that there be a useful, pragmatically complete calculus that reveals 
<br />
the mechanics in some insightful and useful way. We need for the 
<br />
semantic space what Maxwells' equations (for example) are for their 
<br />
application. (Provably formal is another matter.)
<br />
<p>Q6: Formalizability of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;incident&quot; information
<br />
<p>I find this characterization useful, but I understand the 
<br />
&quot;constraints&quot; (and I suppose he includes other internal information) 
<br />
as &quot;situation,&quot; only because it makes it easier to use the situation 
<br />
theory that addresses this problem in this same way with Q5 formal 
<br />
rigor.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
<p>(Procedural request. When facilitators mention available papers, 
<br />
please, please give the URL.)
