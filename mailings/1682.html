<p>
Thank your for the very interesting discussion and questions.  Let me try to 
<br />
answer one of the questions:  What is the difference between the prediction 
<br />
of instances of the same kind (Whewell's test 2) and prediction of instances 
<br />
of a different kind (consilience a la Whewell)?
<br />
<p>It seems to me that there are at least two distinct goals of theory or model 
<br />
building in science.  One is to obtain a good picture or representation of 
<br />
the way the world works-the causes or mechanisms lying behind empirical 
<br />
phenomena.  This is what philosophers refer to as a realist goal.  Then 
<br />
there is the goal of making accurate predictions.  The goal of predictive 
<br />
accuracy is often referred to as an instrumentalist goal of science. 
<br />
Predictive accuracy is a truth-related goal (since accuracy depends on what's 
<br />
true), but it is limited to what's directly observable.  The realist goal 
<br />
goes beyond that.
<br />
<p>Reconsider the example in which we apply Kepler's laws (K) to the motion of 
<br />
the moon and Galileo's law of projectile motion (G) to explain terrestrial 
<br />
phenomena.  In each case, there is a parameter that can be estimated by 
<br />
fitting the laws to the data.  For celestial phenomena we can measure Kepler's 
<br />
constant, which is the period of motion squared divided by the mean radius 
<br />
cubed.   From the terrestrial phenomena, we can measure the constant g, 
<br />
which is the acceleration due to gravity.  Galileo thought that the 
<br />
influence of the earth's gravity did not reach the moon (for Galileo, the 
<br />
moon's circular motion was a kind of force-free inertial motion).  So, 
<br />
Galileo did not interpret Kepler's constant as a measure of the earth's 
<br />
gravitational influence.  Now, notice that Kepler's and Galileo's laws are 
<br />
adequate for predicting instances of the same kind.  That is, Kepler's laws 
<br />
prediction new observations of the moon's motion, and Galileo's laws predict 
<br />
new cases of terrestrial motions.  The mere conjunction of K and G passes 
<br />
all of the tests that fall under Whewell's test 2.  But it does not unify 
<br />
terrestrial and celestial motion in any way.  It does not achieve the 
<br />
consilience that is achieved by Newton's theory.  That consilience is 
<br />
achieved by the fact that Kepler's constant and g provide independent 
<br />
measurements of the earth's mass, where these measurements agree 
<br />
numerically.  That agreement does not contradict K or G.  K&amp;G accommodates 
<br />
this relational fact.  But it does not predict it.  So, maybe a clearer way 
<br />
of making Whewell's distinction would be to say that unified theories 
<br />
predict *relational* facts, and unified theories are confirmed (supported, 
<br />
verified, corroborated) when such relational facts turn out to be true.
<br />
<p>My intuition is that the observed consilience of Newton's theory gives us 
<br />
some reason to believe that gravity, as measured by the earth's 
<br />
gravitational mass, real does exist and the earth's gravity is influencing 
<br />
the moon's motion.  If this is right, then a (successful) consilience 
<br />
provides some evidence that Newton's theory is actually succeeding in 
<br />
capturing something deep about the underlying causes of motion.  This is 
<br />
evidence for a realist as opposed to an instrumentalist goal.
<br />
<p>Notice that consilience can be achieved even when the sub-models (such as K 
<br />
and G) are not very good at predicting instances of the same kind (just as 
<br />
Kepler's laws are not very good at predicting the moon's motion, because the 
<br />
fine details of the motion is fairly chaotic and unpredictable).   Maybe 
<br />
this is why oversimplified models (idealizations) have a useful role to play 
<br />
in science?   (Witness the fact that Kepler's laws are still widely used in 
<br />
astronomy.)
<br />
<p>If this is right, then it raises an important point about the methodology of 
<br />
science, which I think is widely misunderstood.  For example, Thomas Kuhn 
<br />
(in The Copernican Revolution) claims that Copernicus's appeal to the 
<br />
harmony of his theory nothing more than an appeal to an aesthetic virtue. 
<br />
Kuhn supports this view by pointing out that Copernicus's published model 
<br />
was less simple (had more circles) than Ptolemy's, and that Copernicus's 
<br />
theory was not more successful at making predictions.  All of this overlooks 
<br />
Copernicus's argument that his theory predicts relational facts that Ptolemy's 
<br />
theory does not.  In particular, Copernicus's heliocentric theory predicts 
<br />
that Mars will appear to move backwards (regress) if and only if the earth 
<br />
is overtaking Mars if and only if the sun is in opposition to Mars (relative 
<br />
to us).  Ptolemy's earth-centered theory accommodates this relational fact 
<br />
connecting the retrograde motion of Mars and the position of the sun, but 
<br />
does not predict it.
<br />
<p>It's no coincidence, in my view, that all subsequent theories, such as 
<br />
Kepler's, Newton's, and Einstein's, make the same prediction.
