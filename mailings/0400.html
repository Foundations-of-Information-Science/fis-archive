DEAR COLLEAGUES, AS A XMAS PRESENT HERE IS THE STORY HAPPENED IN TARAZONA...
<br />
<p>(Tarazona is an elegant medieval city, one hour drive from Zaragoza. One of
<br />
the characters of this story, archeologist &amp; historian Javier Bona to whom
<br />
I could talk about the FIS project, offers local help and some modest
<br />
financing for a &quot;real&quot; FIS venue in beautiful Tarazona, whenever we wish:
<br />
2003, 2004...)
<br />
<p>Merry Christmas to all.    ---Pedro

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescuing A Corner Of The Past
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter Ruby - Special To The Jewish Week (March 16, 2001)
<br />
<p>One day in the summer of 2000, an archivist in the magnificent medieval
<br />
cathedral of the northern Spanish town of Tarazona found that the cover of a
<br />
14th-century book in the church's collection of manuscripts had been ripped.
<br />
Examining the book closely, he discovered that inside the cover was an
<br />
until-then undetected document written in Hebrew that had apparently been
<br />
inserted into the cover hundreds of years ago to help hold the book
<br />
together. The Hebrew text was a synagogue document from Tarazona's long-lost
<br />
Jewish community, which like the rest of Spanish Jewry, was expelled from
<br />
the country in 1492.   Excited by the discovery, the archivist informed
<br />
Javier Bona, a local archaeologist who only months earlier had created an
<br />
organization known as The Association of the Friends of Jewish Culture-Moshe
<br />
De Portella, named for a Jew from Tarazona who was a legendary financier for
<br />
the King of Aragon during the 13th century. Spurred on by Bona, a team of
<br />
archivists peeled back the covers of a number of other venerable volumes
<br />
preserved in the cathedral, and found to their great excitement that these
<br />
books too had been held together by inserting inside their covers Jewish
<br />
documents which obviously had been confiscated by the local Catholic Church.
<br />
In the months since, the archivists have discovered some 60 of these
<br />
medieval Hebrew documents; an assortment of legal deeds and religious
<br />
writings, including one that is written in Arabic with Hebrew lettering.
<br />
These unique documents are proving invaluable to Bona and other members of
<br />
his association in fleshing out the life of the long-disappeared Jewish
<br />
community of the town.   Mention the glory of Spanish Jewry in the days
<br />
before the Inquisition and what comes immediately to mind are the southern
<br />
cities of Cordoba and Granada, where giants of Jewish history like Moses
<br />
Maimonides and Yehuda Halevi lived and wrote, and where highly literate
<br />
Jewish communities helped the Muslim leaders of Spain create a glorious
<br />
civilization at a time when Christian Europe was slumbering in the Dark
<br />
Ages. Another city where Jewish life flourished before the Inquisition is
<br />
Toledo, the beautiful former capital of Castille, located near Madrid in
<br />
central Spain, which, like Cordoba and Granada, is today much visited by
<br />
Jewish tourists from around the world.   But until now, there has been
<br />
almost no awareness in the Jewish world of the Judaic legacy of Tarazona and
<br />
other ancient towns in the northern kingdom of Aragon, whose King Ferdinand
<br />
married Castilian Queen Isabella and united their kingdoms to form modern
<br />
Spain.   That ignorance and neglect are expected to come to an end this
<br />
summer when Tarazona, a gemlike medieval town of 12,000 set on a verdant
<br />
plain below towering Mt. Moncayo about halfway between the Mediterranean and
<br />
the Atlantic, hosts a festival called &quot;The Return of Sepharad to Tarazona.
<br />
The festival, to be held on July 27-28, will be attended by the Israeli
<br />
ambassador to Spain, Aragonese and Spanish government officials and Jewish
<br />
dignitaries from around the world. The two-day event will feature an
<br />
exhibition of the recently discovered Hebrew manuscripts of the town at the
<br />
venerable palace of the bishop of the city; the presentation of a new book
<br />
on the history of Tarazona Jewry; a celebration of the cuisine of the Jews
<br />
of Spain and a concert featuring medieval Sephardic music.   (For more
<br />
information check the website, <a href="../../portella.pvirt.com/default.htm">http://portella.pvirt.com</a>.)   There will also
<br />
be walking tours of the Juderia (Jewish Quarter), an area of the old town
<br />
which has retained its name among the local population even though there
<br />
have been no Jews living there in 500 years. Expected to take part in the
<br />
festivities will be Israeli and Palestinian children who will attend a peace
<br />
camp in the town this summer under the auspices of the government of Aragon
<br />
and Encounter, an on-line community for Jewish-Arab reconciliation.   The
<br />
Jewish renaissance in Tarazona is likely to prove only the tip of the
<br />
iceberg in a coming revival of interest in and knowledge about the long
<br />
forgotten Jews of Aragon. According to Bona, &quot;Like Tarazona, virtually every
<br />
old city in Aragon has a Juderia, but until recently, no one seemed to care
<br />
who those Jews had been and what their lives had been like. We were
<br />
motivated to investigate the story of the Jews of Tarazona not simply out of
<br />
academic interest, but from a conviction that it is time to do justice,
<br />
however late, to Sepharad by recovering the memory of the Jews of Tarazona.
<br />
We must rescue a corner of the past for our common future.&quot;   Bona said
<br />
there is evidence of Jewish life in Tarazona and neighboring towns going
<br />
back to Roman times. He noted that the Jews of Tarazona had a close
<br />
relationship with the kings and queens of Aragon, going back to Moshe De
<br />
Portella in the 13th century, who was the equivalent of the Rothschilds in
<br />
his era. Around 1370, after Tarazona had nearly been destroyed in a ruinous
<br />
war between Castille and Aragon, the Jews of Tarazona financed the
<br />
rebuilding of the city's walls. When a massive pogrom against the Jews swept
<br />
across Spain in 1391, Tarazona was the only town in which the mayor issued
<br />
an edict - the text of which still can be found in the municipal archives -
<br />
promising stern punishment against anyone who committed violence against
<br />
Jews. The Jewish community of Tarazona remained intact until 1492, when
<br />
after the union of Castile and Aragon, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
<br />
decreed the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.   Visitors to the Juderia
<br />
today will find a rabbit's warren of narrow alleys and Spanish and Moorish
<br />
style buildings, most of them still lived in, which has changed little with
<br />
the passage of centuries. Several of the buildings, which are built on top
<br />
of natural rock formations, are known as the &quot;hanging houses.&quot; Below them
<br />
are caves, which also evidently served as rooms in the homes of residents of
<br />
the Jewish Quarter. In the past year, through use of old maps and documents
<br />
discovered in the Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace, Bona has managed to
<br />
figure out the function of many of these buildings during the 13th and 14th
<br />
century when the Juderia was at its height.   In the center of the quarter
<br />
is a large ruined dwelling that retains an ornate door from medieval times,
<br />
which apparently served as a Talmud Torah, which has clear evidence of a
<br />
mikveh in the basement. Bona said that the Association of the Friends of
<br />
Jewish Culture of Tarazona is now looking for the funding necessary to do a
<br />
full restoration of this house, in which it plans to place a museum devoted
<br />
to the life of the Jews of Tarazona. Nearby are buildings that have been
<br />
identified by Bona as a synagogue and a butcher shop.   The Juderia is a
<br />
three-minute walk from Tarazona's ornate city hall, which has a magnificent
<br />
frieze on its exterior depicting the coronation of Emperor Charles V of
<br />
Spain and Germany during the 16th century. The Cathedral and other venerable
<br />
buildings of Tarazona are built in the distinctive &quot;mudejar style,&quot; a
<br />
delicate lace-like form of brickwork which was created by Muslim master
<br />
artisans in Aragon and other provinces even after the re-conquest of those
<br />
areas by the Christians.   Another unique sight in the town is the only
<br />
inhabited bullring in the world, a creaky-looking circular structure that
<br />
today contains the apartments of families who hang their laundry from
<br />
balconies from which audiences cheer the matadors.   People in Tarazona seem
<br />
gratified that they are finally beginning the process of healing a
<br />
500-year-old wound by celebrating the Jewish heritage of the town. They are
<br />
also evidently excited by the possibility that they will soon see a surge of
<br />
Jewish visitors, which would give a needed economic boost to a town that
<br />
despite its beauty and antiquity, has hitherto been far from the beaten
<br />
tourist track. &quot;We look forward to welcoming home to Tarazona today the
<br />
descendants of the Jews forced to leave here in 1492,&quot; said the town's
<br />
mayor, Javier Calavia. &quot;That will be a kind of symbolic closing of the
<br />
circle, and will open us to the world in a way we have not been before.&quot;
<br />
Officials of the Aragonese government in the capital city of Zaragoza, an
<br />
hour's drive from Tarazona, point out that their own city of 700,000 also
<br />
has a rich history of harmony between Christians, Jews and Muslims and has
<br />
much tourist interest as well. Zaragoza's jewel in the crown is clearly the
<br />
Aljaferia, a sprawling castle and fortress built by the Muslim conquerers of
<br />
Zaragoza in the 10th century that later became the palace of the Christian
<br />
kings of Aragon. Today the castle houses the Cortes (Parliament) of Aragon.
<br />
Jose Maria Mur, president of the Cortes, said, &quot;We hope the Aljaferia will
<br />
serve as a place of encounter for the former Jewish and Muslim communities
<br />
of Aragon. Let them come home and reconnect to their Aragonese roots,&quot; Juan
<br />
Carlos Trillo, Aragon's ambassador to the central government in Madrid,
<br />
remarked. &quot;We are gratified that Aragon is finally coming to terms with the
<br />
terrible injustice of the expulsion of our Jews, which not only devastated
<br />
their lives, but did grievous damage to Aragon itself and the rest of
<br />
Spain.&quot;   Manuel Blasco, director of Zaragoza 2008, an effort by the city to
<br />
win the right to host the World Expo of 2008, noted that Zaragoza has
<br />
applied for a United Nations designation as a &quot;City of Peace.&quot;   &quot;Having
<br />
been the scene of religious persecution in the past,&quot; he said, &quot;we in Aragon
<br />
hope to build a brighter future by making a significant contribution to
<br />
peacemaking and conflict resolution in the years ahead.&quot;
