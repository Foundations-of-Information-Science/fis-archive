Jerry--
<br />
<p>Thanks very much for you comments. Judging by the responses, I managed to
<br />
take a very simple idea and make it needlessly difficult. While I had a
<br />
pleasant meal with William in Vienna, during which we discussed this
<br />
matter, I cannot presume to speak for him. But I can try to clarify my own
<br />
prior statement.
<br />
<p>I hope the list will forgive me for the poor etiquette of the copious
<br />
quoting...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;First, Prof. Dockens describes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The interfaces between psychology, anthropology, endocrinology, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pharmacology are crucial to a behavioral science approach to the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consiousness. Here, consciousness manifests itself from three perspectives:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) Inside, looking out,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) Outside, looking in and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3) Inside, looking in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Prof. Dockens perspective is close to my own views, but, not restricted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the nature of consciousness, but to causality in living systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus, one can classify causality as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: bottom-up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: top-down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: inside-outward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;: outside-inward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Such a classification allows for much more than layering; it allows for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a hierarchical logic of organization which includes scalar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships.  I think the bottom-up term is necessary to account for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;energy flows and for biochemical processes.  Such biochemical processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must underlie both pharmacolgy and endocrinology which are included in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;problems of consciousness.&quot;
</em><br />
<p>We've gotten off on the wrong foot. The key concept from &quot;behavioral
<br />
science&quot; that matters is autonomous organizing by some means. Causal
<br />
information (information that makes things happen) is-I think we all
<br />
agree-central to that. The metaphor of consciousness doesn't translate
<br />
directly because people (and groups of people) are conscious. Cells are
<br />
not, at least not in the same way. When formally dealt with, such
<br />
differences are normally considered in terms of abstraction. This provides
<br />
a reasonable way for talking about the nature of the information and its
<br />
communication at the level of atoms...
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;You'll recall that we supposed that there are two kinds of information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Info (1) which is the ordinary kind, but which I wish in the present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;context to limit to kinds of abstractions and messages that support (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;mechanics of) a science and Info(2) the impetus to organize. I submit that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;they are different and the challenge is to have them merge, which is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;likely possible in the social layer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The separation of info(1) and info(2) into these two descriptions is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit uncomfortable to a chemist.   Chemists believe that a fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature of atoms is that they attract to one-another in very specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ways (manners, accomodations, associations, co-ordinations, ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Molecules are organizations of atoms.  Biomacromolecules are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organizations of specific biomolecules.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Within chemical thermodynamics, the &quot;impetus to organize&quot; is described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in terms of energy relationships; these phenomena underly the need for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nutritional sustainance of living systems.  Of course, more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;imputus&quot; is needed to form new biological organizaions; the specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures must be obtained from the ecoment (surroundings) or from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;storage sources and reformed under the actions of the existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organization.  Thus, it would be most interesting to learn how the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notions of &quot;info(1)&quot; and &quot;info(2)&quot; can be made inclusive with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspectives of chemistry and with the notions of causality as expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ted Goranson further writes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;3. The laws which codify these new abstraction spaces (and ideally the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;mechanism which defines them) will be the most basic discoverable laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;This is to say that the mapping between info(1) and (2) will be not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;terms of information per se, but the definition of the abstraction spaces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;which define information. Since Category Theory is the mathematics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;abstraction, it may provide some useful formal techniques.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with the premise that abstraction spaces are necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represent complex systems.  A basic question is: Are two abstraction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spaces sufficient?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can we consider the term &quot;abstraction spaces&quot; to mean simply &quot;info(1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and info(2)&quot; or analogously, microscopically and macroscopically (as in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Boltzmann)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rosen argues, from a categorical perspective, that Newtonianism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insufficient.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Boltzmann's equation is closely related to a Newtionian perspective.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From my perspective, I have argued that category theory can be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;construct a hierarchy of &quot;abstraction spaces,&quot; but that these &quot;degrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of organization&quot; (in my terminology) are linked in a manner different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from (info(1) and info(2). Rather, it is argued that degrees of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organization are composed as a sequence of metalanguages within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;imputus to organize&quot; generated by chemical thermodynamics.  Thus, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of &quot;degrees of organization&quot; is open-ended; the logic of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;grammers must be defined in terms of observations of natural systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is asserted that within a cell (or any living organism), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;imputus&quot; to organize can be classified into the set of directional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causes given above; proof of this assertion will not be easy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Obviously, genetics play a role in the &quot;inside-outward&quot; causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am reluctant to comment on further aspects of Ted's post because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meanings of the wider assertions are unclear to me.  Perhaps Ted would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find the time to ground his assertions within an explicit context space?
</em><br />
<p>..So I proposed two ideas concerning abstraction.
<br />
<p>The first is quite simple actually. The way that humans reason about the
<br />
universe, say our understanding of how atoms organize into molecules,
<br />
involves a set of abstractions that are restricted by our mind's hardware
<br />
as well as the conceptual tools we have devised. I call that an abstraction
<br />
space, and it turns out to be one we know it rather well, because it is the
<br />
home for our own logic, science and language, as well as the simulcrums
<br />
we've built in silicon.
<br />
<p>But atoms, if they can be metaphorically said to reason, reason quite
<br />
differently than humans. With license, one can say it will be similarly
<br />
restricted to their hardware and the communicative means that has somehow
<br />
evolved at the atomic level. This is stretching the metaphor, but usefully
<br />
so. Whatever information is exchanged and which results from molecular
<br />
aggregation is native to the space of atom-thought (whatever that is). Now,
<br />
what attracts me about the FIS community is the belief that we can get a
<br />
handle on this world through considerations of information. My statement
<br />
was that the abstractions that constitute the information that involves
<br />
atoms and their societies is different than those which humans use. These
<br />
differences in nformation spaces will be understood as differences in
<br />
abstractions, and certain information mechanics will therefore differ. The
<br />
key in my mind is how these differ.
<br />
<p>The simple observation was that when people (abstract and) reason, they do
<br />
so about the real world. And when they create a science of molecular
<br />
binding, they do so in their (human) abstract space. We can say that this
<br />
is information (the human kind) about information (the intrinsic atomic
<br />
kind). And that we may be able to better understand the abstractions of the
<br />
information impetus for atomic aggregation by understanding that difference
<br />
and working backwards from our own human-colored abstraction space.
<br />
<p>The second observation is more speculative and dates (in my own mind) only
<br />
from the Vienna meeting. There would be not two information spaces, but
<br />
many. Information related to molecular binding will be inherently different
<br />
than that involved in cellular aggregation. I suggest that each will have
<br />
its own abstractions; its own domain of thought if you will. I proposed
<br />
that we can do even better than looking at two abstract spaces: human and
<br />
atomic-instead we can look at a sequence of layers with some primitive
<br />
information (read &quot;abstract&quot;) space at say quarks, then a molecular level,
<br />
then cellular, then animal, then societal-or whatever layering you wish.
<br />
The additional leverage this gives us is a set of boundaries between
<br />
abstract spaces. Information of some kind is passed among these spaces, say
<br />
from Conrad' neurons to his animal's mind. And the consideration of these
<br />
boundaries will help understand the nature of abstractions that define the
<br />
kind of information that drives the universe.
<br />
<p>Category theory is the basis we would use to reason well about such
<br />
abstraction spaces, and I have some developing ideas about this. My purpose
<br />
is backward from yours, Jerry. It turns out that we do not well understand
<br />
the abstractions of societal dynamics, so we have the so-called &quot;soft
<br />
sciences&quot; which are forced to use imperfect Bayesian abstractions,
<br />
numerical probabilities, the least powerful of abstract entities. So, if we
<br />
can understand these abstractions (of say molecular binding) and project
<br />
them to the top layer, we might have more robust tools to reason about
<br />
collaboration among people as well as atoms.
<br />
<p>We can take a shot at what types of abstraction atoms (or better for me,
<br />
elementary particles) exist in. Would you like to try that?
<br />
<p>The conversation about information and natural language discouraged me.
<br />
Natural language only illuminates the human abstraction space. The question
<br />
is: what is the &quot;natural language&quot; of atoms. Matsuno's contributions, in
<br />
this forum and others, has intrigued me. He focuses on the notion of tense,
<br />
and I believe this to be most cogent. It approaches the abstraction problem
<br />
through the causal component of language which is intuitively leverageable.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
