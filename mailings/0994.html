Dear Pedro and Sergei (sorry for this long mail!)
<br />
<p>I do not see very clearly which way(s) we should/could go further in this
<br />
discussion on music and... the genetic
<br />
code. Obviously we have a pre-understanding about what &quot;is&quot; music when we
<br />
deal with this question. Let me try
<br />
to put this pre-understanding as a question: when do we perceive something
<br />
(a sound) AS music? or, in more classical
<br />
terms: what is the &quot;essence&quot; of music? what does it a difference to
<br />
understand a sound as music instead of
<br />
'just' as a sound or as noise or...? Of course the answer to this question
<br />
depends on the horizon within which we
<br />
ask it. The genetic code may be such a horizon.
<br />
<p>As you know in Greek mythology  (Apollon/Orphic/Pythagoras)  this horizon
<br />
was the idea that music has a power
<br />
not only on human beings but also on animals,  plants as well as on the
<br />
whole of nature.
<br />
For Plato the 'techne mousiké' is a mathematical science (which included
<br />
poetry and dance as well as
<br />
reading and writing, the &quot;artes liberales&quot;). The idea that music can govern
<br />
over human, natural and divine forces
<br />
situates music as a metaphysic discipline related to cosmology and politics:
<br />
music as a therapeutic mean
<br />
in order to educate humans to be good citizens, for instance. Pythagoras
<br />
indeed was convinced that
<br />
there is a kind of universal/cosmic harmony. Music was a mean to take us
<br />
from the world of becoming into
<br />
the world of being also a Platonic thought, although Plato was less mythical
<br />
and more ethical in this regard).
<br />
<p>Aristotle (I follow very shortly the article &quot;Musik&quot; in the Historisches
<br />
Woerterbuch der Philosophie, Vol. 6), was
<br />
more modern as he separates music from movement (dance) and language
<br />
(poetry), but he thinks music
<br />
within an ethic horizon i.e. within the horizon of &quot;practical philosophy&quot;,
<br />
contrary to Pythagoras: music
<br />
intends to &quot;produce&quot; (poiesis) something which is related to 'ethical
<br />
character' and has a 'cathartic'
<br />
(or &quot;cleaning&quot;) effect on the soul. Similarly thinks Aristoxenos of Tarent
<br />
who conceives music more
<br />
as an ethic and less as a pure mathematic activity. This is also the
<br />
conception of cynic, skeptic and epicureic
<br />
schools (as different from new pyhagoreic and new platonic schools.
<br />
<p>I make now a big leap into modernity (18th century) when music was conceived
<br />
as an  aesthetic phenomenon and
<br />
as an 'imitation' (mimesis) of (ideal) nature or of the absolute in the
<br />
conception of the Romantic: music opens a completely different
<br />
world (as the world of the senses), it is an expression of human freedom
<br />
etc.
<br />
In the 20th century (Ch. von Ehrenfels, N. Hartmann, Ingarden)  music is
<br />
seen within the horizon of Gestalt
<br />
and time (Husserl) as a separte phenomenon, something critized by Marxist
<br />
schools: Lukacs) but again re-thought
<br />
by Bloch and Adorno (following Hegel).
<br />
<p>One way to structure our discussion would be to think music not only as a
<br />
cosmological or a biological
<br />
than as an 'ethical' discipline and from this perspective to reflect on its
<br />
connections for instance to
<br />
genetics. In this case we operate with an anthropological concept of music
<br />
that we may analogical
<br />
apply to other living beings, but not originally, i.e. we operate with music
<br />
in a narrow sense. Of course
<br />
we can broader this meaning (following the mathematic-pythagoreic-platonic)
<br />
tradition and think of music
<br />
as a correspondece (in time) of forms or &quot;Gestalt&quot; and thus look at the
<br />
anthropological level &quot;from the
<br />
bottom&quot; and more specifically from the genetic perspective which is probably
<br />
what Pedro is suggesting,
<br />
while Sergei would probably like to broaden this basis.
<br />
<p>cheers
<br />
<p>Rafael
