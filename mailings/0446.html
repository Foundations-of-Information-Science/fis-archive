<p>Chemical Coup D'Etat:
<br />
The US Wants to Depose the Diplomat Who Could Take Away Its Pretext for War
<br />
With Iraq
<br />
<p>by George Monbiot
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
On Sunday, the US government will launch an international coup. It has been
<br />
planned for a month. It will be executed quietly, and most of us won't know
<br />
what is happening until it's too late. It is seeking to overthrow 60 years
<br />
of multilateralism in favor of a global regime built on force.
<br />
<p>The coup begins with its attempt, in five days' time, to unseat the man in
<br />
charge of ridding the world of chemical weapons. If it succeeds, this will
<br />
be the first time that the head of a multilateral agency will have been
<br />
deposed in this manner. Every other international body will then become
<br />
vulnerable to attack. The coup will also shut down the peaceful options for
<br />
dealing with the chemical weapons Iraq may possess, helping to ensure that
<br />
war then becomes the only means of destroying the m.
<br />
<p>The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) enforces
<br />
the chemical weapons convention. It inspects labs and factories and
<br />
arsenals and oversees the destruction of the weapons they contain. Its
<br />
director-general is a workaholic Brazilian diplomat called Jose Bustani. He
<br />
has, arguably, done more in the past five  ears to promote world peace than
<br />
anyone else on earth. His inspectors have overseen the destruction of 2
<br />
million chemical weapons and two-thirds of the world's chemical weapon
<br />
facilities. He has so successfully cajoled reluctant nations that the
<br />
number of signatories to the convention has risen from 87 to 145 in the
<br />
past five years: the fastest growth rate of any multilateral body in recent
<br />
times.
<br />
<p>In May 2000, as a tribute to his extraordinary record, Bustani was
<br />
re-elected unanimously by the member states for a second five-year term,
<br />
even though he had yet to complete his first one. Last year Colin Powell
<br />
wrote to him to thank him for his &quot;very impressive&quot; work. But now
<br />
everything has changed. The man celebrated for his achievements has been
<br />
denounced as an enemy of the people.
<br />
<p>In January, with no prior warning or explanation, the US state department
<br />
asked the Brazilian government to recall him, on the grounds that it did
<br />
not like his &quot;management style&quot;. This request directly contravenes the
<br />
chemical weapons convention, which states &quot;the director-general ... shall
<br />
not seek or receive instructions from any government&quot;. Brazil refused. In
<br />
March the US government accused Bustani of &quot;financial mismanagement&quot;,
<br />
&quot;demoralization&quot; of his staff, &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;ill-considered initiatives&quot;. It
<br />
warned that if he wanted to avoid damage to his reputation, he must resign.
<br />
<p>Again, the US was trampling the convention, which insists that member
<br />
states shall &quot;not seek to influence&quot; the staff. He refused to go. March 19
<br />
the US proposed a vote of no confidence in Bustani. It lost. So it then did
<br />
something unprecedented in the history of
<br />
&nbsp;multi lateral diplomacy. It called a &quot;special session&quot; of the member
<br />
states to oust him. The session begins on Sunday. And this time the US is
<br />
likely to get what it wants.
<br />
<p>Since losing the vote last month, the United States, which is supposed to
<br />
be the organization's biggest donor, has been twisting the arms of weaker
<br />
nations, refusing to pay its dues unless they support it, with the result
<br />
that the OPCW could go under. Last week Bustani told me, &quot;the Europeans are
<br />
so afraid that the US will abandon the convention that they are prepared to
<br />
sacrifice my post to keep it on board&quot;. His last hope is that the United
<br />
Kingdom, whose record of support for the organization has so far been
<br />
exemplary, will make a stand. The meeting on Sunday will present Tony
<br />
Blair's government with one of the clearest choices it has yet faced
<br />
between multilateralism and the &quot;special relationship&quot;.
<br />
<p>The US has not sought to substantiate the charges it has made against
<br />
Bustani. The OPCW is certainly suffering from a financial crisis, but that
<br />
is largely because the US unilaterally capped its budget and then failed to
<br />
pay what it owed. The organization's accounts have just been audited and
<br />
found to be perfectly sound. Staff morale is higher than any organization
<br />
as underfunded as the OPCW could reasonably expect. Bustani's real crimes
<br />
are contained in the last two charges, of &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;ill-considered
<br />
initiatives&quot;.
<br />
<p>The charge of bias arises precisely because the OPCW is not biased. It has
<br />
sought to examine facilities in the United States with the same rigor with
<br />
which it examines facilities anywhere else. But, just like Iraq, the US has
<br />
refused to accept weapons inspectors from countries it regards as hostile
<br />
to its interests, and has told those who have been allowed in which parts
<br />
of a site they may and may not inspect. It has also passed special
<br />
legislation permitting the president to block unannounced inspections, and
<br />
banning inspectors from removing samples of its chemicals.
<br />
<p>&quot;Ill-considered initiatives&quot; is code for the attempts Bustani has made, in
<br />
line with his mandate, to persuade Saddam Hussein to sign the chemical
<br />
weapons convention. If Iraq agrees, it will then be subject to the same
<br />
inspections - both routine and unannounced - as any other member state
<br />
(with the exception, of course, of the United States). Bustani has so far
<br />
been unsuccessful, but only because, he believes, he has not yet received
<br />
the backing of the UN security council, with the result that Saddam knows
<br />
he would have little to gain from signing.
<br />
<p>Bustani has suggested that if the security council were to support the
<br />
OPCW's bid to persuade Iraq to sign, this would provide the US with an
<br />
alternative to war. It is hard to see why Saddam Hussein would accept
<br />
weapons inspectors from Unmovic - the organization backed by the security
<br />
council - after its predecessor, UNSCOM, was found to be stuffed with spies
<br />
planted by the US government. It is much easier to see why he might accept
<br />
inspectors from an organization which has remained scrupulously
<br />
even-handed. Indeed, when UNSCOM was thrown
<br />
out of Iraq in 1998, the OPCW was allowed in to complete the destruction of
<br />
the weapons it had found. Bustani has to go because he has proposed the
<br />
solution to a problem the US does not want solved.
<br />
<p>&quot;What the Americans are doing,&quot; Bustani says, &quot;is a coup d'etat. They are
<br />
using brute force to amend the convention and unseat the director-general.&quot;
<br />
As the chemical weapons convention has no provisions permitting these
<br />
measures, the US is simply ripping up the rules. If it wins, then the OPCW,
<br />
like UNSCOM, will be fatally compromised. Success for the United States on
<br />
Sunday would threaten the independence of every multilateral body.
<br />
<p>This is, then, one of those rare occasions on which our government could
<br />
make a massive difference to the way the world is run. It could choose to
<br />
support its closest ally, wrecking multilateralism and shutting down the
<br />
alternatives to war. Or it could defy the United States in defense of world
<br />
peace and international law. It will take that principled stand only if we,
<br />
the people from whom it draws its power, make so much noise that it must
<br />
listen. We have five days in which to stop the US from bullying its way to
<br />
war.
