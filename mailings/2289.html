                    Loet (and the list),
                    <br />
                <p>Actually, I have no problem with your description below, depending on
                    <br />
                    the meaning of 'emergent'. In my original complaint I was objecting
                    <br />
                    to the idea that sociality alone is sufficient to produce new
                    <br />
                    information (or new information capacity). The issue is similar to
                    <br />
                    that of whether or not neural nets can produce anything new
                    <br />
                    (substitute social nets to get the argument for the social case
                    <br />
                    mutatis mutandis). Jerry Fodor argues that they cannot, since space
                    <br />
                    of possibilities is not increased by anything that happens in the
                    <br />
                    net. Fodor is famous for his 'language of thought' hypothesis,
                    <br />
                    according to which there are no new ideas: all are innate. His
                    <br />
                    argument was designed to show that connectionism, as it is commonly
                    <br />
                    understood, cannot evade his argument for innateness. In the social
                    <br />
                    case, without further argument for a strong form of social emergence,
                    <br />
                    all meaning would be similarly innate, by a Fodorian argument to the
                    <br />
                    effect that all the possibilities must be inherent in the original
                    <br />
                    capacities of the underlying system.

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What I was trying to lead Loet to was the requirement of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear John and colleagues,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I understood the argument which you made in Behavioral and Brain Sciences
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;27(5), 2004, 629-630, but I did not understand why this would preclude the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility of another circulation process--generating probabilistic
                        entropy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;in another dimension--at the level of the emergent system.
                    </em><br />
                <p>That level being emergent in some strong sense is crucial. Otherwise there
                    <br />
                    is no 'other dimension'. All the dimensionality is in the original phase space.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The argument was about whether meaning could circulate at the level of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;social system in addition to and possibly in interaction with the
                        processing
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of information (uncertainty in the distributions) in this system. Note
                        that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the communication of meaning is not observable, but one can entertain the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis that meaning is communicated in social and psychological
                        systems
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Husserl). For example, a statement can be expected to contain information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and to be provided with meaning both by individuals and in discourses. The
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;two (analytically distinguished) communication processes mutually inform
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;each other. This mutual information would be equal to the meaningful
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;information which is selected from the circulation of the uncertainty.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Of course, there are philosophers who argue that all meaning is social
                    <br />
                    (e.g., Wittgenstein). I am inclined to agree with this myself, so without
                    <br />
                    sociality, I would say, there is no meaning. So I was restricting myself
                    <br />
                    to the dimensionality part of your argument.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I correctly remember your point was that this emerging system of meaning
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;circulation would not contain information, but it seems to me that this
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;depends on the operationalization. For example, in the economy one might
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;argue that the circulation of goods is valued (and in this sense provided
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;with meaning) by the circulation of prices. The circulation of goods and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;prices can be measured independently. When more than two levels can thus
                        be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;distinguished, mutual information in three dimensions can even be
                        negative.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus, the next-order system may locally reduce the uncertainty.
                    </em><br />
                <p>No, at least my argument was intended to address only the dimensionality
                    <br />
                    issue. If I did not make that clear, my apologies. I am afraid I do
                    <br />
                    not understand
                    <br />
                    your reference to negative information above. I do understand the idea of
                    <br />
                    mistakes that need correction, and of practical inconsistencies, and that it
                    <br />
                    can require effort to correct these, but I am not clear how either would imply
                    <br />
                    negative information. Entropy, in general is the complement of information
                    <br />
                    within a clearly defined statistical system, but maximum entropy is just
                    <br />
                    zero internal information. I would take it that mistakes and formal
                    <br />
                    inconsistencies are forms of entropy, and hence &quot;neginformation&quot;, to
                    <br />
                    use an ugly analogy to the word 'negentropy'. The effort of correction
                    <br />
                    is required to overcome this entropy (reverse it).
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps, I still miss out what I seem to have blocked. :-) Thus, the above
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;provide sufficient material for the further illumination?
                    </em><br />
                <p>I hope this helps to explain better what I meant, Loet. I was not saying
                    <br />
                    specifically that you were wrong, but questioning what would make you
                    <br />
                    right, since, as I said, sociality alone is not enough to get new dimensions
                    <br />
                    under typical treatments of phase spaces.
