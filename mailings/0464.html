Dear Colleagues,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I would like to add some words to this discussion track. The approach of
<br />
Karl Javorszki seems very promising in understanding what is information.
<br />
&quot;One specific arrangement of relations among numbers among many possible
<br />
arrangements of relations among numbers&quot; - this is really an important
<br />
point. In this context we can consider a description of the potential field
<br />
(let say it can be realized as a set of complex/ imaginary numbers as in the
<br />
Schroedinger equation) that is reduced (in the latter example - squared)
<br />
during actualization. The reduction is implied by the measuring device and
<br />
it cannot be predicted from the potential state, but it is implied as some
<br />
interaction between the device and the potential field. The concrete
<br />
structure of the device determines the extraction of a way for certain
<br />
reduction of the potential field, thus we can say it has some information
<br />
content. To what point this way leads? - that is the question. It leads to
<br />
some final state which perfection depends on the dynamic context.
<br />
Information is a message determining a way of realization of certain final
<br />
state. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Another point - the final state relates to the context but it may have some
<br />
objective properties. These properties are canons of perfection, limits of
<br />
realization of the measurement process. The simplest case - generation of
<br />
the golden section value via memorization of states in reflection loop
<br />
(described in my paper). It may need more thorough mathematical description
<br />
and analysis, and then it could be possible to construct a link between the
<br />
dynamics and morphology. Morphology is described by numbers, but it is not
<br />
static - it is a limit of recursion during actualization from the potential
<br />
field. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Information implies that final cause exists and it gives a way for reaching
<br />
it. It may be correct or wrong, but this is estimated from the point of view
<br />
of the final result. Fitness (in Darwinian sense) is not an absolute
<br />
paradigm for this, canons of perfection will include fitness as a case. So
<br />
we need incorporate the final cause to understand what is information.
<br />
D.M.Dubois in BioSystems 43 (1997) 97-114 suggested that it is possible to
<br />
compute not only from the time past and present but also from the time
<br />
future. This will not be a classical determinism, it will be really a
<br />
generation of messages about ways to perfect final states and they will
<br />
really possess information. Determinism from the past really bears no
<br />
information at all: information appears when the past/present state is
<br />
included with possible future state in a whole picture which validity is
<br />
established during the way (and finally after the way is completed). The
<br />
previous state includes some &quot;hidden harmony&quot; (in Heraclitean words), which
<br />
becomes actualized, but this hidden harmony &quot;is better&quot;, it includes
<br />
different potential realizations, some of them could be better than what is
<br />
potentially actualized. The &quot;hidden harmony&quot; is that I call the &quot;internal
<br />
quantum state&quot; - it is coherently maintained via error-correction, and the
<br />
living system exists until it is maintained.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I agree with Koichiro, there should be an interpretation of quantum
<br />
mechanics that susbstantiates these long-living states and turns from
<br />
uncertainties to consistent paths, and actually the apparatus of quantum
<br />
mechanics allows developing this approach. The point is: information has no
<br />
validity in classical deterministic picture, it has validity within the
<br />
freedom of choice, but the value of choice is determined by its estimation
<br />
from the (future) state which will be reached (as it was predicted, or with
<br />
some modifications, or will not be reached at all).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Returning to the initial point, indeed the numbers are dynamic if they have
<br />
sense, i.e. information. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Best regards,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
