<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Incidentally, this was what I was trying to lead Loet to a while back

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when I argued that no new information arises from sociality alone. This

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is just one of many difficult cases. Many physicists will say (as they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to me) that the phase space of the system is a given, and thus all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the information in the system is given in advance by that structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of that phase space, so new information is impossible. I say that if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have dissipation of the same order as that of a central property of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system (especially its cohesion, or dynamical individuating property --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see, e.g. Collier and Hooker, &#x201c;Complexly Organised Dynamical Systems&#x201d;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Open Systems and Information Dynamics , 6 (1999): 241-302), then new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information can appear, in the sense that a) it cannot be computed from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the original system, as long as its properties are localized, and b)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing can control the system to select one attractor over another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(unless it uses high power and substantially changes the phase space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I was trying to lead Loet to was the requirement of additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditions on mere sociality, but he cleverly blocked my attempt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illuminate him.
</em><br />
<p>I would like to support John's view here.
<br />
<p>Suppose we have two heterogeneous systems with the same numbers of the same
<br />
kinds of molecular constituents.
<br />
<p>System A is purely physical/chemical.  The states of the system pass on
<br />
endlessly to new configurations, each one is historically unique but in the
<br />
long run the system is ergodic.  It is not very far from the most likely
<br />
configuration of thermodynamic equilibrium.
<br />
<p>System B has further levels of organization (say, both 'biological' and
<br />
'social').  But we are reductionists, and we seek to observe only the
<br />
chemical level constituents at any time.  We will find that these low level
<br />
configurations in System B are selected from possibilities that might arise
<br />
in System A.  There is no new information here -- except INFORMATION
<br />
itself.  That is, System A (except for the heterogeneity itself) is one of
<br />
pure informational entropy, while system B has had constraints put on
<br />
possible configurations -- by the emergent biological and social level
<br />
constraints.
<br />
<p>History has worked in System B too, but so has selection and preservation
<br />
of (using a Peircean term) 'habits' (= information).  So there is no
<br />
statistical difference in these systems at the phys-chem level, except that
<br />
state transitions have been drastically slowed down (generating friction)
<br />
in System B.  The generation of new historical states (and of entropy! --
<br />
which is produced as well during the higher level arrangings) has been
<br />
partially moved upscale, to the higher levels in System B.  But at the
<br />
molecular level, we find no states not observable in System A, merely
<br />
strange associations of such states and lags in their replacements.
<br />
<p>How might the transition from System A to System B be generated?  By
<br />
accelerated expansion of the overall system (as in the Big Bang).  In the
<br />
Universe this has increased the force pulling matter together, so that
<br />
bigger and bigger configurations (or configurational constraints) become
<br />
possible.
<br />
<p>Is it possible that some phsical-chemical configurations might be reached
<br />
during imposition of the higher level constraints that could not be
<br />
possible in System A?  I don't think it is possible to know the answer to
<br />
this.  If not, then the only new thing to have emerged has been stability
<br />
of states, which, again = information.
