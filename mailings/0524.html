In reply to Soren,
<br />
<p>Soren Brier said:  &quot;in Fuschl  we greed on accepting &quot;levels of
<br />
existence&quot; in some kind of heterachy (inspired by Len Troncale), where
<br />
it made sense to distinguish between physical causality, informational
<br />
causality and semiotic causality&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina: I don't understand this 'heterarchy' of causes and how they
<br />
operate within levels of existence. The four Aristotelian causes
<br />
(material, formal, efficient and final) are much clearer and operate
<br />
within ALL levels of existence. Surely the Fuschl group didn't
<br />
conclude that the different realms of existence (physico-chemical,
<br />
biological and socioconceptual, as I see them) operate within isolate
<br />
causes, so - I find the above statement confusing. Again- I don't know
<br />
what 'semiotic causality' is. I've never heard of it. Same with
<br />
'informational causality'.
<br />
<p>Soren Brier said: &quot;Now Peirce sets Aristotle's ontology into
<br />
evolutionary motion. Peirce is not only a hyle-morphist but also
<br />
hylozoist. Matter is alive inside (with the pure feeling of
<br />
Firstness).Thus the world is bound together, not by an ideal potential
<br />
pattern as in Aristotle, but by a continuum (plenum) with pure
<br />
feeling's spontaneity and the law of minds tendency to take habits and
<br />
become effete. Matter is effete mind says Peirce&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina:  Actually - Aristotle doesn't use an 'ideal potential
<br />
pattern'. That's Plato and Aristotle is quite opposed. Aristotl'e
<br />
potentiality is dynamic and is evolutionary, operating within a basic
<br />
'infinite motion', and moving along 'with' final cause...which is a
<br />
communal pragmatic cause.
<br />
And with Peirce, the world is bound together, as Soren says, by that
<br />
pure feeling (Firstness) as constrained within Mind  or Thirdness (not
<br />
human mind but universal mind) and become particular within
<br />
Secondness.
<br />
<p>Soren Brier said: &quot;Thus Edwina is right that everything exists in
<br />
relations, but I do not find it useful to call all relations semiotic.
<br />
In the living we are working with more than ten different kinds of
<br />
semiosis or semiotic levels (see the last figure in my paper).
<br />
<p>Edwina: Well- I guess we'll have to disagree. I call all relations
<br />
semiotic and there are not ten different kinds of semiosis - but there
<br />
are ten basic semiosic signs, as outlined by Peirce.
<br />
<p>Soren: I would prefer - also for historical reasons and not to make
<br />
the new vision too strange for the scientists - when talking about
<br />
nature to accept an entangled form of causality on the quantum level,
<br />
a physical-energetic causality on the physical-chemical level (as
<br />
described in physics as exchange of energy), an informational-signal
<br />
organizational causality in dissipative structures and the like and
<br />
then a semiotic causality in living systems and finally a
<br />
linguistic-communicative causality in human conscious and social
<br />
systems. I agree with Rafael  that the information concepts spins of
<br />
from this our communicative relation.
<br />
<p>Edwina: But- all systems are energy-exchange and therefore
<br />
'dissipative'. Again - I have no idea what a 'semiotic causality'
<br />
means. I've never heard the term.
<br />
<p>Soren: &quot;Peirce's world view is interactive, so you are right (maybe
<br />
with Maturana and Varela) that to a certain degree (with constraints
<br />
of secondness and thirdness) &quot;we bring forth a world&quot; when we perceive
<br />
and interpret it. It is fairly strait forward in social relations, but
<br />
it has to go all the way down to inanimate nature but only to a very
<br />
minor degree. We cannot give up the objective resistance of forces and
<br />
willpower that is Secondness and the regularity and stability coming
<br />
form Thirdness, (making Maya exists!),. Although we may all be one in
<br />
the firstness of the pure feeling of mind at the deepest level of
<br />
existence the world  is still there.
<br />
<p>Edwina:  Actually, I'm not a follower of Maturana and Varela. I don't
<br />
feel comfortable with closure and self organized systems. I prefer
<br />
complex adaptive systems..and everything in our universe fits into
<br />
those processes. ..so, I don't agree with 'only a minor degree'.
<br />
However, our relations with the world are not subjective phenomena.
<br />
Our relations have to express pragmatic validity. No matter how much I
<br />
might wish I could fly off the 8th floor of my condo building - I
<br />
think I'd be surprised if I tried. As for Secondness and Thirdness -
<br />
why and how could they be given up? The three categories are
<br />
operational at all realms of existence...and I'm not into holism or
<br />
oneness.
<br />
<p>I too have overstepped the 'two posts a week' limit.
<br />

<br />
