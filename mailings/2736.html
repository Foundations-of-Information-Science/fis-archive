                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ted, can you give us an example from the social realm for your statement
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;My understanding is that when those information abstractions (which
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolve with the system) become overloaded, a new level of the system is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;created, with new, &quot;cleaner&quot; abstractions.&quot;
                    </em><br />
                <p>Igor-
                    <br />
                <p>This is a tough one.
                    <br />
                <p>The reason is because of the old inside-outside problem. Each higher level
                    <br />
                    develops two properties: its abstractions are the residue of complexity
                    <br />
                    breaking in lower levels, plus the higher levels can &quot;see&quot; the lower ones
                    <br />
                    from the outside. (As we can see and understand chemical dynamics.)
                    <br />
                <p>In this, I am imputing that there is a hierarchy of consciousness, so for
                    <br />
                    example biological entities have some introspective qualities over physical
                    <br />
                    ones, just as we as humans do over both biological and physical. A
                    <br />
                    corollary is that introspective awareness does not flow up. This is another
                    <br />
                    way of saying that the information primitives of a higher level would be
                    <br />
                    incomprehensible to those of a lower. We would not expect molecules to
                    <br />
                    understand human love, for instance.
                    <br />
                <p>In this scheme, humans could understand the abstractions in an information
                    <br />
                    dialog of lower ones, which is what we call science. And perhaps soon we
                    <br />
                    may recast scientific theories in terms of these information abstractions.
                    <br />
                    Incidentally, this is what I take as the agenda of FIS.
                    <br />
                <p>But we cannot of levels higher than us. So if there are higher levels of
                    <br />
                    emergent structure beyond social systems - entirely possible and likely -
                    <br />
                    we couldn't understand it. I believe this is why the notion of a God or
                    <br />
                    gods is so persistent.
                    <br />
                <p>Note in this, that a higher level of organization with its own emergent
                    <br />
                    laws is a quite different thing (the way I am talking here) than just &quot;more
                    <br />
                    structure.&quot; So international peace, Gaia, or Stonier's internet-based
                    <br />
                    &quot;global brain&quot; are all within our current, social layer.
                    <br />
                <p>So I cannot give you an example. But I think we can say some things about
                    <br />
                    it if we can suss out the steps associated with complexity breaking at
                    <br />
                    lower levels and extrapolate. I believe this higher level would have some
                    <br />
                    evolved, soft logic like situation theory, which is why I bang on that so
                    <br />
                    much here.
                    <br />
                <p>And I believe that the foundations of set theory will weaken at that higher
                    <br />
                    level and category theoretic axiomatic systems be stronger. I also strongly
                    <br />
                    believe in the transcendence of symmetry across layers, that the notion is
                    <br />
                    some sort of information super-primitive.
                    <br />
                <p>Beyond that I cannot say. But we are working on it. I do believe that we
                    <br />
                    can build artificial systems that can &quot;see&quot; this level where we cannot.
                    <br />
                    This my current job.
                    <br />
                <p>Hope this helps.
                    <br />
                <p>Best, Ted
