<p>
Communication through language is perhaps the main characteristic of 
<br />
the dynamics of human society as it is the feature that makes 
<br />
possible the gradual integration of the INFORMATION as knowledge 
<br />
accumulated needed by humans for making better any decision
<br />
<p>This general knowledge empirically, heuristically or scientifically 
<br />
integrated for any community (local, regional, national or 
<br />
international) as cultural, economic, social, political,&#x160; information 
<br />
is indeed indispensable for learning to push ahead the evolvement of 
<br />
causal interactions among people and organizations in order to 
<br />
improve their living and their dynamic properties respectively.
<br />
<p>Most humans individually keep trying to participate in the evolvement 
<br />
of every societal organization through ideas transferred by means of 
<br />
spoken and /or written language. These ideas being engendred by the 
<br />
intended comprehension and assimilation of idealized cultural values 
<br />
under the influence of feelings, emotions, susceptibilities, 
<br />
sentiments, passions,&#x160; that emerge in every brain after being 
<br />
perceived and interpreted, always peculiarly the surrounding reality.
<br />
<p>So far so good, if it were prudent and sensible to idealize the 
<br />
behavior of the humans that will be involved in each case in order to 
<br />
create a reliable framework as needed for impulsing the development 
<br />
of well chosen causal interactions.
<br />
<p>The trajectory determined by humans for the whole civilizing 
<br />
adventure shows evidently that at the dawn of one conventional third 
<br />
millennium IT IS NOT ADVISABLE, therefore IT IS NOT FEASIBLE to 
<br />
believe that the performance of humans nowadays could be idealized 
<br />
for creating a humane perspective for humankind neither for 
<br />
increasing the survival chances of Homo sapiens sapiens. It seems 
<br />
convenient to examine some arguments about it.
<br />
<p>Very often all along the last millennia some knowledge has caused the 
<br />
degeneration of many terrestrial circumstances due to the narrow 
<br />
minded and shortsighted decision makers' interests and motivations 
<br />
which were -and still are - conceived, designed, structured and 
<br />
implemented under the influence and even pressure of the unilateral 
<br />
ambition and the selfish, egoistic and greedy thoughts that arise in 
<br />
brains exclusively oriented by the desire of increasing the power and 
<br />
the domain of certain individuals and their vassals, accomplices and 
<br />
partners.
<br />
<p>Evidently it has been the communication among human specimens, who 
<br />
have learnt to perform inhumanely what has caused the controversial 
<br />
manifestation of the whole civilizing trajectory, which has been 
<br />
until today essentially determined by all kinds of sanguinary actions 
<br />
supported by pseudo-cultural values that were invented for justifying 
<br />
these actions and organized with the support of informationthat was 
<br />
invented and propagated for such a purpose
<br />
<p>Many other animals are also able to generate ideas and to organize 
<br />
their individual performance in sccordance with their thinking, but 
<br />
cannot communicate any idea to the other living beings located in 
<br />
their surrroundings because they lack words. Therefore they only 
<br />
manage from time to time to influence other animals at a distance and 
<br />
occasionally to affect the behavior of some of them through peculiar 
<br />
signs such as the movement of the limbs, the attitudes if the body, 
<br />
the expression of the face,&#x160; Consequently none of the other animals 
<br />
have sttitudes against the species they belong to.
<br />
<p>Animals will never organize a war against their congeners
<br />
<p>Humans instead are even encouraged by means of communication of ideas 
<br />
to be increasingly motivated till becoming deeply interested in 
<br />
learning to behave more and more inhumanely in front of humans and 
<br />
also animals
