&nbsp;Dear Loet,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I have been following this one and others extremely interesting discussion
<br />
threads since I joined the FIS-list. But your latest comment on Jerry's
<br />
thoughts provoked me to respond directly as I see something that looks like
<br />
a potential danger (would it be a commonly accepted truth) to the science.
<br />
What prompted me is your last sentence: &quot;my answer would be negative because
<br />
this would restore a kind of wholeness that I consider as religiously
<br />
motivated.&quot; Sure, I understand that this is your attitude and everybody is
<br />
free to have own opinion therefore it is not you whom I want to address this
<br />
message, but the very idea of avoiding any &quot;possibly being religiously
<br />
motivated&quot; developments in science. What makes me think that it hides a
<br />
danger are numerous examples from a post-Soviet space where this very
<br />
motivation indeed was a compulsory rule of the ideology and policies of the
<br />
science of those not-so old days. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As a result the Big-bang theory in Russia and neighbouring countries has
<br />
been considered to be fake for an incredibly  long period. The same was with
<br />
the entire sciences of cybernetics, genetics and all relating theories.  The
<br />
only answer to &quot;why&quot; was - all these theories and sciences are capitalistic
<br />
and religiously motivated and therefore are not conformal with
<br />
scientific-materialistic worldview... As you understand this situation
<br />
virtually killed any developments in these sciences and related theories in
<br />
the former Soviet space for several decades. Although nor Big-bang theory
<br />
neither sciences of cybernetics or genetics were religiously motivated... 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In fact I find Jerry's ideas very important as scientists from different
<br />
fields still miss the holistic point in worldview and sometimes, I would say
<br />
&nbsp;naively expect that properties of atoms or cells that constitute systems of
<br />
higher hierarchies do not influence emerging new properties in those systems
<br />
&nbsp;Thence we have &quot;strange unexplored Territories&quot; or mismatches between
<br />
theories of some sciences. Although it has been used to be widely accepted
<br />
for already several decades among close branches of sciences that natural
<br />
systems explored are somehow similar: physicists and chemists used to say
<br />
that nuclear reactions in principle are similar to chemical ones, ecologists
<br />
(e.g. Odum) state that response to stress in ecosystems is in principle
<br />
similar to the response of an individual, etc... I think these similarities
<br />
are indeed very interesting points to be deeper investigated using
<br />
intellectual tools of the science of cybernetics and related branches.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Seasons greetings !
<br />
With best regards
<br />

Subject: [Fis] (no subject)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Dear Jerry, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thank you for these interesting quotations from Whitehead.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Apologies for the following misunderstanding:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am puzzled on how one would fit chemical philosophy into such a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical philosophy. Chemistry philosophy is grounded on ratio's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of small whole numbers and neither nuclei or electrons can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distributed into &quot;1/2 + 1/2&quot;. Loet's post suggests that we need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look carefully at how the marketing of information is tied to simple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical operation of addition.
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The example of 50/50 was just chosen to explain how information theory is
<br />
grounded in probability theory. The addition is generated because by
<br />
definition the sum of the probabilities is equal to unity. Additionally, the
<br />
Shannon formulas are so elegant because they are based on simple summations
<br />
(to the maximum of the maximum entropy of a system under study).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In chemical systems the distributions are more complex than 50/50. However a
<br />
distribution can always be expected to contain an information. This
<br />
description of the system is different from the chemical one. It generates
<br />
an information-theoretical model of the system. The system under study is
<br />
specified in terms of its operation: what is communicated when the system
<br />
communicates? What is redistributed? This remains epistemologically the
<br />
specification of an expectation.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Observations can be generated by specifying &quot;how&quot; the system is expected to
<br />
operate. One can then ask whether this operation can also be indicated. The
<br />
specification of an indicator may lead to the measurement. Thus, this is not
<br />
a philosophy of mathematics or a philosophy of chemistry, but the
<br />
specification of a cybernetics program. The measurements improve and update
<br />
our expectations. In principle, a third question can be to ask for the &quot;why&quot;
<br />
of what one observes using the indicators thus specified. This leads to
<br />
substantive theorizing in the subject domain under study. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Each subject domain can thus be developed into a special theory of
<br />
communication. This accords with your nice quotations from Whitehead. The
<br />
mathematical theory of communication provides us with the formal methodology
<br />
&nbsp;Of course, one can also use other statistics. The advantages of using the
<br />
mathematical theory of communication, however, are manifold. For example,
<br />
one can elegantly combine the multi-variate perspective (complexity) with
<br />
the time series perspective in order to develop the instruments of measuring
<br />
complex dynamics.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thus, my contribution is not to be misunderstood as a philosophical one. The
<br />
philosophical question would be whether one expects a general theory of
<br />
communication to be possible. My answer would be negative because this would
<br />
restore a kind of wholeness that I consider as religiously motivated.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards,
