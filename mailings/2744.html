                    Yes, politicians steer on the institutional constraints of the
                    <br />
                    self-organizing system. The center of control is dynamic and potentially
                    <br />
                    responsive to the steering. Thus, the steering of a complex and adaptive
                    <br />
                    system mainly generates &quot;unintended consequences&quot;.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    The function of politics, therefore, has changed. It is mainly propelling
                    <br />
                    itself as a political discourse which disturbs other subsystems of society,
                    <br />
                    both in terms of setting conditions and as legitimation. For example,
                    <br />
                    politicians try to be on television in order to legitimate their functions.
                    <br />
                    The political system can only gain in steering power by being more reflexive
                    <br />
                    about its functions.

                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Dear colleagues
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    I have the impression that there is an agreement about the existence of
                    <br />
                    biological and sociocultural constraints that impact on our ability to
                    <br />
                    understand and manage socioeconomic complexity. These constraints are
                    <br />
                    organized hierarchically, as Stan puts it, {biological {sociocultural }}.
                    <br />
                    As far as I can tell, social science is not much interested to explore the
                    <br />
                    constraints below the biological, and if we take the perspective of
                    <br />
                    evolutionary psychology, than the psychological level may be subsumed in the
                    <br />
                    biological.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Perhaps we could address socioeconomic complexity from the minimum of three
                    <br />
                    different perspectives: behavioral, informational or semiotic and material
                    <br />
                    (the latter refereeing to the artifacts and material substances that we pile
                    <br />
                    up in our environment and which impact we cannot fully understand nor
                    <br />
                    control; e.g. products of nanotechnology; toxic chemicals, weaponry).
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    One behavioral and informational aspect of socioeconomic complexity can be
                    <br />
                    identified in unintended consequences of political actions aimed to design
                    <br />
                    an institutional framework in order to achieve certain social or economic
                    <br />
                    purpose. Consider a simple example of the liberalization of electric energy
                    <br />
                    market in the US, UK and more generally in the EU. The aim of policy makers
                    <br />
                    was to unbundle the vertically integrated companies (power generation,
                    <br />
                    transmission, distribution and supply) in order to create a competitive
                    <br />
                    environment which would ensure investments in new capacity and in energy
                    <br />
                    efficiency, and at the same time drive down the prices of electrical energy
                    <br />
                    to the consumers and industry. What happened after nearly twd decades of
                    <br />
                    liberalization (apart the California energy crisis in 2000/01) is that
                    <br />
                    prices were fluctuating quite unpredictably, originally deintegrated firms
                    <br />
                    (like in England and Wells) started to vertically integrate while
                    <br />
                    cross-border mergers and acquisitions created bigger and more powerful
                    <br />
                    energy companies than before (market concentration was one of the thing that
                    <br />
                    lineralization wanted to change). According to some authors none of the
                    <br />
                    original aims (price reductions, energy-efficiency, new investments) was
                    <br />
                    fulfilled.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Now, the point for me is not that an unintended consequence did happen but
                    <br />
                    the fact that policy makers in the EU are continuing to push institutional
                    <br />
                    reforms in spite of the fact that it does not seem to work the way they want
                    <br />
                    it. As long as we do not postulate that there is a hidden agenda behind
                    <br />
                    their stated goals, then either the decision makers are not rational
                    <br />
                    (beacasue they push the agenda with full awareness that it will not work) or
                    <br />
                    they do not understand the processes and the constraints they hope to
                    <br />
                    affect. The latter may be the sign of the (social) system inability to
                    <br />
                    achieve certain goals in a complex sociocultural environment. This would not
                    <br />
                    be surprising: the signs that come from the energy market are not fully
                    <br />
                    consistent and thus allow for different interpretations; there are several
                    <br />
                    competing theories that may be used to explain the market dynamics and make
                    <br />
                    predictions; interpretations may be biased by different ideologies and
                    <br />
                    worldviews.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    The liberalization of the energy market is a complexifying process: from the
                    <br />
                    monopolistic, and state regulated to the competitive, and profit driven
                    <br />
                    industry. In this process institutional constraints are continuously added:
                    <br />
                    markets are composite institutions themselves and to these the policy makers
                    <br />
                    add numerous new rules to achieve their specific goals. The aim to
                    <br />
                    streamline the energy sector by using markets with additional institutional
                    <br />
                    constraints may exceed our capability to handle the process and forsee the
                    <br />
                    consequences. To some extent, it may be a sign of diminishing returns to
                    <br />
                    complexity in problem solving that Joe addressed in his book &quot;The collapse
                    <br />
                    of complex societies&quot;.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    If we cannot manage the energy sector to serve certain social and economic
                    <br />
                    goals, how can we hope to be able to manage more complex situations like the
                    <br />
                    climate change, poverty reduction and population growth in the South?
                    <br />
                    Did we reach the limits (cognitive and cultural) to manage our complex
                    <br />
                    world?
                    <br />
                    (I guess I put another crazy question again...)
