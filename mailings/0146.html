<p>
ON THE NATURE OF SOCIAL INFORMATION
<br />
<p><p>If information is the measure of reduced uncertainty an observer has about
<br />
the world, then social information is the measure of a society*s reduced
<br />
uncertainty.  I know several of you will be uncomfortable with that because
<br />
you are convinced that only humans can be observers.  But I think
<br />
observation is simply interaction, and interaction can take place between
<br />
every kind of element and system, provided there is an energy gradient
<br />
available.  There is a record or trace left of an interaction, however,
<br />
only when some structure can be noticeably changed as a result of a flow
<br />
across a frontier.  The record of an interaction, which provides a kind of
<br />
*map* of the observed, is the alterations in internal components and
<br />
relationships defining the observing structure.  When the structures
<br />
associated with information are living systems, if not exclusively human
<br />
beings, neural networks or similar brain-related tissues are altered.
<br />
These material media store memories about encounters between organisms and
<br />
their worlds.
<br />
<p>Societies also store memories, but not always in material media.  There are
<br />
material records, of course, in the forms of tools, art works, and
<br />
documents.  But societies also store information in rituals and rites,
<br />
social roles and institutions, languages and myths.  Recording interactions
<br />
with the world in, e.g., social roles means that it is changed human
<br />
behaviors which store social information.  Of course, humans can change
<br />
their behaviors individually, spontaneously, and for their own private
<br />
reasons.  But if we imagine spontaneously changing individuals in
<br />
isolation, then it is clear the record of these changes can be stored in
<br />
their separate brains and bodies.  However, if these individuals are
<br />
members of societies, then their behavioral variations may affect how*and
<br />
even whether*others live.  The records of these actions will then be stored
<br />
in external systems, like symbol systems and organized group behaviors.
<br />
The recording media change because it is information about the groups, not
<br />
the individuals in them, which now to has be stored.
<br />
<p>The existence of these records indicates that information about social
<br />
collectives is qualitatively different from the biological information
<br />
stored in genes and tissues.  Collectives are not always easy to perceive,
<br />
especially if you are burdened with an Anglo-American sensibility.  But it
<br />
takes only a moment to appreciate how societies could self-organize, on the
<br />
one hand, and have effects on the world and their components which
<br />
permanently transform both.  If that is so, then the structure of a
<br />
self-organized society is itself the embodiment of social information, for
<br />
the social structure remembers, through replicated rituals and rites, roles
<br />
and institutions, languages and myths, how much the group*s uncertainty
<br />
about a transformed environment was reduced.
<br />
<p>Societies self-organize when the number of human interactions pass a
<br />
threshold and, suddenly, become interconnected wholes greater than the sum
<br />
of their parts.  This is not mystical, for if synergies between people
<br />
release energy into an environment which has effects disproportional to its
<br />
causes, feedback from the environment *selects* the whole.  Although
<br />
generated bottom-up by interacting people, once organized societies have
<br />
top-down effects on their constituents.  The whole sustains itself by
<br />
recording what it, the society, knows about the world.  That cannot be done
<br />
in the brains and bodies of people, for then we would have lots of
<br />
information about yous and mes but no information about the us shared in
<br />
common.  The most obvious example is the invention of agriculture, which
<br />
released energies able to sustain an exploding population that was trapped,
<br />
ever after, in the Iron Cage of its own making.  For an expanded population
<br />
could not survive by following its biological injunctions*it survived by
<br />
sustaining the agricultural system.
<br />
<p>For agricultural systems to survive it was necessary to communicate
<br />
messages to all of their members describing how they must restrict the
<br />
number of possible behaviors available to them biologically*fight, flight,
<br />
mate, sleep, eat, etc*in favor of a circumscribed set of behaviors.  The
<br />
latter is essential because it is only by practicing selected behaviors
<br />
that the social network on which all depend is reconstituted.  Only if
<br />
people counted on to dig ditches, say, did so regardless of how tired they
<br />
were or of how little return they got on their labor could those who
<br />
ploughed fields expect to have the water needed to ripen crops, which
<br />
soldiers, scribes, and artisans needed to perform the tasks on which ditch
<br />
diggers depended.
<br />
<p>It is important to realize that there is nothing in our biology that
<br />
requires digging ditches, say, and little in the outcomes of early
<br />
civilizations to seduce people into such endless labor. People performed
<br />
these jobs because their societies obliged or forced them to, which is why
<br />
Spencer called early forms of correlated human behaviors *coercive
<br />
cooperation.* Being restricted to a narrow set of externally determined
<br />
behaviors by the whole to which a person belongs is playing a *social
<br />
role.*  Social roles record what societies know about collective
<br />
environments.
<br />
<p>People learn how to play social roles as members of societies, by
<br />
assimilating the information stored in their structures.  Social roles are
<br />
communicated to people, in the first instance, by reenactments of
<br />
successful collective enterprises, typically dances or games, which, over
<br />
time, become rituals and rites.  Once the behaviors appropriate to a social
<br />
role become clear, however, they could be institutionalized by blows and
<br />
shouts.  Blows and shouts are not subtle means of communicating but they
<br />
can be effective, especially if people could be locked into particular
<br />
behaviors and, thereafter, simply required to repeat them.  Simple social
<br />
systems self-organized in stable and benign environments survived by
<br />
confining people to rigidly prescribed behaviors for long periods of time.
<br />
<p><p>But if individuals varied their behavior they sometime found more effective
<br />
ways to exploit nature, and the increased flow of resources would have
<br />
required more specialized roles and more intimate relations to process.
<br />
(Environmental changes can have similar effects, of course.) Processing
<br />
increased flows by telling generations upon generations to perform the same
<br />
tasks would no longer be adequate, for there would be new tasks to perform
<br />
and many different ways to perform them.  Thus, more, and more complex,
<br />
messages would have to be sent.  People might have to be taught to alter
<br />
their social roles or at least to vary some of their outputs as
<br />
circumstances changed.  Sending more messages and more complex ones
<br />
required developing new media for communicating.  Rather than telling
<br />
people exactly what to do, societies needed to equip them with the ability
<br />
to figure out not only what role to play but which variant of the role
<br />
applied, how intensely to apply it, etc.  Then people could guide
<br />
themselves*and still sustain the interacting network on which all depended.
<br />
To communicate information about complex actions, repeating messages was
<br />
not enough.  New forms of redundancy were required.
<br />
<p>For people to guide themselves they needed to anticipate how the collective
<br />
environment would respond to structural alterations in a society caused by
<br />
varied individual behaviors.  Anticipations require the use of mental
<br />
models, which in this case would be views of the social wholes to which
<br />
individuals belonged.  Typically, it is an axiom of systems theory that
<br />
while wholes can observe parts, parts cannot observe wholes.  So providing
<br />
a god*s-eye view was not easy.  But when Values, Ethics, and Morals (VEMs)
<br />
emerged a device was at hand.  VEMs symbolically represented morally
<br />
significant end-states and provided rules for arriving at*or avoiding*them.
<br />
Pursuing those states according to the prescribed rules leads individuals
<br />
to judge their own actions and make meaningful choices between options.
<br />
VEMs are symbolic representations of the roles members of societies play,
<br />
which roles themselves are behavioral representations of the worlds
<br />
societies create.
<br />
<p>Maps of the behaviors that map the world, VEMs are quintessential social
<br />
information.  Because they are not records of personal experiences, which
<br />
can be communicated in terms of sensations of pleasure and pain, VEMs are
<br />
new kinds of information.  The knowledge of good and evil, VEMs symbolize
<br />
what actions *mean* and then harness sensations of pleasure and pain in the
<br />
pursuit of socially beneficial behaviors.  VEMs only emerge after the phase
<br />
change from nomadic scavengers to sedantic farmers takes place, after a
<br />
context in which individual actions have collective effects self-organizes.
<br />
The context, of course, is the social whole, and actions which tend to
<br />
sustain it are *good* while those tending to destabilize it are *bad.*
<br />
<p>VEMs make the evolution of more complex societies possible because they
<br />
contextualize messages.  Messages which contextualize information are much
<br />
more dependable, for they give receivers clues on how to decode them and
<br />
thus increase the probabilities that the sender*s intention will be
<br />
achieved.   When communication systems improve, social systems can access
<br />
many more states, process different kinds of flows, and make more efficient
<br />
use of resources.  But securing messages depends on providing individual
<br />
decision makers with the ability to, imaginatively, rise above their
<br />
station and view the social whole.  Thus, VEMs are metaphorical periscopes
<br />
recording the reduced uncertainty societies have about their
<br />
environments*which uncertainty VEMs keep to a minimum by constraining
<br />
human behaviors.  This kind of information also helps people reduce their
<br />
uncertainty about each other and themselves.
<br />
<p>VEMs demonstrate that social information exists, is a measure of reduced
<br />
uncertainty, and has no agency.  Social information should not be reified
<br />
and does not DO anything.  But it does record the emergence of new
<br />
observers*social systems rather than biological, chemical, or physical
<br />
ones...
