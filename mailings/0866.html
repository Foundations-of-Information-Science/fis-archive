Dear Ted --and colleagues
<br />
<p>Below I am trying to answer your metadiscussion points. It would be quite 
<br />
interesting hearing responses from other parties too.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a great list. Perhaps the discussion on the necessity of sign 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should also be included. What you have listed are where the discussion has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indicated non-convergence, but I suspect that the actual nubs behind the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differing opinions can be discovered and exposed --the different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;religious issues&quot; if you will.
</em><br />
<p>Yes, I agree that the sign problem has to be included. Just for personal 
<br />
parsimony, I prefer making sense on cellular communication first ('language 
<br />
of cells'--metabolic origins of cellular semantics), and then comparing the 
<br />
obtained insights with the very strong schools of thought on human symbolic 
<br />
capabilities... About our personal motifs, maybe we have to 'imagine' these 
<br />
actual nubs, and organize cooperation in spite of them (or just thanks to 
<br />
them).
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have found the virtual conference very much more useful than, say, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical one in Vienna because the virtual intercourse has exposed some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;first principles&quot; to have more utility than I had previously allowed. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;e-conference is a self-organizing system in itself, with interaction of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstractions for recognition and dominance. For instance, I previously saw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;investigations of &quot;signing systems&quot; in emergent chemical behavior as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dead end. I preferred the abstractions humans use to deal with molecules 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather than working seriously with the abstractions that molecules 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves use. I'm now convinced otherwise -- not sure I have the tools 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to make something of this insight, but to do so a research team would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to choose among the various philosophies espoused here.
</em><br />
<p>Yes, I quite agree. The hundreds of messages exchanged during these eight 
<br />
months represent quite a lot for laying down coherent foundations of the 
<br />
science --more than we did either in Madrid or in Vienna. But well, it 
<br />
means just three days against 8 months. Still, I think we need the 
<br />
intensity and livelihood of a real conference. I got local support in that 
<br />
beautiful city of Tarazona (close by the big Moncayo mountain) for a fis 
<br />
event, but we would need further sponsors to finance some portions of 
<br />
travels and stay... Is there any FISer who could offer some financing, or 
<br />
just offer the organization in a different city? Suggestions will be very 
<br />
welcome.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;An example is the category theory issue versus set theory as the basis for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the abstraction. It seems you MUST prefer one, and the question is of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which strikes very deep into the issue of whether meaning or effect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follows or bears any relationship at all to recognition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro, your job is to be polite and inclusive, so you tend to skirt these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;issues. But isn't there value in digging deeper and at least trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clarify the basic differences in approach? It might help our self-organization.
</em><br />
<p>As far as I see, we have possibilities to organize a new 'conceptual 
<br />
itinerary', a very exciting one, including more or less that list of 
<br />
unsolved themes. Making a consistent whole body of doctrine, dealing with 
<br />
the info, entropy, recognition, abduction, and adaptability theories from 
<br />
molecule to organism, looks impossible; but it is feasible to prepare an 
<br />
optimized conceptual itinerary making new bridges in strategic points. The 
<br />
result, I think, is a brave new view on living matter, plus the serious 
<br />
possibility that the most sensible part of that view could work for further 
<br />
existentialities based also on info games &amp; adaptability within 'abstract' 
<br />
sociosystems.
<br />
<p>In short, the cell highlights the firm --although it may perfectly run the 
<br />
other way around: the firm highlights the cell... As far as I know there is 
<br />
a current crisis in knowledge management (entrepreneurially oriented) and 
<br />
knowledge engineering. It means a real opportunity for us, in either 
<br />
direction we choose to contemplate the info relationship. And who knows 
<br />
whether brains, the 'mental engines', would get a very parsimonious view in 
<br />
this conceptual itinerary too --a very strategic item for our contemporary 
<br />
'info society' problems.
<br />
<p>Stating my theoretical ignorance, I prefer set theory, expressed through 
<br />
partitions (à la Karl). The problem is that I have a very deep disagreement 
<br />
in the way Karl advances his biological ideas. I have told him long ago to 
<br />
explore other directions in his extremely interesting conceptual system, 
<br />
but maybe I have offered him scarce practical cooperation in order to do 
<br />
that. In particular I think that his interrelation between sequences and 
<br />
mixtures needs an in-depth revision (well, I accept that I can be wrong, 
<br />
but at the time being I do not think so). In protein science there is a 
<br />
very curious historical anecdote about a similar situation of deep mixing 
<br />
of ideas... better in a next message, as this gets too long. Anyhow, these 
<br />
rather abstruse theoretical matters necessarily have to be discussed 
<br />
face-to-face. So the importance of a real conference right now (around next 
<br />
year!).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we were putting together a research lab for this work, we¼d need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make some basic decisions (quite independently of personalities) about:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--the mix of disciplines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--some application domain in which the science can be tested (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;presumably be useful), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--some essential leverageable principles, including some commitments as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;noted above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I take your notion of a soccer team to address the first bullet more than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the third.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As to the second, I believe your preference for the application domain is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in social and economic systems which will then provide a new &quot;economics&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for molecular organization. This is the other way around from many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represented here.
</em><br />
<p>Assembling a fis research project --if there is anyone brave enough to 
<br />
create the institutional logistics-- would be a dream. As Karl and John 
<br />
have put it, THE GREAT EXPECTATION.
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
