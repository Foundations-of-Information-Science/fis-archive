<p>
For the record, Pedro, replying here to Aleks, confuses which hierarchy
<br />
Aleks is referring to.  This is quite commonly done -- so much so that I
<br />
think it worthwhile to give some pointers.
<br />
Aleks is here using the scale hierarchy: [Biggest scale [intermediate
<br />
[smallest scale]]], interpreted as  [higher level [lower level]].  These
<br />
refer to wholes and parts.
<br />
Pedro is using (what I call) the specification hierarchy: {most general
<br />
{more specific {most particular}}}, interpreted as {lower level {higher
<br />
level}}.  These are sets and subsets.
<br />
(Both hierarchies branch from left to right.)
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aleks' statement
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one avoids the recursive self-referential loop (What is A to A? What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feeling of feeling cold? What is the meaning of meaning?)
</em><br />
works only in the scale hierarchy, where each level has a completely
<br />
different lexicon, as in [cell descriptors [molecular descriptors
<br />
[fundamental particle descriptors]]], and where the dynamics at the
<br />
different levels differ by at least order of magnitude.
<br />
<p>STAN
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aleks:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was merely trying to concoct a physicalist theory of meaning in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of Stan's hierarchies: the higher level is the 'meaning' of the lower
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level, and the lower level is the 'fact' to a higher level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The description of the set in terms of its subsets will always have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arbitrary touch in it, if there are several &quot;layers&quot; of subsets. Specifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so, if the segmentation of the set into subsets happens several times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concurrently. Given some properties of a subset, its included subsets have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also some predictable properties. The properties of subsets of a subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depend heavily on the properties of the mother subset.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aleks:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This way one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; avoids the recursive self-referential loop (What is A to A? What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feeling of feeling cold? What is the meaning of meaning?),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are two languages which describe a set: one details the proportions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subsets among each other, the other details the properties of individuals.
</em><br />

<br />
Replying to Viktoras:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       Thank you Stan for the comments, they provoked some more comments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from my point of view focusing more to the other side of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;coin&quot; though...  
</em><br />
<p>SS: &gt;Entropy production finds its meaning in Universal disequilibrium, the
<br />
result of accelerated expansion of the Universe, while self-organization
<br />
finds its meaning only locally in the drive for self-realization.  
<br />
V: isn't the Universe a self-organizing &quot;global system&quot; sustaining its
<br />
internals (with us amidst all the scales and levels of systems) intact by
<br />
means of expansion &quot;in order&quot; to minimise heating effects of Entropy
<br />
production. It cools down to keep us alive and expansion of the Universe is
<br />
a sign of it's &quot;sustainability&quot; and &quot;global long-range correlations&quot;. This
<br />
is local position from global system's (Universe's) point of view.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS:  I am using 'global' to refer not only to the 'whole thing', but
<br />
also to any intensive property.  'Local', then, is a portion, as well as
<br />
any extensive properties. I agree that the accelerated expansion of the
<br />
whole Universe is the source, and support, for all material objects,
<br />
including self-organizing systems.  Furthermore, self-organization and
<br />
growth are also afforded by the accelerated expansion.  Without that
<br />
expansion they could not occur.  The resulting disequilibrium globally then
<br />
calls for entropy production locally, and this is realized as a tax on
<br />
work, including the work of self-organization.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Self-organization plays also a global role here.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, we know so little about the Universe as a self-organizing
<br />
system, I tend to see it thermodynamically rather as the context of local
<br />
self-organizations.  I don't disagree in principle, but I find that the
<br />
Universe is more useful in my thinking as a thermodynamically global
<br />
system.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we look at the history, then we also see that economies that survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;longest periods of time and expand are not the most aggressive ones.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I don't think I implied that the hottest economies were the
<br />
longest lasting.  They are the ones that subvert and destroy their
<br />
neighboring ones, and ultmately themselves.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The most aggressive empires with their bulky &quot;world domination&quot; plans -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all are dead.  Interestingly some of them were destroyed from inside - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subsystems enforced to serve to an empire one bright day refused to do so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So survivors are the most relatively sustainable ones - where culture,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge plays a major role, and not weaponry and number of divisions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What was the Soviet Union 50 years ago and where is it now ? What about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maya, Inka, Roman Empire, Hitler, Stalin, Alexander, Chingiz Chan?  All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they were too &quot;hot&quot;- so they burned themselves from inside, either were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exterminated by a supersystem.  At certain levels of produced entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system can no longer sustain its internal structure, and self-destruction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starts.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Yes.  That is why living systems in general are successful.
<br />
Because of the filter of reproduction, they maximize work rate (and
<br />
therefore entropy production) only to the degree necessary to outcompete
<br />
their neighbors (those that overdo this fail to reproduce adequately).  In
<br />
order to get the most energy, to heal injuries as fast as possible, and to
<br />
outreproduce their neighbors, they maximize the dissipation of external
<br />
energy sources -- to a limit that stops short of burning themselves.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So whats is left - those whose internal Entropy production levels are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lower - i.e. where heat due to an entropy production is higher than T1 but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lower than T2. Natural selection and limited heat-resistance of bonds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among system parts rules out all that are lower than T1 and higher then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;T2.  Its like &quot;entropic niche&quot; of a system. So it does not look like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy maximisation, rather it is an optimization task.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I take it as maximization because of the necessary competition
<br />
with others.  Those who dissipate a gradient fastest get most of it. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we think about apoptosis and destruction of non-sustainable cancerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cells - there are some parallels with examples from above economies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeed.  By the way, number of wars decreases... Sweden for example hasn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;had major wars for some 200 years (it did not participate in WW2) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably is among the most sustainable and the most developed countries in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Europe. It is probably most educated too. It is a nice example where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absence of wars plays a major role in evolution of sustainable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prospering economy, science and technology as well as high prices and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most possibly highest taxes.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, I wonder to what degree Sweden has lasted so well because it
<br />
has been implicitly supported by some of the hot systems (in the 'West').
<br />
The Soviet Union would undoubtedy have taken it if that were not opposed by
<br />
the hottest economy in the world.  But, I agree that our goal for
<br />
'sustainability' should be to get away from the Global Capitalist System,
<br />
and to drop the nonsense about the necessity for 'economic growth'.
<br />
<p>_______________
<br />
Replying to Bob -
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BU: My take is that the creation of entropy is &quot;accidental&quot; to all real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; processes, not always causative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     SS: Thus Bob eschews final causality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stan, I most assuredly do not eschew final cause. Rather, I wish to posit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;final cause in the domain of some agency. I don't see agency per-se in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;action of the second law. The second law is what happens in the absence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agency.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Then you are not willing to generalize agency, which is what I do,
<br />
as in {physical agency {biological agency {human agency}}}.  Or, {teleomaty
<br />
{teleonomy {teleology}}}.  My point of view is that any attribute can be
<br />
generalized.  And, if you need a distinct agent, the Universe is a distinct
<br />
entity in cosmology discourse.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;BU: In particular, I see in autocatalysis a &quot;self-entailing&quot; aspect that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;not derivative of any associated gradient in energy (or exergy, to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;more exact.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     SS: So autocatalysis can occur without any energy input?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Certainly, autocatalysis doesn't occur in the absence of energy input, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the input doesn't drive the autocatalysis in the same determinate way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is common among non-living systems.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This sounds perilously like you are thinking that biological
<br />
systems can transcend their physical ground!  Autocatalytic systems merely
<br />
have contraints added to the ones working in all physical systems.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To be more specific, autonomous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems engendered by one energy gradient are capable of switching to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other gradients. We see that all the time in ecology and economics. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;final cause is not to be found in the energy gradient, but rather in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;centripetal&quot; behavior that is a hallmark of autocatalytic behavior (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;life) itself.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Two points:  (1) I don't find final cause in energy gradients, but
<br />
in the need for Universal equilibration. (2) I don't deny finality to the
<br />
autocatalytic system. The setup is {entropy production {autocatalysis}}.
<br />
The latter is particular way to accomplish the former, which contextualizes
<br />
it.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;BU: There is an opposing tendency, attributable mostly to the action of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;autocatalysis (and the partial autonomy thereof) that acts in almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;dialectical fashion against entropy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     SS: My take is that this works WITH the Second Law.  Indeed, since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all gradients are unstable to metastable, they all must be dissipated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Autocatalysis, and any building-up tendency, is simply parasitic upon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this necessary dissipation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wouldn't agree. I can conceive of gradients existing for indeterminate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time without being dissipated. That's why we had fossil fuels. Human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;society, which arose out of the solar gradient, for reasons vested in its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;own autocatalytic economy, sought out and switched to fossil fuels to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;serve those ends. Fossil fuels didn't force themselves upon humans, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;did they beckon to humans simply to be dissipated (some current wasteful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human activities notwithstanding. :)
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS:  First, my point about gradient instability is that it is
<br />
perfectly general.  No energy gradient can survive forever.  They are
<br />
CONSTITUTIONALLY destined, in this disequilibrated Universe, for
<br />
dissipation.  So, e.g., in their formal representations there must be a
<br />
factor diminishing them, whose value may be large (as, say, in a coconut)
<br />
or very small (as in an oil field prior to industrialization).  Who would
<br />
have guessed that the alloy of lead used 500 years ago in pipe organs would
<br />
now begin to corrode?  All gradients will eventually dissipate, awaiting
<br />
only encounter with a system for which they become 'available'.
<br />
&nbsp;Next, we must consider scale here.  People don't use oil, industrial
<br />
culture's do.  At the timescale of entities the size of industrial cultures
<br />
(where a coup d'oeul of ours is comparable to maybe a year), the oil has
<br />
not been waiting very long since being formed for its dissipation.  On this
<br />
head, note that vegetation had to wait a long time before animals developed
<br />
the ability to to consume it, with the evolution of bacterial gut flora.
<br />
(Indeed, it was prior to this that the oil, and coal, got a chance to be
<br />
deposited.) The oil was dissipated as soon as it could be.  Otherwise one
<br />
needs to show an example where some economic possibility arose and was
<br />
deliberately left unexplored.
<br />
Finally, the more determinate evolution is, the more likely one can predict
<br />
that, say, industrialization will arise to consume fossil fuels.
<br />
Darwinians do not believe in determinacy in evolution, but there are many
<br />
examples of parallel and convergent evolution of different biological
<br />
lineages, as well as convergences of whole biotas.  These are not
<br />
understood today partly because Darwinians do not recognize these
<br />
phenomena, and they rule the evolution roost by disbursing the purse.  So,
<br />
taking a radical position, I will propose that the evolution (really
<br />
development) of ANY planet of the same type as ours will go through roughly
<br />
the same stages as ours has, and in that scenario the energy in fossil
<br />
fuels will be consumed at a particular stage.
<br />
<p>________________
<br />
Replying to Pedro, who said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Economy is not a domain of energies and entropies but of information and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge --entirely within the symbolic realm.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This opinion on economy is similar to the one evidently behind the
<br />
shift toward the entirely idealistic world of instant computer trading in
<br />
the stock markets -- a trend which, in my opinion, will destroy our economy
<br />
by overheating aspects of it.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Only one species among 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;millions on Earth (over 40 or 50 millions?) has developed such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sumperimposed world of &quot;economy&quot;. Why? Just for the same entropy/energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;reasons&quot; applying to any happenstance? One needs a robust language,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;artificial ecosystems, a counting system, a socialization network,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elementary institutions, etc., in order than one can progressively assist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the emergence of universal equivalents, currencies, values, markets,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;economic networks&quot;, cultures, etc.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Every species has its own inventions.  Each has its own economy,
<br />
as Aleks points out.  Our characteristic invention was language &amp;
<br />
associated mentality.  None of these inventions allows escape from the
<br />
stringencies of the material world (which I freely admit is both boring and
<br />
terrifying -- I prefer poetry and music myself).  If we do not locate our
<br />
economy in the material world, we will exclude understanding of
<br />
'externalities' at our peril.  Furthermore, I think that if one wishes to
<br />
argue for the reality in evolution of de novo appearances that have no
<br />
precursors, it is incumbent upon that person to first argue for de novo
<br />
appearance in general.  This would be to argue for miracles, I'm afraid.
<br />
Classical economics is being rebuffed even by many economists, in favor of
<br />
a more materialist perspective rooted in ecology.  I always try to root my
<br />
thinking in the whole of science, not just in one discipline.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unfortunately, social information is misunderstood yet (and pragmatically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mistreated by social disciplines). How could one run a discussion on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computing &amp;software in entropy grounds?, not much practically indeed.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: As the main perpetrator of the entropy viewpoint, I can only say
<br />
in my defense that I have no objection to anyone pursuing other avenues of
<br />
investigation.  Let all flowers bloom!  I have not prevented alternative
<br />
perspectives with my paltry two postings per week!
<br />
_________________
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to Bob's support for Pedro's views:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bateson distinguishes between &quot;pleroma&quot;, which are the mindless,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indistinguishable elements of physics, and &quot;creatura&quot; which in my lexicon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;translates as configurations of processes occuring among distinguishable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex entities. Of interest here is that Bateson allows that pleroma
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be treated adequately using only material and efficient causalities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is ONLY when one regards creatura that the need arises to invoke final
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causality.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Here I can only say that I champion the use of ALL causal agencies
<br />
for all phenomena.  Let me hear detailed arguments why I should not exaine
<br />
this possibilitu.  I have explained carefully how I proceed with this, as,
<br />
say, with purpose: {physical teleomaty {biological teleonomy {human
<br />
teleology}}}.  The viewpoint on physics stated by Bob is that deriving from
<br />
the time before dissipative structures were understood, and were relegated
<br />
to 'applications'.  When, instead, one sees dissipative structures as the
<br />
fundamental dynamical entities at all integrative levels, the picture
<br />
changes.  This all came about after Bateson's thinking.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I discover a new way of expressing what I have been trying to say in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this discussion, namely that the proper agency behind final cause (i.e.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that which calls the system into the future) should be a creatur (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;autocatalytic configurations inherent in ecological and economic systems)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and not a pleron(?) (like entropy.)
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: In fact, autocatalytic systems occur at all integrative levels,
<br />
and are associated with, if not being themselves, dissipative structures.
<br />
<p>As this posting is now rather long, I will wait 'til next week for my next
<br />
installment.
