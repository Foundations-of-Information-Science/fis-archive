<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>There have been a number of interesting ideas exchanged these days. I am 
<br />
responding to a few from Cristophe, John, and Jerry.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristophe:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;....The meaningfullness of an information comes from the origin of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information. If the information has been produced by a system that has no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraint to satisfy, then the information cannot be meaningful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The meaningful information is meanningful relatively to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraint S of the MGS (we should speak about &quot;meaningful (S)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information&quot;, or &quot;meaning (S)&quot;). And a meaningful information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transmitted to other systems will be able to participate to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;action satisfying the constrain S only if the receiver system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is submitted to the same constraint S.
</em><br />
<p>Probably what you say makes a lot of sense from the point of view of 
<br />
computer science and agent modelling. And I concur that your 'constraint' 
<br />
approach is very elegant and intriguing as a computational strategy. 
<br />
However, biologically the problem looks different. The meaning is built by 
<br />
the living entity after the 'mysterious' abduction process has lead the 
<br />
receiver to converge on that particular item distinguished as info. 
<br />
Converging or not belongs exclusively to the receiver part; afterwards 
<br />
meaning will be 'fabricated' in a fast/medium/long term; and quite probably 
<br />
within a molecular-decay process that will also affect that 'meaning'. The 
<br />
passing of time dramatically alters the meaning, content, salience, 
<br />
relevance, etc. that we have initially felt or experienced, or elaborated.
<br />
In any case, your return to the 'constraint' notion is very welcome, as we 
<br />
could not close 'meaningfully' the cellular discussion months ago. I am 
<br />
still pondering about that.
<br />
<p>John's reference to Michael Conrad is very opportune too. In my opinion, we 
<br />
have never discussed the fabric of his 'adaptability theory' at all; and 
<br />
after reading Kevin Kirby's paper in BioSystems Vol. 64, 2002, an excellent 
<br />
popularization of Michael's pretty arcane theory, I really think that it 
<br />
provides the overall arch on 'cellular adaptability' where we may insert 
<br />
both the molecular recognition theme (en passant: Shu-Kun has a great, 
<br />
great paper about it) and the abduction intermediate level 
<br />
conceptualization. If for whatever reason this discussion cannot be 
<br />
advanced in some of the next sessions, I would like to suggest an ad hoc 
<br />
one with Kevin and Shu Kun (and maybe other parties) as our special invitees.
<br />
<p>About that quotation of Wordsworth on the ear and the eye: we 'see' but 
<br />
also keep our inner circadian clocks on day-night time through eye 
<br />
non-vision receptors, also we both emit and receive a lot of social info 
<br />
(eg, romantic) on the very motions of the eye, blind people too, and our 
<br />
eyes have evolved to show a big contrast sclerotic/iris unknown in other 
<br />
primates... As for the ear, it additionally computes our sense of 
<br />
equilibrium too. In short, cramming into just one reductionist word the 
<br />
function of our bodily (or molecular!) elements is not wise. But I should 
<br />
not contradict the admirable poet...
<br />
<p>David Bohm on 'paper-ing' may be misleading.
