                <p>
                    Dear Igor and colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>I don't buy your definitions of &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; as being necessarily
                    <br />
                    homogenized under a dominant one which can be simplified as &quot;materialism&quot;,
                    <br />
                    &quot;rationality&quot; and &quot;Protestant ethic&quot;. I think that we have moved in
                    <br />
                    sociology beyond these Weberian definitions. However, I agree that the other
                    <br />
                    issue is more interesting for the discussion on this list. (Perhaps, the two
                    <br />
                    problems cannot so easily be separated, but let us assume that for a
                    <br />
                    moment.)
                    <br />
                <p>The transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based economy is
                    <br />
                    not to be placed at the middle of the 20th century as your email suggested,
                    <br />
                    since this has been a post-Coldwar development. The first documents using
                    <br />
                    the words &quot;knowledge-based economy&quot; in OECD circles are from 1996 (on the
                    <br />
                    basis of drafts from 1994). Thus, we are talking about a current transition.
                    <br />
                    For example, this transition was central to the Lisbon agreements of the EU
                    <br />
                    summit of 2000.
                    <br />
                <p>What is the difference? Let me take a simple example. Compare two megacities
                    <br />
                    like Calcutta and New York. Both have of the order of 10^7 inhabitants. New
                    <br />
                    York is much more resource-intensive (in terms of using energy, etc.) than
                    <br />
                    Calcutta, but few of us would consider Calcutta as more sustainable than New
                    <br />
                    York. For example, in New York the streets are reasonably maintained and
                    <br />
                    clean, and one lives with much less risk of infections, etc.
                    <br />
                <p>What makes the difference between Calcutta and New York? I would say a
                    <br />
                    knowledge-based infrastructure like first a sewage system, but then also a
                    <br />
                    telephone system, a subway system, etc. In short, a whole set of
                    <br />
                    communication networks in New York which does not exist in Calcutta. The
                    <br />
                    system is better sustainable because a set of coordination mechanisms is in
                    <br />
                    place which proliferates on top of &quot;hardware&quot;.
                    <br />
                <p>Let us formalize this notion of communication systems which are added to the
                    <br />
                    people. As noted above, the N of both systems is of the order of 10^7. The
                    <br />
                    communication systems can be considered as an M. Thus a matrix N x M is
                    <br />
                    shaped. In the case of Calcutta N dominates this matrix and therefore the
                    <br />
                    system is &quot;natural&quot;. As M expands, it can take over the dynamics. The
                    <br />
                    supporting capacity of the system (the maximum entropy) is N x M. The
                    <br />
                    extension of M to (M + 1) enlarges the matrix with N (= 10^) possibilities.
                    <br />
                    The extension of M is knowledge-based, while the extension of N is
                    <br />
                    resource-based.
                    <br />
                <p>Please, note that this has nothing to do with &quot;materialsm&quot;, &quot;realism&quot; or &quot;a
                    <br />
                    Protestant work ethic&quot; as you wished to suggest.
                    <br />
                <p>With kind regards,
                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Loet
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your remarks! Our definition of &quot;worldview&quot; is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically equal to the term Weltanschauung, and differs only
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that it explicitly introduces objective knowledge as its
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitutive part - a distinction that is methodologically
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate for analysis of Western societies. We do
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; acknowledge the existence of mutually competing worldviews,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; but there is always a dominant one that streamlines
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; collective behavior. We can, for example, condense the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; prevailing (Western) worldview around three basic
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions: materialism, rationality and hard-wired working
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; ethic (details are presented in Matutinovic, forthcoming in

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (dimensions), but any such combination of values and beliefs
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be internally coherent and it must logically link to the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; extant institutional framework. The very existence of

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mention it, provides one of the pillars of societal

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is too much
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conceptualized as a single and closed system like a Kuhnian

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradigm.

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Holland naturally (because of the lack of sunshine). The

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can be considered as sources of innovation, for example, when market
