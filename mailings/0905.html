<p>
In reply to Rafael's question on time and the stone, my answer may be
<br />
difficult to accept, because, as I understand it, you are a
<br />
phenomenologist and consider that reality exists only within an
<br />
internal perspective. However, I'll try to explain my point from
<br />
within my very different understadning, which uses both internal and
<br />
external measurements.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone is a physical Form,, and as such, exists in all three
<br />
temporal modes of measurements: progressive, perfect and present. The
<br />
stone is composed of chemicals that remain the same, in their
<br />
composition,  in Progressive time. That is, the chemical composition
<br />
has a continuity (past/future) regardless of whether those chemicals
<br />
are 'morphed' into This Stone or That Stone. The chemicals that make
<br />
up 'diamond' have a continuity of reality regardless of whether they
<br />
are formed into a 2 carat or 5 carat form.  The stone, in its
<br />
particular contextual form (that 2 carat, or that 5 carat) operates in
<br />
its uniqueness in Perfect time. It is measured, encoded as 'that
<br />
particular diamond' within a temporal measurement that has added
<br />
another temporal dimension - that of singular crisp particularity.
<br />
That's a temporal mode of measurement that organizes matter quite
<br />
differently than within the continuity of Progressive time.It's an
<br />
external mode of measurement.
<br />
Now, that same stone also exists in itself, in the nowness of now, so
<br />
to speak, in Present time - regardless of its distinct form.This is a
<br />
strictly internal mode of organization and sets up the matter/stone as
<br />
a cohesive whole - a mode of existence quite different from the
<br />
differentiation capacities of Perfect time, and quite different from
<br />
the continuous capacities of Progressive time.
<br />
<p>Time is not a separate linear scale, against which we measure
<br />
ourselves (oh, that's our past; and this is the present; and we'd
<br />
better plan for the future). That sets up time as only one type of
<br />
measurement; a referential abstract ruler, against which we measure
<br />
ourselves - but which, in a way, has nothing to do with the actual
<br />
composition of ourselves - and acts only as a reference. Much like an
<br />
ID card. That's not the type of temporal measurement that I am using
<br />
in my semiotics. In my semiotics, time is an actual means of
<br />
measurement that acts to form the 'final product'. It actually becomes
<br />
a component of the 'matter'. Matter exists and has the capacity to
<br />
interact differently, according to the temporal measurement that is
<br />
used to form that matter. So, matter operating in a present mode
<br />
behaves quite differently than matter operating in a perfect
<br />
mode...and quite differently when operating in a progressive mode.
<br />
<p>Sounds a bit odd??!!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is phenomenologically not clear to me, how, say, a stone,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes by itself (!) a difference between past, present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and future. I am not intending to contradict your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradiction. I do not like *doctrines*... I am just trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to better *see*... This may (!) be another way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coming up with reality as the usual *causal* one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably we have *very* different philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pre-understandings such that it is no possible to clarify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them through this medium, also because of... time!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind regards
