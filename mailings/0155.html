<p>
Greg,
<br />
<p>Maybe this quotation can make things more clear. It is from Bertrand Russel
<br />
in his_Outline of Philosophy_ (Chapter 22, p. 180):
<br />
&quot;As a provisional definition, we may take ethics to consist of general
<br />
principles which help to determine rules of conduct (...)
<br />
It is not the business of ethics to arrive at actual rules of conduct, such
<br />
as: 'Thou shalt not steal'. This is the province of morals. Ethics is
<br />
expected to provide a basis from which such rules can be deduced. The rules
<br />
of morals differ according to the age, the race (sic!), and the creed of the
<br />
community concerned, to an extent that is hardly realised by those who have
<br />
neither travelled nor studied anthropology (...)
<br />
Those who question this moral rule (of headhunters!RC) are held to be
<br />
encouraging licence and lowering the standard of manliness. Nevertheless, we
<br />
should not demand of an ethic that it should justify the moral rules of
<br />
head-hunters.&quot;
<br />
I hope this quotation makes you (also) laugh!
<br />
<p>In the German tradition (German Idealism) we have the distinction between
<br />
Morality (_Moralitaet_) and _Sittlichkeit_. Kant is a representative of the
<br />
Moralitaet-tradition which gives primacy to universal rules, disregarding
<br />
their _Sitz im Leben_. Hegel argues against this _abstract_ view of morality
<br />
by stressing the necessary incarnation of morality in a concrete community
<br />
(something we call today _solidarity_). Morality is different from law (=
<br />
norms politically sanctioned and instantiated through _power_). (See. Hegel:
<br />
Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts)
<br />
_Sittlichkeit_ corresponds to what I called _morals_ which indeed goes back,
<br />
as you say, to Greek _ethos_
<br />
There is a famous quotation from Aristotle _Nichomachean Ethics_ (1103a
<br />
14-18) where he states:
<br />
&quot;The _arete_  (virtue) is of two kinds, _dianoethical_ and _ethical_
<br />
_dianoethical_ virtue arises and grows mainly by means of instruction, it
<br />
needs therefore experience and time
<br />
_ethical_ virtue comes into being through customs (_ex ethous_), its name is
<br />
derived from there, as the word _ethical_ is just very similar to _custom_&quot;
<br />
<p>The similarity of the two words is based on Greek short _e_ (epsilon) and
<br />
long _e_ (etha): _ethical_ virtue is written with ethca whereaa customs is
<br />
written with epsilon. This means, that an _ethical_ character (in a personal
<br />
or social meaning) is produced by habits.
<br />
The word _ethos_ (with etha) means, as you correctly remark, the living
<br />
customs (Latin: mores) or the place where human being _live_, which is also
<br />
the primary meaning of this word.
<br />
Aristotles writes an _ethics_ i.e. he is reflecting on the _ethos_ (in two
<br />
ways: the things we learn through intellectual teaching (dianoethical
<br />
virtues: _dianoia_ means _intellect_ or _reason_: _dia-nous) (such as
<br />
_techne_ (the knowledge of how to produce (material) things), _episteme_
<br />
(knowledge about the _causes_, _phronesis_ which is the kind of knowledge we
<br />
apply when we think _ethically_ i.e. when we try to act according to general
<br />
rules but (!) in a specific situation, _sophia_ (the highest kind of
<br />
theoretical knowledge)
<br />
With regard to the _ethical_ virtues there is the classic tradition of:
<br />
- thoughtfulness (German: Besonnenheit), G. _sophrosyne_
<br />
- justice (_dikaiosyne_)
<br />
- courage (_andreia_)
<br />
- generosity (_eleutheriotes_)
<br />
and others
<br />
This _virtues_ are mainly _man_oriented, as they were grounded in the Greek
<br />
_ethos_...
<br />
<p>Aristotle distinguished  theoretical from practical philosophy (which were
<br />
_identified_ in some way by Plato: to know the good is _the same_ (or
<br />
implies necessarily?) to do it) and by doing so he detaches practical
<br />
philosophy from the _absolute_ norms derived from _eternal being_ (the _sky_
<br />
as well as the _prime mover_). He lookes for what is good to a being that
<br />
changes and whose actions (_praxis_) are not just the ones of producing
<br />
material things (_poiesis_). According to these there is a difference
<br />
between _episteme_ as the knowledge of permanent things (later: natural
<br />
laws), and of changing things (these can be: to know hat to produce material
<br />
thinks:_teche_, or how to be oneself a _better_ human being by acting in
<br />
specific situations, this kind of _practical_ knowledge is called
<br />
_phronesis_). So we have:
<br />
praxis - phronesis
<br />
poiesis - techne
<br />
episteme (sophia)
<br />
Finally Aristotle includes in his Practical Philosophy not only _Ethics_
<br />
(relating this term to the _individual_) but also _Economy_ (from Greek:
<br />
_oikos_ the house: the rules of leading or managing the house/family) and
<br />
_Politics_
<br />
<p>This Aristotelian distinctions were basic for hundreds (!) of years in the
<br />
Western tradition.
<br />
Modernity brought basic changes introducing the idea of liberty (or freedom)
<br />
and _subjectivity_
<br />
Kant made a sharp distinction between the Ought of morality (obligation,
<br />
_Pflicht_) considering all other aspects of human endavour (particularly the
<br />
ones related to the pursue of the _good_ or of _happiness_ which are so
<br />
basic for the Empiricist and Anglo-Amercan tradition and which go back to
<br />
the Greek tradition of looking for the _good_ in a manner according to a
<br />
finite being (Aristotle: _ta anthropina_) as non pertaining to _Morality_.
<br />
This Kantian _rigorism_ had a great influence on our Western _morality_ (or
<br />
_ethos_) and was questionned by existential philosophers such as Nietzsche
<br />
or in our century by Sartre, Heidegger, Foucault etc.
<br />
To look as what is good (for me/us) in a particular situation as a _value_
<br />
is a modern _economic_ perspective as far as it relates the _being_ of
<br />
things to the _calculating_ (or _utilitaristic_ ) view of man. The excess of
<br />
this view is a catastrophic _anthropocentrism_ which values everything
<br />
according to his/her interests. Ecologic ethics as well as ethical thinking
<br />
related to the _rights_ of (other) animals/living beings was the answer to
<br />
this onesidedness.
<br />
<p>Well, all this is very academic!
<br />
cheers
<br />
Rafael

Betreff: Social Information (reply to Capurro)
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rafael--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree these are very &quot;tricky formulations for designing very different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things.&quot;  It was ian attempt, admiteddly bound to fail, to capture these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differences that I used all three terms.  I had spent some time asking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anglo-American philosophers if there were a difference between &quot;ethics&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;morals&quot; and was told Morals relates to sex and Ethics relates to the rest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That disappointed me so totally I decided to make up my own meanings.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result is not exactly what you said.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, Aristotle's use of the root word &quot;ethos&quot; suggests that customs and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mores was at work in his formulation.  Also, I wanted to get at some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what Durkheim said about religion.  Finally, there is a nice academic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cottage industry in America (see MacIntyre, e.g.) which describes ethics as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the form of knowledge for determing what is moral.  The older tradition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which ranks Morals as primary and Ethics as legalistic and secondary was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;less appealing to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway, I would make the following distinctions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;morals&quot; = the symbolic representation of end-states;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;ethics&quot; = the rules for achieving these end-states; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;values&quot; = the relative positive or negative weightings attached to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;end-states.  (The latter comes close to the Homeric notion of dividing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spoils properly, which was also in Aristotle's mind.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Morals sanction organizational structures; ethics teach people how to act
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so those sanctioned structures can be reached; and values are the emotional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;triggers motivating action.  So, if people &quot;know&quot; where they ought to be,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a sense of how to get there, and are excited about the prospects, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my supposition is they will be inclined to pick certain behavioral options
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather than others and a social system will endure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I was, in any case, trying to get at is the totality of elements that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must be involved to influence human choices and actions in ways that could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;account for the otherwise miraculous fact that societies endure over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I thought there was more to it than any one of those terms in isolation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would imply, so I put them all together.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, any thing like a social system will replicate because of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information stored in it MEANS, which is why I also tried to link the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem of social information to an environmental context.  Thus, some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moral statement like &quot;Thou shalt not ...&quot; generally speaking does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually prohibit the behavior it specifies, for there are rules for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defining the .... which apply in various ways in multiple situations with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;diverse results.  This makes for problems, of course, but it also is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;makes social systems, unlike crystals, dynamic, evolving, self-trasnforming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am wondering if something like a value-free definition of value, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part of what I am after, implies our societies have relaxed their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraints to the point where evolution is virtually continuoius, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individuals are always able to fluctuate social structures by choosing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something unexpected or new.  Are we at &quot;the edge of chaos&quot; and, if so, can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we handle the stress?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Once again, Rafael, your contributions to these discussions prove really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;valuable.  Thanks for taking the time.
