Information Technological Biology/Biological Information Technology
<br />
<p>Ray Paton
<br />
<p><p><p>The two-way displacement of ideas between the biosciences
<br />
and engineering/technology has a long history. In this century
<br />
we have seen many developments - too many to list. However,
<br />
lets briefly pursue one:
<br />
<p>what is a brain - a telephone exchange, a computer
<br />
what is a neuron - a switch, a microprocessor, the multiplex neuron,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a computer
<br />
<p>Here we have some mechano-electrical ideas.
<br />
<p>Another would be that the brain is a gland
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or memory is hologram etc.
<br />
<p>So it should come as no surprise that in looking for more
<br />
general ideas are displaced from technology.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature gets writ in technological terms.
<br />
<p>Technology can also be writ in natural terms. DNA 'computing'
<br />
was around a long time before Adleman. However, you didn't need a
<br />
Turing machine to understand or argue about it.
<br />
<p>The purpose of this short contribution to the FIS discussion
<br />
is to consider the scope and limitations of this two-way
<br />
exchange SPECIFICALLY in relation to our understanding
<br />
of Biological Information Processing Systems.
<br />
<p>When we ask the question about whether bioinformation
<br />
is (should be) corpuscular or abstract object or process
<br />
or some'thing' like energy or part of an equation.
<br />
Maybe the parallel with phlogiston is 'phlogging a dead horse'.
<br />
Rather, the construct we are looking for could have more
<br />
to do with the debates/discussions that gave
<br />
rise to the notion of energy in the nineteenth century.
<br />
There again, information is maybe a third category
<br />
as Werner and others have argued.
<br />
<p><p>Getting beyond the Syntax - The Notion of 'Smart'
<br />
------------------------------------------------
<br />
One of the problems I feel that underpins this debate
<br />
about bioinformation is concerned with meaning which in
<br />
turn often gets conflated either with syntax and linguistics
<br />
or sign and semiotics. To be sure these are valuable
<br />
ideas but so too is the cognitive dimension [as espoused by
<br />
various authors such as Kampis, Erdi, Varela etc etc ...]
<br />
<p><p>'Smart' is used to describe a number of engineering materials
<br />
and it should come as no surprise that proteins and maybe to a lesser
<br />
extent DNA fall into this category. When discussing the idea of smartness
<br />
we look around for some valuable sources. These might include:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- -  parallel distributed processing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- -  cognitive agents
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- -  emergent computation
<br />
<p>Consider some examples of proteins which exhibit 'smartness'.
<br />
Kinases and phosphatases would fall into this category.
<br />
Also, we could suggest that a transcription complex is particularly
<br />
smart or proteins involved in DNA methylation with relation to
<br />
imprinting and epigenetic inheritance systems - - in my view
<br />
that is definitely when smary/clever etc become useful adjectives.
<br />
The context-sensitivity and multifunctionality showed by
<br />
say CaM Kinase II illustrates the point about enzyme action.
<br />
Michael Conrad has talked about a seed-germination model
<br />
because of the complex of factors that can be involved. Dennis Bray
<br />
has drawn parallels with PDP networks and Pedro,
<br />
Rick Welch and others make use of society ideas. We have also looked
<br />
at a number of computational analogues namely:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  Enzymes as 'Logical' Agents (using ideas from emergent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and distributed AI) such as autonomous and adaptive agents.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  Enzyme as Verb (to emphasise the process, network and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spatio-temporal aspects)
<br />
<p>You could say that some genes are 'smarter' than others for example,
<br />
the genes coding for regulatory proteins in prokaryotic hirearchies
<br />
such as regulons and modulons.
<br />
<p><p>Think BioProcess - Think Micro[meso] process
<br />
--------------------------------------------
<br />
The metaphor of cell as a chemical lab etc is OK so long as
<br />
even the reaction vessels are viewed as highly organised. This focusses
<br />
attention on small scale thinking rather than bulk processes
<br />
in big vats. This affects our thinking about
<br />
<p>What is a genome ?
<br />
IS it just a bag of genes - - NO.
<br />
And a metabolism is not a bag of enzymes.
<br />
<p>Structure and spatial heterogeneity play a key role.
<br />
This related to micro-compartmentation and also to the roles
<br />
of the internal skeleton. Maybe an intersting parallel here
<br />
is that just as macro skeletons play multifunctional roles
<br />
so do cyto and nuclear skeletons. Eslewhere, I describe this apsect
<br />
of bioinformation as the 'stage'.
<br />
Put another way, information=form [Thom].
<br />
<p>Some eukaryotic genomes have more than 95% non-protein coding DNA.
<br />
If you were thinking of chemical lab/factory ideas
<br />
then you might say your system is only 5% efficient.
<br />
But info is NOT just about a code. Indeed, there are several codes.
<br />
Maybe emphasis on 'code' prevents a richer understanding anyway.
<br />
<p>How important is structural information?
<br />
What about the roles of mobile genetic elements?
<br />
What does this say about biological information - it is dynamic.
<br />
Fluid genomes require a wider number of information processing
<br />
ideas [see eg Shapiro, Thaler, etc...]. Hierarchical thinking
<br />
in many ways requires information as GLUE.
<br />
<p><p>Think Smart - Think Ecology
<br />
----------------------------
<br />
The [so-called] code-script of Schrodinger is
<br />
NOT JUST Harware AND software AND data. An ecological
<br />
perspective on the interactions between the script,
<br />
the actors and the stage is needed.
<br />
<p>To return to the issue of engineering/technology and biology,
<br />
Jim Shapiro asks whether evolution is more about [natural]
<br />
genetic engineering than the workings of a blind watchmaker.
<br />
If biocience has anything in common with information technology
<br />
this seems a very interesting question to ask.
<br />
<p>Ecological thinking brings us back to semiotic, thermodynamic
<br />
and spatiotemporal issues.
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All true biologists desrve the coveted name of naturalist.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touchstone of the naturalist is his abiding interest in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIVING Nature in all its aspects&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1936)
<br />
<p><p>SO in any replies please give some specific examples.
<br />
<p><p>HOW CAN ALL THESE IDEAS BE INTEGRATED ???
<br />
=========================================
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIOINFORMATION=GLUE
<br />
<p>If anyone is interested we could explain further.
