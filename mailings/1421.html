<p>
Please excuse my tardiness in joining the discussion initiated by
<br />
Michel. Perhaps when I am done with my idiosyncratic comments, several
<br />
of you will wish I had simply remained silent. :)
<br />
<p>To begin with, most of us recall that Shannon named his measure &quot;entropy&quot;
<br />
after the humorous suggestion by von Neumann. Von Neumann was asked by
<br />
Shannon what to name the formula, H=-Sum(i) pi log(pi)? Von Neumann
<br />
replied rather coyly that he should name it entropy, because (1) the
<br />
measure is formally the same as that used by Boltzmann in his statistical
<br />
mechanical treatment of irreversibility, and (2) &quot;Nobody really
<br />
understands what entropy is, so you will be at an advantage in any
<br />
discusssion!&quot; It was a clever, mischievous response, but Shannon
<br />
apparently took him seriously, and it became a bad joke on all of us!
<br />
<p>I was educated as a chemical engineer, and one of the shibboleths of
<br />
our upbringing was that thermodynamics is a purely phenomenological and
<br />
macroscopic endeavor. Any student attempting to break this taboo paid a
<br />
drastic price for his/her impertinence. Hence, at any formal exam, if a
<br />
student were responding to a question in thermodynamics and chanced to
<br />
mention the term &quot;atom&quot; or &quot;molecule&quot; a virtual gong would sound, the
<br />
student would be interrupted and told to leave the room. He/she had
<br />
failed and would be banished to where there is weeping and gnashing of
<br />
teeth! :)
<br />
<p>The reasoning was that thermodynamics rests on a phenomenological
<br />
foundation that is far more solid than any atomic &quot;hypothesis&quot;. After all,
<br />
in 1820 when Sadi Carnot described the behavior of engines that pumped
<br />
water from mines, he did so from a purely phenomenological perspective.
<br />
That his conception of irreversibility happened to collide with the
<br />
prevailing notions of conservation and temporal symmetry (which Aemelie
<br />
Noether later told us were equivalent) was of little consequence to an
<br />
engineer. But it put the physicists' view of the world in serious
<br />
jeopardy. For the next 30 to 50 years it was the atomic hypothesis, not
<br />
the second law (which, incidentally, was discovered before the first) that
<br />
was truly at risk.
<br />
<p>We all know that this conflict was finally resolved when Boltzmann and
<br />
Gibbs constructed statistical mechanics as a bridge between
<br />
thermodynamics and physics -- or at least we think we know. As Michel
<br />
suggested, it was an exceedingly narrow bridge, indeed! Consider the
<br />
following: The positivist notion of science is that one should be
<br />
continually trying to disprove hypotheses -- to subject them to all
<br />
manner of rigorous tests. Well, the atomic hypothesis was clearly at
<br />
risk and what did we do? We discovered a miniscule range of phenomena
<br />
across which there was some correspondence between the two conflicting
<br />
disciplines and we immediately called a halt to the dialogue! We
<br />
considered the hypothesis proven.
<br />
<p>I would submit that there is more to these rantings than mere fancy on
<br />
my part. Consider that whenever a physicist is asked about
<br />
thermodynamics, the response is almost invariably from the perspective
<br />
of statistical mechanics. For most physicists, STATISTICAL MECHANICS *IS*
<br />
THERMODYNAMICS. Thermodynamics in its phenomenological guise continues
<br />
to pose a major challenge to physics. It is the blackberry seed in the
<br />
wisdom tooth of the physicist. The response is to envelop
<br />
thermodynamics within the safe cocoon of stat mech.
<br />
<p>As Shu-Kun pointed out, entropy and information are opposites, and we
<br />
would do well not to confound them. It is possible to measure entropy
<br />
purely in terms of energetic changes. In fact, the variables of
<br />
thermodynamics are all naturally skewed towards the energetic. Most
<br />
constraints enter thermo via external boundaries (although some
<br />
constraints are embedded to an extent in state variables like the Gibbs
<br />
free energy.)
<br />
<p>Information, on the other hand, is dominated by constraint. (In fact, I
<br />
argued earlier that information could be understood purely in terms of
<br />
constraint.) Not that it is always necessary to know the details of the
<br />
constraints explicitly. Just as one can phenomenologically measure
<br />
thermodynamical variables in ignorance of molecular movements, one can
<br />
also gauge the level of information according to their effects and in
<br />
abstraction from knowing exactly how the constraints are working.
<br />
<p>So I would conclude with a plea to respect the autonomy of
<br />
thermodynamics from statistical mechanics -- that whatever overlap
<br />
entropy might have with probabilistic notions pales in comparison with
<br />
its meaning in a physical, energetic sense. None of which is to
<br />
diminish the value and utility of Shannon's probabilistic measure,
<br />
which has been enormous. It's just a plea to call it something like
<br />
&quot;uncertainty&quot;, &quot;indeterminacy&quot; or even (heaven forbid!) &quot;complexity&quot;,
<br />
but at all costs to avoid calling it &quot;entropy&quot;!
<br />
<p>Regards to all,
<br />
Bob
