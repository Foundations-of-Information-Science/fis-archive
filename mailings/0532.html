<p>
Dear Karl, Rafael and Colleagues:
<br />
<p>At last, the discussion is beginning to address some of the basic 
<br />
issues of communication.
<br />
<p>Rafael, your post suggests that traditional metaphysics can be 
<br />
extended to include the concept of &quot;information&quot;.  But, you do not 
<br />
provide us with a clue on how this extension is created. In your 
<br />
view, does the extension of metaphysics to information require the 
<br />
consideration of matter only?  Or is time also necessary?  And what 
<br />
about space?  Or, the metaphysics of message genesis?  Or, the 
<br />
metaphysics of message utilization?  These questions are pointed at 
<br />
the Shannon view of communication, where two or more systems and a 
<br />
process of transmission are required for communication.  In the 
<br />
Shannon model, which is extraordinarily successful for engineering 
<br />
purposes, the model requires two or more systems.  Does your 
<br />
metaphysic extension of &quot;information&quot; require two or more systems 
<br />
(beings)?  This question is significant, in part, because 
<br />
thermodynamics, as a bilinear group, is restricted to one system and 
<br />
the &quot;non-system&quot; surrounding the closure of the system.  (Many forget 
<br />
that Shannon's mathematics is restricted mainly to the  engineering 
<br />
problems of reproducible transmission between two systems and 
<br />
generally does not address message generation or message utilization.)
<br />
<p>Karl, I had a very difficult time attempting to understand your message.
<br />
In your usage of the term, &quot;things&quot;, are your referring to matter, 
<br />
for example, physical or chemical particles?  Or does your usage 
<br />
exclude the concept of microscopic &quot;things&quot;?
<br />
<p>When you say:
<br />
In fact, once we agree about what is a &quot;thing&quot;, then we shall have 
<br />
solved all our deep problems, then only calibrational, technical 
<br />
questions remain.
<br />
<p>the intent of your sentence is unclear, unless you merely wish to 
<br />
echo Laplace's views in a 21 st century context.
<br />
<p>When you say:
<br />
Let me propose a very technical approach to what we may call a 
<br />
&quot;thing&quot;. This central concept involves every other concept also, 
<br />
because it can only be explained in the tension between &quot;now&quot; and 
<br />
(&quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot;); &quot;is&quot; as opposed to &quot;could also have been&quot;; 
<br />
&quot;such&quot; as opposed to &quot;any kind of properties&quot;.
<br />
<p>it appears that you are assuming a philosophy that ignores Rafael's 
<br />
proposition that:
<br />
Of course it is possible to say: everything
<br />
that is, is information (as we can say:
<br />
everything that is, is matter or whatever).
<br />
<p>by substituting the notion of &quot;thing&quot; for the notion of &quot;information.&quot;
<br />
<p>Your &quot;very technical approach&quot; could be translated as a special type 
<br />
of super-reductionism by incorporating temporal relations and 
<br />
conditional propositions into materialism.  Can you relate this &quot;very 
<br />
technical approach&quot; to complex systems and such problems as evolution?
<br />
<p>In your summary:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To summarise:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- talking in logical sentences that have exact meaning one talks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about relations of concepts to each other: this means using numbers;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- considering whether I talk about a collection (&quot;cross-section&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;now&quot;) or about a sequence, I discover that I can say differing many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical sentences;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- matching the sentences that describe as well a process and as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well a state (the momentary state and the next step in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one-and-the-same sentence) I shall find some sentences that remain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unexplained (the moment contains more material than the past or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future); then I know what I shall term the &quot;thing&quot;.
</em><br />
<p>the concept of time is intertwined with the concept of number.  How 
<br />
do you justify this interrelation?  At issue is the nature of 
<br />
continuity.
<br />
<p>Your conjecture:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
This may appear useless gibberish but I assure you that it can be 
<br />
translated into very solid number theory.
<br />
<p>is intriguing.  I find no foundation for a theory of time or 
<br />
metaphysics within number theory.  More critically, from a 
<br />
theoretical chemical point of view, I am skeptical that number theory 
<br />
can be extended directly to either chemical structures or chemical 
<br />
dynamics, both of which are closely related to graph theory.
<br />
<p>Karl, you have introduced a number of interesting issues.  I look 
<br />
forward to learning how you propose to transcend the gap between well 
<br />
established principles of number theory and the concepts of 
<br />
communication between two or more systems.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
<br />
<p>PS:  Karl, I complement your adherence to the rules proposed by 
<br />
Pedro.  I hope others will follow your example.
<br />
<p><p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Rafael and colleagues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I adhere to Pedro's two messages per week rule --so the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apparent delay of this replay.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I have understood right (see mess. below), you state, Rafael, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that in order to understand the concept of information, one should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first clarify the meaning of the term &quot;thing&quot;. To this end you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;propose 3 ways of defining the concept &quot;thing&quot;, namely:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) things (or: what is) are information (similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to Pythagoras: things are numbers)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) there are some things that are informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(particularly: that exist as 'digital' information)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) we can look at things (including nature)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the point of view of information (i.e. of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informational processes) but this does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imply that they are only information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I cannot state that I agree, nor that I disagree with you as I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no knowledge about what you mean by talking about &quot;things&quot;. Of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course, as a sensual experience I know what a &quot;thing&quot; is if I run 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into a thing. As a child, I have learnt to avoid hitting things or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being hit by things. But I believe you mean a concept of &quot;thing&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is more sophisticated than what a child learns to call a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;thing&quot;. In fact, once we agree about what is a &quot;thing&quot;, then we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shall have solved all our deep problems, then only calibrational, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technical questions remain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me propose a very technical approach to what we may call a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;thing&quot;. This central concept involves every other concept also, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because it can only be explained in the tension between &quot;now&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(&quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot;); &quot;is&quot; as opposed to &quot;could also have been&quot;; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;such&quot; as opposed to &quot;any kind of properties&quot;. In order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand the concept of a thing, one has to concentrate at the way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one looks at concepts generally:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do I regard cross-sectional states or do I regard processes? (this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is &quot;now&quot; against &quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do I look at that what remains or do I look at that what has been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accounted for, has been accomodated, has obeyed the rules (this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the approach of &quot;is&quot; as opposed to &quot;could have been&quot;)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do I look at the specifics of the remaining, unexplained, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;momentarily existing collection of logical statements, or do I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deduct their properties from that what they are not (this is &quot;such&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as opposed to &quot;any kind of properties&quot;)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To summarise:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- talking in logical sentences that have exact meaning one talks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about relations of concepts to each other: this means using numbers;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- considering whether I talk about a collection (&quot;cross-section&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;now&quot;) or about a sequence, I discover that I can say differing many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical sentences;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- matching the sentences that describe as well a process and as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well a state (the momentary state and the next step in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one-and-the-same sentence) I shall find some sentences that remain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unexplained (the moment contains more material than the past or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future); then I know what I shall term the &quot;thing&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This may appear useless gibberish but I assure you that it can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;translated into very solid number theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If there are things in the world, then we should be able to talk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about them in a precise way. Like &quot;harmony&quot; was a subjective, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sensual concept until Pythagoras made his lyra, like &quot;the golden 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cut&quot; was a subjective, aesthetic experience until they figured out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the proportions a:b=b:(a+b), like &quot;my position in my boat in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;midst of the endless ocean&quot; was a subejctive, anxiety-filled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience until they figured out astronomy and eventually satellite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;positioning. This year, the concept of &quot;thing that is energy and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material and place and forces and information&quot; is a complicated and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjective mixture of impressions, emotions and concepts, until they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have figured out the relation between logical sentences referring to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures and sequences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In genetics we see that a sequence (the DNA) rules a mixture (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;living cell). Obviously, there is an interaction between what is now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and what is later, between what is later and what shall become now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How many descriptive sentences can you make about a collection that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is now (as a concurrently present collection) as opposed to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collection that comes one-after-the-next? There, this little riddle 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has many serious implications...

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Karl,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what we are discussing now (concerning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the physical/biological/psychical...) status
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of information are less theological and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more ontological or metaphysical questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The question of being underlies this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion, for better for worse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course it is possible to say: everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is, is information (as we can say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything that is, is matter or whatever).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This can be understood in several ways:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) things (or: what is) are information (similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to Pythagoras: things are numbers)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) there are some things that are informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(particularly: that exist as 'digital' information)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) we can look at things (including nature)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the point of view of information (i.e. of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informational processes) but this does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imply that they are only information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first thesis is a metaphysical one, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;second should be considered within a broader
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ontology, the third implies that we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;project reality within the horizon of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abut also within the horizon of matter etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we understand by information a process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of selection out of a message (which is indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also the terminology used by Shannon) then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we can say that we are already involved in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;natural information process (the theological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question being then how it is possible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;send a message to 'nothing' i.e. a message
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that 'creates' and not simply 'informs' the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;receiver...). Of course the concept of message
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(implying a sender, a receiver, a structure to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be 'interpreted'/selected and... an address!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is basic. The complexity of human messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is indeed of different kind (but not simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opposed or even contradictory...) to the complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of, say, a DNA-messenger or of a quantum state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I am trying to say is that the (modern)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradigm of message communication (underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in different ways the concept(s) of information)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is (seems to me) basic for our scientific view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of nature and society and... it seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;highly productive too, independently of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ontological/metaphysical (and theological)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is this somehow acceptable for further discussion?
