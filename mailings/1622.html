<p>
Dear Loet and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the lucid and thoughtful message, Loet. Im sure youre right 
<br />
that the word science is often used for a wide range of meanings. I 
<br />
think that broad range can sometimes cause confusion rather than 
<br />
enlightenment, and may even include contradictory interpretations. Ive 
<br />
used the word to mean the pursuit of understanding by that method 
<br />
usually called the scientific method. My meaning would distinguish the 
<br />
humanities, including philosophy, art, mathematics and theology, for 
<br />
example, from science, and corresponds, roughly, with the separation 
<br />
described by C. P. Snow in his notable book, The Two Cultures.
<br />
<p>I would only categorize those disciplines as truly scientific which 
<br />
strictly adhere to the methodology of science. The renowned philosopher 
<br />
of science, Karl Popper, I believe, has described those methods most 
<br />
clearly and persuasively. His theory of falsification, refined by Quine 
<br />
and others, refurbishes and explicates the tenets of the scientific 
<br />
method portrayed first by Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century and 
<br />
Francis Bacon in the seventeenth. (And they go well with eggs and toast.)
<br />
<p>Popper explained that his falsification, or refutation, principle 
<br />
supplanted logical induction as the criterion for a valid scientific 
<br />
assertion. That assertion must, in principle, be subject to an 
<br />
observation or physical experiment capable of refuting that prediction. 
<br />
I believe this is the essence of truly scientific investigation, and is 
<br />
the source of its efficacy, its validity and authority, and of the 
<br />
progressive nature of genuine science. In my view, we ought label 
<br />
something science, and accord it the credence and respect of scientific 
<br />
conclusions, only to the extent that it adheres to the scientific method.
<br />
<p>Its my understanding, Loet, that the Vienna Circle encompassed 
<br />
philosophers of science, Carnap, Feigel, Philip Frank, possibly Quine, 
<br />
but few, if any, natural scientists, and that they are credited with an 
<br />
analytic philosophy which advocates clear, precise statements, and 
<br />
logical rigor and evidence, rather than ambiguity, in argumentation. If 
<br />
thats all there is to it, I count myself as such an advocate. In my 
<br />
judgment, equivocation and imprecise dilation (though easy to do) is a 
<br />
hindrance, and no help, toward understanding scientific arguments, or 
<br />
philosophic ones.
<br />
<p>Id like to emphasize that the laws of those scientific disciplines 
<br />
which strictly depend on observational validation are exclusively 
<br />
progressive, historically. There is no need to reconstruct scientific 
<br />
laws established observationally, since they are just as true today 
<br />
(within the range of their applicability) as when originally deduced. 
<br />
Though some religious doctrines, and the dictates of powerful notables, 
<br />
may have altered dramatically since Galilleos time, for example, we 
<br />
continue to recognize that the earth does not center our universe.
<br />
<p>The threat of torture to Galilleo, or just the pressure for compliance 
<br />
with our peers, or the craving for personal promotion, cannot alter 
<br />
scientific conclusions which are observationally founded. And which 
<br />
contrast, so often and so obviously, with self-serving speculation. 
<br />
Moreover, it appears that the awesome onslaught of modern technology 
<br />
(for good, and bad) flows from that reality which only observation imparts.
<br />
<p>I do recognize that many contemporary philosophers of science, including 
<br />
Kuhn, point to a different explanation of the historical progression 
<br />
which characterizes the observational sciences. But I can make (some 
<br />
other time) a powerful and persuasive case, I believe, that it is the 
<br />
universality and legitimacy of observation, and not popular acceptance 
<br />
by any group, if, even a group of influential scientists, which 
<br />
validates the conclusions of natural science.
<br />
<p>I appreciate your explanation for the use of a mathematical theory of 
<br />
communication to study flow of currency and other tokens of value, Loet. 
<br />
I wish I knew more. I find it fascinating and valuable.
<br />
<p>Cordially,
<br />
<p>Michael Devereux
