<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This brief remark concerns only the nature of the notion of &quot;fitness.&quot;
</em><br />
I would be reluctant to accept the notion of fitness at face value.
<br />
This reluctance stems from the long standing issues in population
<br />
genetics.
<br />
The fundamental issues are the sources of causality with respect to
<br />
&quot;fitness&quot;.  The logical entanglement of the external processes with the
<br />
internal processes and the capability of organisms to modify both the
<br />
external as well as the internal processes suggests that no simple
<br />
calculation of fitness is possible.&lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
I agree on these difficulties. There are constant changes going on by how
<br />
the selection of the &quot;fittest&quot; occurs. One (main?) reason (worked out on my
<br />
fis96 vienna paper), is the  collective use of (casual) fluctuations
<br />
ocurring internally and externally (system and environment). Such
<br />
fluctuations which change the &quot;traditional&quot; (a priori) distribuition of
<br />
sequenced symbols appear as &quot;errors&quot; in the transription of the information
<br />
code and may lead to changes in the behaviour of a system.
<br />
This is valid for biological genes as for social habits and values. Both,
<br />
genoma and cultural knowledge allow the reproduction of information
<br />
structures.
<br />
But not every &quot;error&quot; leads to a transformation. The modified element may
<br />
be uncapable to replicate in a certain environment or its devellopment may
<br />
be repressed by control functions.
<br />
Even so the system is constantly put in question by the possibility of
<br />
emergence of &quot;fitter&quot; elements. This is particularly true for systems whose
<br />
(self-)organisation occurs far from social equilibrium, where information
<br />
is unsufficient to cover uncertainty.
<br />
Therefore, selection and evolution are influenced by the collective
<br />
utilisation of casual fluctuations in the information code.
<br />
Now: even in a rapidly changing (social) system,  casual fluctuations which
<br />
establish a notable difference in the course (trajectory) of a single
<br />
system are extremely rare. To be noticed at all and make an effect, there
<br />
has to be a huge &quot;information-space&quot; controlled through a long time by a
<br />
collectivity of observers, cooperating somehow in networks. The use of
<br />
fluctuations  to influence the course of a transformation process is a
<br />
social or collective fenomena, to which great quantities, masses, with a
<br />
variety of different qualities have to give their contribute.
<br />
Collective entities are able to amplify the use of information throug
<br />
farther formation of even more collectivities. Only for the big numbers
<br />
there exist stable states that allow an if-then-behaviour to &quot;select the
<br />
fittest&quot; to &quot;survive&quot;.
<br />
Survival means a fact which is measurable in relative population numbers.
<br />
Its not just the quantity (the  more, the better). There is a certain
<br />
(upper and lower) limit of how many individuals and what kind of
<br />
information-tecniques does a culture need to be able to produce its own
<br />
self-comprehension and be &quot;fit&quot; for evolution.
<br />
So, &quot;fittest&quot; is determined by a value function, which is based on dynamic
<br />
parameters, (relatively)  independent from the population number.
<br />
This value has to do with &quot;functionality&quot;, with the information tecniques
<br />
mentioned. The element is evaluated by its working-capacity: is it able to
<br />
use the existing information to reproduce itself and the collectivity it
<br />
belongs? And how good does it work in comparision with the others?
<br />
This optimation (fit, fitter, fittest) occurs by selection of certain
<br />
functions within a network of cooperation and reaction, whose work and
<br />
division of labour is maintained and mediated by information processes.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;While the concept of fitness served some useful purposes several decades
</em><br />
ago, I believe that the term has been made obsolete by recent advances
<br />
in biological dynamics.&lt;
<br />
<p>Do you think ists completely obsolete, even when interpreted
<br />
&quot;qualitatively&quot;, as I tried above?
<br />
