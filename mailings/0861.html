Pedro--
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Personally I find that the discussion on 'info' differences between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;living and nonliving matter has been quite profound. Also, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;relationships between information and entropy (either thermodynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;or Shannonian) have resisted clarification, although some new ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to ponder have been presented. Very intriguingly, the theme of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;molecular recognition, followed by abduction, has somehow produced a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;collective convergence --the hunch that going both backwards and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;forwards a substantial part of the info puzzle may get an improved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ordering. Then, the interdisciplinary problem (or its absence within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;our present system of sciences) has not received much attention; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the socioinfo realm (including the exchanges on power laws and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;little bit of economics) has shown some promise of finding an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;interesting development from FIS perspectives. In spite of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;individual attempts, we have not meaningfully connected with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;contemporary problems (sustainable development, world crisis) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;who knows...
</em><br />
<p>This is a great list. Perhaps the discussion on the necessity of sign 
<br />
should also be included. What you have listed are where the 
<br />
discussion has indicated non-convergence, but I suspect that the 
<br />
actual nubs behind the differing opinions can be discovered and 
<br />
exposed --the different &quot;religious issues&quot; if you will.
<br />
<p>I have found the virtual conference very much more useful than, say, 
<br />
the physical one in Vienna because the virtual intercourse has 
<br />
exposed some &quot;first principles&quot; to have more utility than I had 
<br />
previously allowed. The e-conference is a self-organizing system in 
<br />
itself, with interaction of abstractions for recognition and 
<br />
dominance. For instance, I previously saw investigations of &quot;signing 
<br />
systems&quot; in emergent chemical behavior as a dead end. I preferred the 
<br />
abstractions humans use to deal with molecules rather than working 
<br />
seriously with the abstractions that molecules themselves use. I'm 
<br />
now convinced otherwise -- not sure I have the tools to make 
<br />
something of this insight, but to do so a research team would have to 
<br />
choose among the various philosophies espoused here.
<br />
<p>An example is the category theory issue versus set theory as the 
<br />
basis for the abstraction. It seems you MUST prefer one, and the 
<br />
question is of which strikes very deep into the issue of whether 
<br />
meaning or effect follows or bears any relationship at all to 
<br />
recognition.
<br />
<p>Pedro, your job is to be polite and inclusive, so you tend to skirt 
<br />
these issues. But isn't there value in digging deeper and at least 
<br />
trying to clarify the basic differences in approach? It might help 
<br />
our self-organization.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;My opinion is that we are 'in the dark' yet. All the formal tools
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;presented so far have weak and strong aspects... Rather than relying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on a single approach, I am inclined to follow a syncretistic vision.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;For instance, the overall qualitative conceptualization from Karl,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the physical from Juan and Andrei, the entropy from Shu-Kun, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;communication in living cells from Jerry and Cristophe, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;self-referential from Terry, the symbolic from John H., the social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;info 'mechanics' from Ted and Wolfgang, the causality and optimality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;from John C.... but obviously this 'soccer team' is quite arbitrary.
</em><br />
<p>If we were putting together a research lab for this work, we¼d need 
<br />
to make some basic decisions (quite independently of personalities) 
<br />
about:
<br />
<p>--the mix of disciplines,
<br />
<p>--some application domain in which the science can be tested (and 
<br />
presumably be useful), and
<br />
<p>--some essential leverageable principles, including some commitments 
<br />
as noted above.
<br />
<p>I take your notion of a soccer team to address the first bullet more 
<br />
than the third.
<br />
<p>As to the second, I believe your preference for the application 
<br />
domain is in social and economic systems which will then provide a 
<br />
new &quot;economics&quot; for molecular organization. This is the other way 
<br />
around from many represented here.
