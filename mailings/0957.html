<p>
65 years ago 19 March 1938. Mexico officially protested against the 
<br />
invasion of Austria by the German (Nazi) army. The President  of 
<br />
MÈxico L·zaro C·rdenas gave to Mexican Ambassador Isidro Fabela the 
<br />
instructions for presenting the protest to the League of Nations 
<br />
(Geneva, Switzerland).
<br />
<p>MÈxico was the only country that officially protested in the League 
<br />
of Nations when the Nazi troops marched into Austria. It was 
<br />
announced as the Anschluﬂ (union of two countries), but for L·zaro 
<br />
Cardenas  was an international aggression because Austrian government 
<br />
had not agreed in advance. Though Austrian people were not bombed 
<br />
neither indiscriminately killed, it was the first action towards  the 
<br />
Second World War (1939-1945) which caused the death of millions of 
<br />
people and culminated with the massive extermination of innocent 
<br />
people  when the new US president Harry Truman  authorized the use of 
<br />
the new developed atomic bomb on Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and 
<br />
Nagasaki (August 9, 1945)
<br />
<p>In 1938 governments used to make bilateral agreements with other 
<br />
countries for cooperation among them or against other countries; or 
<br />
simply to make warfare in accordance with their appreciations, which 
<br />
were justified only in the view of the aggressor(s). In the following 
<br />
years first Pacts for no Aggression for delaying the intended 
<br />
invasion and later the constitution of the Grand Alliance (Britain, 
<br />
the USSR and the United States) were the international means employed 
<br />
for defeating the aggressors and  defending the countries and people 
<br />
arbitrarily invaded.
<br />
<p>Since October 1945 the presence and efforts of UNO have not been 
<br />
enough for changing the sanguinary course that characterizes until 
<br />
today the magnificence of our homosphere, though in several cases it 
<br />
played a significant role in dealing with cease-fire actions of 
<br />
warfare between countries and among  factions and the withdrawal of 
<br />
armies from territories invaded.
<br />
<p>In 2003 the UNO's purposes and means became useless for impeding  the 
<br />
preemptive war organized by some governments of developed - highly 
<br />
civilized - countries against innocent people. 
<br />
<p>This war show clearly how the high society of some powerful countries 
<br />
are still planning and acting to use violent procedures in order to 
<br />
continue taking unilaterally the terrestrial resources located 
<br />
anywhere and to annihilate massively the common people
<br />
<p>What is scandalous and also frightening for the perspective of 
<br />
humankind is the degradation of human values not only in those brains 
<br />
that organized this war but also in those corrupted minds of 
<br />
governments that accepted to be accomplices, ignoring that this is an 
<br />
abhorrent war because
<br />
<p>It is IMMORAL: to ignore absolutely the need of dealing first with 
<br />
problems of poverty, injustice, unemployment, shelter and disease 
<br />
that are growing all over the world  giving priority instead to push 
<br />
ahead the war industry and to control oil resources of Iraq in order 
<br />
to overcome the recession of American economy, which has been 
<br />
produced by fallacious and wrong policies of American government and 
<br />
corporations.
<br />
<p>It is also IMMORAL even from a MILITARY point of view: to seek the 
<br />
involvement of United Nations Organization to ensure the disarmament 
<br />
of Irak before attacking Iraq's people. It is perhaps the first case 
<br />
when it is successfully required - through UNO - the enemy to lay 
<br />
down their weapons before a battle.
<br />
<p>It is UNREASONABLE: to kill indiscriminately people of Iraq in order 
<br />
to assure a quick victory  without recognizing that it will increase 
<br />
feelings of revenge that will affect innocent American people 
<br />
everywhere;
<br />
<p>to cause the destruction of Iraq infrastructure by means of expensive 
<br />
weapons in order to rebuilt this infrastructure afterwards;
<br />
<p>to assume and claim that Iraq possess an arsenal of weapons for 
<br />
massive annihilation while ignoring that  other countries, comprise 
<br />
the same USA, have really a huge arsenal each one.
<br />
<p>It is ILLEGAL: to disregard the Resolution 1441, which does not 
<br />
authorize war against Iraq;
<br />
<p>to put aside the reports presented by UN Weapons Inspector Hans Blix 
<br />
of increased cooperation and disarmament by Iraq;
<br />
<p>to proceed to war in case another proposal of USA and UK is rejected 
<br />
by the Security Council either because it had not enough votes or it 
<br />
is vetoed,  as it will be a violation of the United Nations Charter 
<br />
and Article VI(2) of the United States Constitution;
<br />
<p>to exercise the rule of military force for and a quick defeat by 
<br />
means of  massive annihilation over the presence of international law.
<br />
<p>It is INHUMANE: to act on the name of one God that appears as being 
<br />
interested in using the USA army and weapons for killing people that 
<br />
use to pray another God. It is even argued that the American God is 
<br />
already organizing the announced Apocalypse;
<br />
<p>to announce that USA government will provide the necessary help to 
<br />
those Muslims who might manage to survive after being liberated no 
<br />
matter whether they could be traumatized, maimed, burnt, blinded, 
<br />
incurably affected by toxics, suffering from the radioactive effects 
<br />
of depleted uraniums shells that will empower some of them to pass 
<br />
genetic abhorrent defects on to their children
<br />
<p>It is ANTIDEMOCRATIC: to ignore Arab cultural values in order to 
<br />
introduce the American democracy no matter the protests of American 
<br />
citizens against the war had been dismissed;
<br />
<p>to ignore the voices in protest to war expressed in huge 
<br />
manifestations  all over the world;
<br />
<p>to argue that those governments that are against the war should be 
<br />
considered as enemies of USA.
<br />
<p>It is publicly PERVERTED: to tell the members of the Security Council 
<br />
that in case they might not support the War against Irak their 
<br />
countries risk of being denied in the future further aid (financial, 
<br />
monetary or material) from USA because quite probably it won't be 
<br />
approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate. In this way 
<br />
it is cynically recognized de facto that the American aid is a bribe.
<br />
<p><p>UNO was constituted with ideas that emerged during the sanguinary 
<br />
confrontation of the Alliance constituted by Britain, the USSR and 
<br />
the United States against the German-Italian-Japanese Axis while 
<br />
recognizing the need to replace the ill-fated League of Nations.
<br />
<p>Would and could UNO be reinforced now as the organization engaged in 
<br />
improving and updating the international legislation that is needed 
<br />
for assuring the humanitarian globalization of human concerns whose 
<br />
cultural diversity is indispensable for helping human entities and 
<br />
individuals to behave humanely and play a responsible role on our 
<br />
unique Earth (the only planet available for human life) ?
<br />
<p>How could humankind survive in the near future if their 
<br />
representatives in UNO,  were unable to impede this war against 
<br />
innocent people ?
<br />
<p>How could common people encourage at least seven U.N. Ambassadors for invoking
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Resolution &quot;Uniting for Peace&quot; #377 in order to call URGENTLY 
<br />
the General Assembly of UNO?
<br />
<p>The General Assembly of UNO must find out immediately:
<br />
<p>*  how to condemn those countries who participate in this war;
<br />
<p>*  how to stop the war that has already started;
<br />
<p>*  how to stop completely the scientific and technological production 
<br />
of massive weapons in the highly civilized countries.
<br />
<p>In case the General Assembly considered necessary to replace the 
<br />
ill-fated UNO by a more reliable organization it will be another 
<br />
clear evidence that humankind is condemned to disappear pretty soon.
