The contributions, each in his way, encourage systemic thinking. The best 
<br />
thread, for me, to demonstrate on what number theory can contribute to this 
<br />
discussion, is to comment on Aleks Jakulin's text. As Aleks writes anyway in a 
<br />
very broad perspective, I hope other contributions feel also mirrored.
<br />
<p>Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's focus on the level of a (possibly compound) system, composed of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components, which are themselves composed from molecules. 
</em><br />
We discuss a set composed of subsets, which are themselves composed from units 
<br />
we consider for purposes of this discussion to be the unit.
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be sub-corporate entities that cut in the intermediate space between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the corporation as a whole and an individual employee.
</em><br />
The perspective of our investigations is focused on subsets - as opposed to the 
<br />
whole of the set and to the individual unit.
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So evolution takes place at many levels. The key realization is that one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level sits on top of other levels.
</em><br />
The set includes subsets. Subsets can also include smaller subsets.
<br />
<p>Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You cannot survive under an x-ray 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine because your cells are dependent on stable molecules and atoms. 
</em><br />
An over-determination of places of parts of an assembly (e.g. by synchronising 
<br />
their movements due to the effects of a radiation) is not conductive for 
<br />
biologic processes.
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A culture that consumes its people in wars, or expends its best people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without letting them reproduce (e.g., through an overextended education 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that interferes with reproduction), is a dying one.
</em><br />
The quality of a set as described in a temporal cross-section (in this moment 
<br />
there are x people in reproductive age, y people are not available for 
<br />
reproduction, z people have sufficient circumstances to reproduce, etc.) has an 
<br />
intimate (according to some, causal, logical) relation with the probability 
<br />
spread re prediction about the set's future state (if it is so now, then it is 
<br />
probable to a% that it shall be in state k in time t from now, to b% that it 
<br />
shall be in state w in time t from now, etc.)
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was merely trying to concoct a physicalist theory of meaning in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Stan's hierarchies: the higher level is the 'meaning' of the lower
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, and the lower level is the 'fact' to a higher level.
</em><br />
The description of the set in terms of its subsets will always have an 
<br />
arbitrary touch in it, if there are several &quot;layers&quot; of subsets. Specifically 
<br />
so, if the segmentation of the set into subsets happens several times 
<br />
concurrently. Given some properties of a subset, its included subsets have also 
<br />
some predictable properties. The properties of subsets of a subset depend 
<br />
heavily on the properties of the mother subset. 
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This way one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoids the recursive self-referential loop (What is A to A? What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling of feeling cold? What is the meaning of meaning?), 
</em><br />
There are two languages which describe a set: one details the proportions of 
<br />
subsets among each other, the other details the properties of individuals. They 
<br />
are of course cross-referencing each other (the more specific properties 
<br />
subsets have, the more individualised are the objects each.) The meaning of a 
<br />
fact is its description in the other language. (Cold is that electrical pattern 
<br />
which accompanies this bunch of  biochemical properties. Understanding is that 
<br />
bunch of biochemical properties which accompanies the reproduction of some 
<br />
electrical patterns which were predictable and predicted.)
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, the thinking is not complete and perfect,
</em><br />
As thinking it is complete and perfect. As a part of a to-and-fro, of 
<br />
predictably stable bijective relations between feeling and thinking, (between 
<br />
the representation of a &lt;thing&gt; as a biochemical mixture and the representation 
<br />
of the same &lt;thing&gt; as an electrical discharge pattern, that is, congruent 
<br />
relations between commutative and sequential arrangements of the arguments of a 
<br />
logical sentence referring to the same logical entity), it is not complete and 
<br />
perfect.
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but if one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepts that thinking is essentially a web of constructs,
</em><br />
thereby we accept the Wittgenstein set of logical relations
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can discuss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different theories of meaning: all of them are oversimplified, but some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we might like better than the others.
</em><br />
The theory of meaning being presently arrived at in this very FIS jam 
<br />
session/workshop does not strike me as being oversimplified.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The social system has developed, for example, a juridical system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which tries to prevent people from perishing when they are weak. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dynamics of philosophies (&quot;your philosophy will perish&quot;) are in important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ways different from the dynamics at the level of species. These 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the dynamics provide us with room for generating a knowledge-based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; economy. Scientific knowledge is often based on counter-factuals and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counter-intuitive by nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that the dynamics is different, but still I find it similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough so that the same explanatory metaphors can be used. I have seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my share of technologies and methodologies that have perished, a great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many of dead ends. And there too are means of protecting and saving the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weak, like the web archive [<a href="../../www.archive.org/default.htm">http://www.archive.org</a>], and various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sanctuaries for old software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [<a href="../../www.woundedmoon.org/win32_freeware.html">http://www.woundedmoon.org/win32_freeware.html</a>] and old computer games
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [<a href="../../www.the-underdogs.org/default.htm">http://www.the-underdogs.org/</a>]. Nevertheless, a lot unnamed things have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perished, and I'm sure this is the case of philosophy as well. Beware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the trap: if you can remember it, it hasn't perished yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thus, the natural (&quot;biological&quot;) order of things is a dangerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument at the level of society because one risks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; throw away the child with the bathing water (i.e., culture).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The differences between &quot;biological&quot; evolution and cultural evolution are to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be celebrated if we wish to understand how a knowledge-based subdynamics can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counteract upon the &quot;natural&quot; order of things.
</em><br />
The concept of evolution is the counterconcept to entropy. What one considers 
<br />
natural, is culturally dependent. In number theory, the natural numbers are the 
<br />
most natural we can get. They do have, naturally, natural properties, and this 
<br />
is what number theory sings and dances about. There are very natural densities, 
<br />
agglomerations, probabilities which allow simulating evolution. May we 
<br />
respectfully offer the properties of natural numbers to find common ground in 
<br />
the discussion of how properties of systems and sub-systems evolve? Let us use 
<br />
mathematics to help to figure out what the normal flow of matters is.   
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I write &quot;biological&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deliberately between quotation marks because the biological sciences are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; part and parcel of this culture.
</em><br />
Which culture? The culture at the cafeteria of a TU and of that of a psychology 
<br />
institute are quite different. The belief in the predictability of reality sets 
<br />
the two populations apart. 
<br />
Aleks: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Agreed. But naturalistic approaches do speak of co-evolution between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; culture and population, so the workers in the area are well aware of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. The devices, however, are at a lower level,
</em><br />
Newton has f...d up the philosophy of science by saying it remains idle or 
<br />
keeps rolling. This excludes all that breathes and eats and reproduces. Since 
<br />
then, biology has been treated offside or in cabaretistic ways (occult 
<br />
calculations, planetary biorhythms, etc.). There is much basic re-education 
<br />
necessary to make absolvents of TUs understand the way one counts in 
<br />
psychology. It is not the devices which are at a low level. Often it is the 
<br />
ability of the researcher to look thru the microscope /having persuaded himself 
<br />
that there might be something worth looking at/ and to recognise the 
<br />
extraordinary that is to be encouraged, rather than the engineering of the 
<br />
microscope. 
<br />
Aleks: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's the same as the interface between chemistry and biology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or between psychology and sociology.
</em><br />
The contrast can be emphasised by biology vs. mechanics. The basic axioms re 
<br />
&quot;stable state&quot;, &quot;predictable state&quot; are quite different.
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While chemistry and biology, psychology and sociology peacefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coexist, humanists and naturalists keep throwing insults at one another.
</em><br />
They speak in different grammars: one in a sequential grid (the Wittgenstein 
<br />
set), the other in distance-torsion-structures (what Wittgenstein says is 
<br />
outside his set). This frustrates.
<br />
Aleks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Most naturalists don't take the time to understand philosophy and just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ridicule it and dismiss it in their naive overconfidence; most humanists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fear the one-sided uninformed brashness of naturalists, and then employ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scare tactics. I guess the problem is in the competition between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and between sociology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolutionary psychology. With the escalated temper at both sides, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is rarely an opportunity to exchange ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aleks
</em><br />
All the better that there is FIS.
