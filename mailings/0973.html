OUR CURRENT NUCLEAR WAR
<br />
C. A. Hilgartner, MD
<br />
<p>The issues in the proposed &quot;preemptive&quot; strike against Iraq go beyond 
<br />
making the United States the aggressors; beyond violating 
<br />
international law, the UN Charter, the Nuremberg Decisions, the US 
<br />
Constitution and Bill of Rights, etc. They even go beyond committing 
<br />
genocide against the Iraqi people.
<br />
<p>In order to understand what I say, look up &quot;depleted uranium&quot; on a 
<br />
search engine.
<br />
<p>I offer my comments in outline form, as briefly as possible.
<br />
<p>0.	Natural uranium occurs in several isotopes, including a 
<br />
fissionable isotope, symbolized as U-235, which we could in principle 
<br />
use to make nuclear &quot;devices&quot;, nuclear power plants, etc.; and the 
<br />
most common isotope, U-238, which will not undergo nuclear fission. 
<br />
&quot;Depleted&quot; uranium means that some part of the military-industrial 
<br />
complex has already extracted the fissionable isotope of uranium -- 
<br />
symbolized as U-235 -- leaving behind the 99.3% of the original 
<br />
sample, which consists mainly of U-238. The weapons with which we 
<br />
have armed our military forces use depleted uranium projectiles, a 
<br />
coating of depleted uranium on the bombs which our Air Force 
<br />
personnel will drop, etc.
<br />
<p>1.	Uranium has a very high density -- 1.8 times that of lead. 
<br />
Projectiles or missiles containing depleted uranium have such a high 
<br />
momentum that they penetrate standard steel armor, etc., &quot;like 
<br />
butter.&quot; When they strike an obstacle, the uranium shatters into fine 
<br />
particles, about 70% of which then spontaneously burn, in the oxygen 
<br />
of the atmosphere, into uranium oxide smoke - forming aerosol 
<br />
particles, less than 5 microns in diameter. Organisms -- human or 
<br />
non-human -- exposed to particles of this size will breathe them in 
<br />
and retain at least some of them, get them into any wounds they may 
<br />
have, etc..
<br />
<p>2.	Uranium, like lead, cadmium, arsenic, etc., functions as a 
<br />
poison if it gets inside a living organism.
<br />
<p>3.	Uranium spontaneously undergoes radioactive decay, emitting 
<br />
two kinds of ionizing radiation: alpha particles (helium nuclei, 
<br />
traveling at very high velocities -- very heavy, very harmful, but 
<br />
not able to penetrate very far) and gamma rays (like super-energetic 
<br />
X-rays -- very harmful, and able to penetrate).
<br />
<p>4.	A sample of uranium (U-238) has a half-life of almost 4.5 
<br />
BILLION years. Since the era in which the sun and all the different 
<br />
planets formed, approximately half of the entire quantity of U-238 in 
<br />
our solar system has by now decayed. It will take that long for half 
<br />
of the remainder to decay.
<br />
<p>5.	Ionizing radiation damages any living organism which it 
<br />
strikes. All known kinds of living organisms make and use DNA to 
<br />
store, preserve and reproduce the kind of information needed to grow 
<br />
and maintain that kind of living organism. DNA specifically absorbs 
<br />
ionizing radiation, getting damaged or destroyed when it does so. 
<br />
Ionizing radiation does other kinds of harm to living organisms, less 
<br />
well understood. Any organism with blood capillaries -- the kind of 
<br />
circulatory system we humans have -- proves particularly vulnerable 
<br />
to ionizing radiation. A whole-body dose of something like 500 
<br />
roentgen units suffices to kill at least half of a population of 
<br />
humans. Having a source of ionizing radiation INSIDE of a living 
<br />
organism proves particularly harmful. And a chemically toxic source 
<br />
of radiation proves even more harmful.
<br />
<p>6.	Back at the height of the Cold War, some Americans began 
<br />
speculating about what would happen if a Malevolent Enemy should 
<br />
release a few grams, or pounds, of some finely-divided radioactive 
<br />
isotope upwind of some American population center. The consequences 
<br />
they envisioned seemed horrifying -- and predictably accurate in 
<br />
terms of what scientists know about the effects of ionizing radiation 
<br />
on living organisms.
<br />
<p>In the course of the first Gulf War, our forces bombarded the people, 
<br />
non-human organisms and terrain of Iraq with something on the order 
<br />
of 312 tons of depleted uranium -- approximately 624,000 pounds of 
<br />
uranium, about 436,000 pounds of it in the form of aerosol particles 
<br />
-- finely-divided uranium oxide. These particles will travel long 
<br />
distances when airborne.
<br />
<p>If the US government would permit anyone to go into Iraq and measure 
<br />
radioactive contamination of the terrain in various places, I surmise 
<br />
that they might find that at least parts of Iraq got so heavily 
<br />
contaminated with uranium as to render them uninhabitable.
<br />
<p>I invite you to go on the internet and find some of the reports of 
<br />
the plight of the civilians  -- the men, women and children -- of 
<br />
Iraq today. I predict that you will find accounts of radiation 
<br />
sickness, uranium toxicity, leukemias and cancers, birth defects, 
<br />
grossly deformed babies, stillborns, etc., etc. (*)
<br />
<p>After the first Gulf war, some of our returning soldiers experienced 
<br />
ill-defined symptoms which got labeled &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;. As I 
<br />
understand it, these veterans received no information at all about 
<br />
the possibility that they may have gotten exposed to ionizing 
<br />
radiation, including internal particles of uranium, both from 
<br />
handling the weapons issued to them as well as from the uranium they 
<br />
distributed by using those weapons. As I understand it, they found 
<br />
great difficulty getting any medical attention at all, from the VA 
<br />
Hospital system, and perhaps, elsewhere.
<br />
<p>The US. Veterans Administration prepared a report on a state-wide 
<br />
survey of the reproductive health of 251 families of Gulf War 
<br />
veterans living in Mississippi. The report deals with their children 
<br />
conceived and born since the war. They found that sixty-seven percent 
<br />
of the babies born had severe eye defects or no eyes and ears - along 
<br />
with susceptibility to infections, respiratory problems, etc.
<br />
<p>7.	By now, anyone in the &quot;developed&quot; world who can field an army 
<br />
has supplied  their armed forces with uranium-tipped weapons. Any 
<br />
military unit that engages in maneuvers -- if they fire their 
<br />
depleted uranium weapons -- will leave that part of Earth's crust 
<br />
contaminated with fragments and colloidal particles of uranium.
<br />
<p>As I understand it, in order to provide any hope of withstanding the 
<br />
fire of an enemy armed with depleted uranium weapons, our weapons 
<br />
manufacturers have lined our tanks, and perhaps, other vehicles, with 
<br />
depleted uranium armor. Every time they enter and operate these 
<br />
vehicles, their crews climb into a radiation chamber. Anyone who 
<br />
manufactures, transports, handles or fires uranium-tipped or -lined 
<br />
weapons gets exposed to ionizing radiation. And every microgram of 
<br />
uranium used in a military campaign gets left there, to poison and 
<br />
irradiate any living organisms that wander by.
<br />
<p>8.	INFERENCE: Any warfare in which the combatants use depleted 
<br />
uranium weapons makes the planet less habitable. How much of that 
<br />
kind of insult will it take to make Planet Earth as uninhabitable as 
<br />
our Moon?
<br />
<p>No one knows for sure.
<br />
<p>And we can't find out -- make the required careful, and repeated, 
<br />
measurements -- without in the process sterilizing our planet. If the 
<br />
experiments leave any humans living, how would we know that we had in 
<br />
fact applied enough insult to make the planet uninhabitable?
<br />
<p>Of course, as Jonathan Schell pointed out in his book, The Fate of 
<br />
the Earth, under the conditions signified by the word extinction, the 
<br />
planet would harbor no humans to observe present conditions and 
<br />
generate a report, and no human to report to.
<br />
<p>9.	THE MAIN ISSUE in the &quot;To War Or Not To War&quot; debate: Do we 
<br />
DESIRE to sterilize our planet? Do we actually SEEK to produce 
<br />
species suicide and extinction of humans, and perhaps, pan-biocide -- 
<br />
the annihilation of the other kinds of living organisms also?
<br />
<p>In my opinion, the decision -- no matter who makes it -- the decision 
<br />
to GO to war risks sterilizing Planet Earth.

will have to DO to avert self-inflicted extinction.
