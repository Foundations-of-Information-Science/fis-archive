<p>
It seems advisable to start summarizing the reflection that I began 
<br />
to structure three weeks ago and even to imagine some preliminary 
<br />
conclusions. At present in one conventional year 2002, it Is indeed 
<br />
evident that some of our ancestors who were descendants from ancient 
<br />
primates could develop their gregariousness, by means of thoughts 
<br />
that they managed to transfer from one mind to several other brains 
<br />
using for such a purpose words which were gradually invented through 
<br />
the symbolic meaning assigned to some of the arbitrary noises that 
<br />
they could produce individually through his or her mouth. In fact and 
<br />
due to causes that will remain unknown forever it seems that they 
<br />
discovered first their possibilities to communicate and invented 
<br />
afterwards what became the linguistic tool that allowed every 
<br />
individual to give certain information of various aspects of the 
<br />
reality and to receive another information of the same or other 
<br />
aspects of the reality. It is the basic human communication - 
<br />
constituted by words complemented with other signs and symbols that 
<br />
can be basically expressed orally or visually and consequently may be 
<br />
perceived through ears and eyes - what presumably helped most of our 
<br />
first ancestors to survive individually through cooperation needed 
<br />
for making first of all better tools with their hands, while trying 
<br />
each one to identify and develop his or her personality through 
<br />
competition. It is the transfer of knowledge acquired of causal 
<br />
interactions that are determining the dynamical features of things 
<br />
and events located in the surroundings, which suddenly became in the 
<br />
human mind something that could be usefully employed.
<br />
<p>Consequently it can be argued that the development of language - 
<br />
which has taken place interactively with the development of 
<br />
capabilities for making tools needed for assuring the manifestation 
<br />
of a generalized utilitarianism - has caused the development of human 
<br />
features.
<br />
<p>Therefore I dare to assume that INFORMATION is nothing less and also 
<br />
nothing more than a CONCEPTUAL POTENTIALITY invented by the human 
<br />
mind and used as an INTELLECTUAL TOOL by every relatively normal 
<br />
person, who is trying continuously to assure the functionality of his 
<br />
or her mind, while searching how to organize his or her 
<br />
physiological, psychological, and social performance for improving 
<br />
his or her survival concern after realizing that he or she may 
<br />
increase his or her possibilities and develop better his or her 
<br />
capabilities and even overcome some limitations learning to 
<br />
comprehend the reality perceived through diverse perspectives.
<br />
<p>So far so good, but it is not proper to simply idealized the human 
<br />
nature. Today, while trying to comprehend:
<br />
<p>*	why the trajectory of the whole civilizing adventure has been 
<br />
always sanguinary;
<br />
<p>*	why its assumed evolvement has caused always the emergence of 
<br />
painful circumstances that generated tragical conditions in the 
<br />
living of the vast majority of people;
<br />
<p>*	why at the dawn of the conventional 3rd millennium of our age 
<br />
humankind is confronted to more and more and larger local, regional 
<br />
and global problems that altogether constitute the worst crisis ever 
<br />
faced by humankind, in spite of magnificent scientific achievements, 
<br />
superb technological devices and processes, very significant artistic 
<br />
realizations
<br />
<p>it has become indispensable to recognize explicitly that due to the 
<br />
way the civilizing adventure could emerged and has been evolving 
<br />
(along a very short lapse of ONLY 6 or 8 millennia compared with the 
<br />
many millennia of nomadic life that our ancestors needed for making 
<br />
possible, though unconsciously, the emergence of human features) the 
<br />
presence of humans in time and in space tends to be, almost 
<br />
inevitably, more and more a controversial contradiction. Such a 
<br />
conflict is a growing danger generated by the narrow minded and 
<br />
shortsighted course assigned and not only de facto to one powerful 
<br />
and compulsively implemented decision making that has always aimed at 
<br />
INVENTING CAUSAL INTERACTIONS that are presented as MODERN 
<br />
INFORMATION needed for maintaining the civilizing trends which have 
<br />
been always seriously inconsistent with the needs of most humans and 
<br />
dangerously incongruous with the dynamics of the biosphere.
<br />
<p>In fact it seems evident that this enormous inconvenience has been 
<br />
maintained from the very beginning (since around eight millennia ago) 
<br />
until today by some relatively few cleverer humans who have learnt 
<br />
quite effectively to produce INFORMATION for making possible a 
<br />
selfish evolvement of the personality of every one of them, who aims 
<br />
exclusively at taking unilateral advantage of utilitarian 
<br />
possibilities discovered in all those natural, man-made and human 
<br />
beings which are considered no more than objects or resources for the 
<br />
progress of HUMANKIND.
<br />
<p>The perspective for humankind during the last century has become 
<br />
increasingly risky first of all because the prevailing 
<br />
decision-making, which has aimed at maintaining the trends of the 
<br />
superb Western civilization, has caused everywhere the deterioration 
<br />
of essential features of the terrestrial environments. Some features 
<br />
of the Ecosphere have been also continuously disrupted. In addition, 
<br />
due to the explosive proliferation of humans (1 billion in 1830, 2 
<br />
billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, 6 billion in 2000) it cannot 
<br />
longer be ignored that the planetary resources for the subsistence of 
<br />
more and more humans won't be available forever.
<br />
<p>The whole problem aggravates day after day because the causes of this 
<br />
crisis are ignored by most decision-makers who continue arguing that 
<br />
the only perspective for humankind is the Globalized Free Marketing 
<br />
supported by the automatized production managed by large corporations.
<br />
Will the scientific community recognize soon that  a Top Ë Down 
<br />
approach for recognizing holistically the whole crisis, as it was 
<br />
suggested by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the 1960s might lead 
<br />
researchers, experts, scholars and educators to conceive how to play 
<br />
a responsible role
<br />
<p>The 2nd millennium has finished rather recently, but the effects of 
<br />
the decision making that has been traditionally implemented will 
<br />
remain affecting the dynamics of civilizing intentions, UNLESS THE 
<br />
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY FINDS ON ITS OWN HOW TO PLAY A RESPONSIBLE ROLE 
<br />
ON THE PLANET ON BEHALF OF THE MASSES, CREATING THE NECESSARY 
<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE EMERGENCE OF DISSIDENTS in the sense that was 
<br />
suggested by Anatol Rapoport around 50 years ago: &quot;the scientist must 
<br />
subscribe to certain values (and discard others) not because he is a 
<br />
'good citizen' or a product of a [particular] culture or a member of 
<br />
a [particular] church, but because he is a scientist.&quot; &quot;The 
<br />
scientist, in order to be consistent with himself, cannot remain 
<br />
neutral, when confronted with a variety of competing ideologies and 
<br />
value-systems&quot;.
