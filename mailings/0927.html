<p>
A Theory of Information in the domain of the proposed Information 
<br />
Science would be by definition a certain set of general principles 
<br />
derived from one or another generalization of empirical knowledge 
<br />
acquired.
<br />
<p>Principles necessarily constituted with the intention of making 
<br />
coherent enough the application of all kinds of information to 
<br />
problematic circumstances or enigmatic situations that appear 
<br />
approachable enough for being solved by means of one or another 
<br />
peculiar information.
<br />
<p>This description of what this theory might be, though it could be 
<br />
considered obvious and even trivial, becomes enormously complicated 
<br />
after observing that it emerges as a puzzle whose solution will be 
<br />
impossible to agree in all those cases where it were assumed strictly 
<br />
necessary to CONSIDER INFORMATION any and every possible and real 
<br />
attachment, connection, coupling, junction, link, tie, union, 
<br />
fastening, alliance, association,... between two or among several of 
<br />
the distinguishable parts or factors of any natural or man-arranged 
<br />
(being comprised those inspired by divinities) phenomena.
<br />
<p>However, it can be assumed that this impossibility may become a 
<br />
possibility searching ways for making the puzzle potentially 
<br />
approachable through the gradual (due to numberless inherent 
<br />
difficulties) recognition of the need of searching what may 
<br />
constitute Unity through Diversity in the whole human concern.
<br />
<p>But this assumption is not a magical recipe nor even a formula for 
<br />
learning a feasible way of dealing with this huge problem because the 
<br />
pretended evolvement of every human concern has been and continue 
<br />
being prejudiced by narrow minded and twisted by shortsighted values 
<br />
systematically aggravated by serious disruptions and inconvenient 
<br />
deviations generated by the unconscious dynamics of the civilizing 
<br />
adventure.
<br />
<p>Due to the way our magnificent civilized homosphere has been created 
<br />
and built the pretended evolvement of most human concerns have been 
<br />
more and more infected by numerous forces invented and imposed for 
<br />
assuring the civilizing trends. These forces aim at making everything 
<br />
homogeneous, whatever might be the consequences for every suffering 
<br />
individuality.
<br />
<p>Alarming and even terrorizing examples of these homogenizing forces 
<br />
are the rules invented and systematically updated by every elitist 
<br />
decision making pretending to assure the functionality of every 
<br />
civilizing experience that could emerged during the last six 
<br />
millennia. Rules that inevitably caused every civilization to become 
<br />
an unsustainable experiment. In each case the blindness and deafness 
<br />
of the elites did not help at all to avoid the collapse of each 
<br />
experience.
<br />
<p>These are the rules that have determined the imposition of the 
<br />
unilateral utilitarianism of the labor of masses of people - human 
<br />
resources compulsively organized as MEGAMACHINES  (Mumford). The so 
<br />
called common people always had to proudly accept the role assigned 
<br />
to them because their efforts would assure continuously the way of 
<br />
life of the high civilized specimens of the human species - those who 
<br />
claim that are the representatives of humankind because they are 
<br />
cultivated and cultured humans.
<br />
<p>A second example is the empowerment of armies always constituted by 
<br />
well trained humans as admirably soldiers who behave as courageous 
<br />
warriors willing to be recognized as brave guards of their country 
<br />
against the menacing enemies and ready to kill individually or 
<br />
massively all the adversaries and even died when necessary as real 
<br />
patriots.
<br />
<p>The whole civilizing adventure has culminated in the grandiose MARKET 
<br />
purposefully constituted as engine for the evolvement of the Western 
<br />
civilization empowered by fallaciously democratic formulas, but so 
<br />
far efficient means for maintaining its functionality, while being 
<br />
disregarded its fragility. These are recipes continuously re-invented 
<br />
for allowing every individual that belong to the masses, medium 
<br />
classes and elites (six billion people and even more) to recognize 
<br />
his or her respective place in the order conceived for making 
<br />
operational every society. Unfortunately every society in the history 
<br />
of civilization has bee always disrupted by dissidents who are always 
<br />
accused of using terrorist methods, in order to impede them to carry 
<br />
out their mission. This civilization is the only one that prevails at 
<br />
present mostly funded by opportunistic allocations and bigoted 
<br />
donations and protected by compulsive procedures decorated with 
<br />
democratic announcements. Anyhow it is the apex of civilizing 
<br />
processes conceived de facto for dehumanizing humans and 
<br />
decerebralizing minds in order to build and efficient society of 
<br />
buyers and consumers of goods produced by automatized factories.
<br />
<p>Inevitably the unconscious dynamics that characterizes the whole 
<br />
civilizing adventure has degenerated by itself and has become a 
<br />
frightening threat to humanity. Nobody knows neither could forecast 
<br />
whether it is too late to impede its collapse, but until today 31st 
<br />
January 2003 it is still valid to assume that the human potentiality 
<br />
may be awaken by means of INFORMATION humanely arranged.
<br />
<p><p>&amp;§&quot;!°°ß#&amp;/§*'#
<br />
<p><p>Therefore, based on the original meaning assigned to the word 
<br />
INFORMATION during the successful expansion of the Western 
<br />
Civilization, in my view it seems better for the time being to 
<br />
conceive and build - as a very first step - the THEORY of INFORMATION 
<br />
exclusively in the domain of human concerns determined essentially by 
<br />
the need of learning feasible ways for surviving physiologically, 
<br />
psychologically and intellectually.
<br />
<p>For this theory I have dared:
<br />
<p>1) to tentatively define information as data perceived and 
<br />
assimilated by a living being which may cause a certain behavioral 
<br />
action or reaction, without being possible to know in advance whether 
<br />
it will be useful enough for improving the survival chances of one or 
<br />
several humans
<br />
<p>2) to realize that due to causes - engendered by civilizing processes 
<br />
- that have arisen during the degradation of human values, the 
<br />
information employed for pushing ahead the unsustainable civilization 
<br />
may either be truthful or partially truthful or frankly false
<br />
<p>3) to notice that truthful information is always in practical terms a 
<br />
single perspective or a set of various perspectives of some aspects 
<br />
of the reality singularly perceived and  peculiarly interpreted by 
<br />
individuals who unavoidably are only partially tolerant
<br />
<p>4) to observe for being taken into account that humans cannot avoid 
<br />
to perform (perceive and interpret) according to biased assumptions 
<br />
that have been diversely accumulated and bizarrely arranged in every 
<br />
mind inevitably causing numberless quandaries that are altogether the 
<br />
main challenge in the generation of truthful information.
<br />
<p>5) to recognize that due to selfish interests, greedy motivations and 
<br />
egoistic feelings, at least, partially truthful and false information 
<br />
are generated by purposefully structured misinformation
<br />
<p>6) to accept as an unavoidable fact that truthfulness and falseness 
<br />
in the generation of information and misinformation are phenomena 
<br />
diversely and unpredictably affected by the superb spontaneousness 
<br />
that characterizes the human mind which may make the reasoning to 
<br />
become either tolerantly humane or heartlessly inhuman.
<br />
<p>7) to desire, expect, believe and even trust that human potentiality 
<br />
may be awakened again and again by means of a Weltanschauung ideology 
<br />
systematically updated by truthful information about the effects 
<br />
caused by the right and wrong use of truthful or partially truthful 
<br />
or frankly false information.
