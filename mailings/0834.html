This text for FIS started with the question &quot;INFORMATION, what for?&quot; 
<br />
Evidently it couldn't be ignored that information has been and still 
<br />
is indispensable for exchanging the views of humans about the various 
<br />
ways our ancestors have managed to survive and to create a human 
<br />
world, the so called homosphere, which has been not consciously 
<br />
inserted in the biosphere. Until today this homosphere - which grows 
<br />
and grows because most humans still believe that &quot;human life&quot; is 
<br />
something that has been granted forever - is the outcome of 
<br />
civilizing actions that altogether have become a phenomenon de facto, 
<br />
though generated by superb ideas that have generated brilliant 
<br />
decisions which have been intelligently conceived and cleverly 
<br />
implemented. These civilizing actions have made possible the 
<br />
manifestation of the greatest human adventure - though it has become 
<br />
gradually an experiment not sufficiently consistent and not congruous 
<br />
enough - that started very recently (only around 6 to 8 millennia 
<br />
ago) when suddenly several of our ancestors invented on their own to 
<br />
settle down here or there supported by a first knowledge of causal 
<br />
relations of natural phenomena that were perceived as utilitarian 
<br />
possibilities that presumably would assure the survival of human 
<br />
beings.
<br />
<p>In each case the invented settlement was conceived necessarily by a 
<br />
single mind, who dared to imagine and conceive his assumption as a 
<br />
feasible one; who managed to communicate immediately his brilliant 
<br />
idea to his or her congeners. One way or another, here and there 
<br />
several humans accepted to start the experiment which became an 
<br />
invitation for the participants to search continuously causal 
<br />
interactions and to integrate the knowledge they could gradually 
<br />
acquire as information needed for making reliable, therefore 
<br />
successful, the utilitarian adventure.
<br />
<p>However, it seems that pretty soon in every new settlement some 
<br />
individuals became soon motivated to invent causal relations for 
<br />
making utilitarian the compulsive participation of other people. 
<br />
Therefore it happened from the very beginning that these cleverer 
<br />
individuals considered not only feasible but even necessary to create 
<br />
suitable circumstances in order to use purposefully the majority of 
<br />
the people; those who gradually and quite consistently were &quot;invited&quot; 
<br />
to work as slaves, serfs, servants, soldiers,&#x160; those who recently 
<br />
have been identified as the human resources needed for building and 
<br />
maintaining in operation what gradually have become the civilizing 
<br />
facilities for the minorities who have managed to privilege 
<br />
themselves as the ruling elites inside every settlement.
<br />
<p>INFORMATION seems to be essentially a conceptual tool needed strictly 
<br />
and exclusively by those humans who consider necessary to organize a 
<br />
purposeful communication as needed for helping: to discover causal 
<br />
relations of existent phenomena to invent causal interactions of new 
<br />
phenomena needed for making more functional the kind of homosphere 
<br />
that has been created and maintained de facto even with the support 
<br />
of all kinds of warfare
<br />
<p>Being the dynamics of the whole civilizing processes determined 
<br />
mainly by the decision-making conceived by the elites it can be argue 
<br />
that the INFORMATION required for assuring the functionality of every 
<br />
civilizing experiment has been in a large measure invented for such a 
<br />
purpose.
<br />
<p>And the whole civilization continue being considered a magnificent 
<br />
achievement not only by the elites but also by the common people 
<br />
educated in accordance with criteria conceived for making people 
<br />
obedient and happy human resources. Unfortunately, in the view of the 
<br />
elites the whole civilizing adventure has been slightly troubled from 
<br />
time to time by dissidents, those who are accused as terrorists as 
<br />
soon as they start organizing another fight for the recognition of 
<br />
rights on Earth of one or another of the groups that are composing 
<br />
the masses.
