Thanks Terry for your remarks.
<br />
<p>&lt;New mothers ... sometimes respond to anxiety by compulsively gathering 
<br />
&lt;information -- asking everyone they know for advice, reading book after 
<br />
&lt;book.'
<br />
<p>I think 'compulsive information gathering' is a symptom of our times.
<br />
Infomania is a new syndrome - the neurotic search for informational 
<br />
gratification. 
<br />
<p>&lt;An obvious example is that sometimes information about a person's diagnosis 
<br />
&lt;is not only not helpful, but damaging. At other times, it is very, very 
<br />
&lt;useful. All depends on the specifics and psychodynamics of the case.
<br />
<p>Yes, a small amount of 'information' can be homeopathic - an excess toxic.
<br />
I agree with Karl and Edwina that there is a complex relationship between 
<br />
'too/much and 'not enough'.
<br />
<p>Re psychodynamics - why has the concept of information not found fertile 
<br />
ground in modern psychology (apart from the behaviourist 'processing' model)?
<br />
<p>I have had many discussions with one of Australia's leading psychoanalysts
<br />
about this. She works with mothers of premature babies (and also psychotics)
<br />
using methods developed from Bion and Chaos Theory. 
<br />
<p>I recently explained to her the thin IS perspective of information as 
<br />
contextualised data:
<br />
<p>&quot;Two degrees&quot; is data, &quot;two degrees outside&quot; is information 
<br />
(&quot;It's two degrees outside so you will need to wear your coat&quot; 
<br />
is presumably knowledge).
<br />
<p>Her response: &quot;That's the other end of the spectrum. I want to know 
<br />
how you feel about going outside at all. Information (memory, emotion) 
<br />
is so often hidden inside the body in a pathological form. The information 
<br />
presented to the psychoanalyst/patient is generally displaced, getting 
<br />
to the emotional truth can be obstructed by the informing process itself.
<br />
Just identifying the valid psychic data is the major problem -
<br />
particularly in psychosis.&quot;
<br />
<p>As we move from data to sense data we encounter the problem of 'psychic energy'.
<br />
This is possibly why the model of a 'psyche' as an energy/meaning 
<br />
structure which somehow 'processes' information remains a scientific mystery. 
<br />
<p>Edwina circles about this issue when she comments on the
<br />
'internal realm' in a recent post:
<br />
<p>&lt;The internal type of relation is therefore 
<br />
&lt;one of relations between what one might call 'phases' or zones of 
<br />
&lt;energy-concentrations/organizations. These relations between 
<br />
&lt;these internalized energy-phases are coordinated by an internal 
<br />
&lt;logic. This internal logic is the normative Laws of that species, or 
<br />
&lt;society or..
<br />
<p>Perhaps your next FIS paper could examine the myth of Psyche?
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
<p>John

<br />
<p><p>Dear John,
<br />
<p>As a therapist, I find the metaphor of information, disease and people 
<br />
really interesting. In my work, emotional exchange is foremost while 
<br />
information has somewhat limited value, depending on its kind and sources.
<br />
<p>An obvious example is that sometimes information about a person's diagnosis 
<br />
is not only not helpful, but damaging. At other times, it is very, very 
<br />
useful. All depends on the specifics and psychodynamics of the case.
<br />
<p>One place where information appears particularly damaging is with new 
<br />
mothers who are extremely anxious about doing the &quot;right thing&quot; with their 
<br />
babies. They sometimes respond to anxiety by compulsively gathering 
<br />
information -- asking everyone they know for advice, reading book after 
<br />
book. Inevitably, they gather opposite points of view and then screech to a 
<br />
halt about how to proceed. In this case, the search for information comes 
<br />
out of extreme insecurity and mistrust of their own natural instincts.
<br />
<p>Hope this isn't too far off base in our discussions.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Pedro,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your comment about informational entities in the neurosciences prompted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thoughts I have entertained for some time about states of health/disease 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and informational phenomena. Hopefully my comments are not too tangential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for our present forum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Certainly the metaphorical comparison between social systems and disease is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;often made (healthy economy, sick organisation etc).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can we have active or passive immunity to certain informational conditions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If information is a 'disease state'  is knowledge the antidote of choice?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does the Invisible Hand come with a surgical rubber glove?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is the obvious linkage in the pathology of Information Overload and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the reportedly fatal Internet Overuse Syndrome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;caused by an increase in stress levels from not knowing enough. Misuse of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and misunderstanding about 'information' are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part of the problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Immune System with its mechanisms of protection of (or attack against) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 'self' of an organism operates by virtue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informational cues and the physicist David Bohm was particularly interested 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the analogy but never fully fleshed it out.*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can we possibly translate this into the language of the 'biology' of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;firm?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the CEO asks &quot;Are we immune from takeovers?&quot; can we take his question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;literally?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With software viruses the parallel is obvious but some enterprises die of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sort of informational immune disease
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with information received from inside the firm combatting information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;received from outside (and vice-versa)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have been involved with several organisations where misinformation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;treated as true information and the host has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been finally taken over by the parasite - in recent times the CEO himself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is often the parasite (:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And I think there are good historical examples of informational autoimmune 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disease in certain companies (like Enron)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and political states (like the USSR ).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You or Ted may be aware of work done in this area - if so I'd be interested 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to hear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;John H
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*&quot;What Bohm was speaking about in this context was what he called &quot;active 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information&quot;. Bohm proposed that quantum processes are guided by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information - not passive information in the form of encoded data but an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actual activity of information. Bohm's analogy is to the way subtle 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information in a television signal impresses itself upon, and thus gives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;form to, the crude energy entering the electrical plug. In this way a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subtle signal produces pictures and sounds. For Bohm, information is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;activity that acts on both matter and energy. He also connected the idea of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;active information to the operation of the immune system, which he saw as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;form of intelligence delocalized over the whole body. For Bohm a change of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning in the mind became a change of actual being in the body. &quot; David
