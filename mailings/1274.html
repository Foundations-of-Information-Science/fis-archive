<p>
Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>first, I like very much Michael Leyton's text about the meaning of music. 
<br />
For more detailed analysis, I need to go through it again and again, but now 
<br />
I will give some general comments and suggestions.
<br />
<p>Maximal memory stores could mean that the musical composition can express 
<br />
much more than it contains explicitly as a linear text. In general, it can 
<br />
express the maximum information capacity which rises to the meaning of the 
<br />
absolute. In terms of Schopenhauer, it expresses Wille by itself, not via 
<br />
its representations. It is possible because music is the main art that is 
<br />
organized in time. And time, according to the quantum mechanical views, is a 
<br />
way of reduction of the potential field (Wille or Ding an sich).
<br />
<p>What is the way of explication of the absolute itself? One way is to create 
<br />
a flowing potential field which is greatly emotionally affectable.  The 
<br />
greatest examples are Chopin and Scriabin. Another way is to set a formal 
<br />
structure which contains fixed elements and free developments within the 
<br />
fixed structure. The fugue as it was introduced by I.S. Bach is the most 
<br />
profound form for this. It may look as strictly deterministic, but can you 
<br />
imagine continuation of the unfinished last contrapunctus of the Art of 
<br />
Fugue? All parts of this great composition are considered by the author as a 
<br />
some kind of training, similar to God's training in creation of the world. 
<br />
And the resulting world contains both computable (physical laws) and 
<br />
non-computable (free will) parts, which are present in this structure. To 
<br />
understand this means to rise above all contradictions and suffering caused 
<br />
by them.  Thus a solution comes as a final fugue in Beethoven's sonata op. 
<br />
106, or in his Grosse Fuge which finalizes not just his 13th quartet (he 
<br />
wrote another final for it) but all his creative life.
<br />
<p>Another possibility of the development of the meaning of absolute is to 
<br />
generate a structure which develops initial simple structure as in the case 
<br />
of Bach's Goldberg variations or Beethoven's Diabelli variations. In the 
<br />
last example, the initial theme is even primitive, but it can generate all 
<br />
infinite world in which it finally transforms into a beautiful minuet. In 
<br />
this world some unexpected appearances occur, as Mozart-like movement in one 
<br />
variation. This development is similar to the unfolding of the initial 
<br />
structure of myth, that is why C. Levi-Strauss mentioned a similarity 
<br />
between the structures of myth and music.  A similar variational development 
<br />
with the end open to infinity occurs in the final of Beethoven's op. 111 
<br />
(Arietta). From this point of view, the finals like &quot;An die Freude&quot; or of 
<br />
the last 16th quartet contain more relative meaning, representing a one 
<br />
particular answer to the basic question of being.  Also strictly religious 
<br />
works usually follow some particular tradition and may be to some extent 
<br />
less meaningful in the sense of carrying absolute meaning.
<br />
<p>Representation of the absolute meaning as a negation could be considered in 
<br />
some works of Webern (e.g. in his variations op. 27) or in the different 
<br />
musical language in the last works of Shostakovich (e.g. 15th quartet).
<br />
<p>To develop the approach to describe the meaning in music, we need to combine 
<br />
some elements of modern logic with the semiotical point of view that the 
<br />
sign can express much more than it has in its structure. This could follow 
<br />
Florensky's approach to signs maybe more than Peircean.  Generally speaking, 
<br />
I would say yes, music has a meaning, but this is a special meaning which we 
<br />
may not be able to catch formally. But we can approach to it using 
<br />
logical-semiotical tools, remembering Wittgensteinian impossibility to say, 
<br />
but the possibility to express.
<br />
<p>All the best,
<br />
Andrei Igamberdiev
