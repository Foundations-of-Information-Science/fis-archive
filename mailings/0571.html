<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Many thanks to Andrei and Shu-Kun for their fascinating messages on
<br />
molecular recognition. It is a happy coincidence that a bunch of fisers are
<br />
developing ideas on the different aspects of molecular recognition. 
<br />
<p>For instance, Rafael Lahoz (see his paper) has been working with Hameroff's
<br />
group on cytoskeleton computation by quantum coherence. García Olivares (he
<br />
contributes too) has improved my initial molecular-automata kinetic model
<br />
with a very sophisticate mathematical apparatus, and I am myself exploring
<br />
the whole eukariotic evolution of signaling systems (scaffolds,
<br />
signalosomes, protein-kinases chains) and most of the advanced uses of
<br />
proteolitic machinery as based on molecular recognition. The fantastic
<br />
economy on recognition items (seemingly, N Coulombian elements may be used
<br />
within an efficency scheme of N exp 2 thanks to the quantum processes
<br />
explained by Andrei) was almost an absolute necessity for the evolution of
<br />
nervous systems and as a molecular background of human symbolic
<br />
communication. We have to remember in that regard the very pioneeering
<br />
insights of Michael Conrad too: his 'tactilizing processing' as a basic
<br />
tool of intraneuronal processing systems and eukaryotic 'evolvability'.
<br />
Also, the chair of our coming batch of papers, Peter Érdi, has done a great
<br />
job on the formal analysis of nonlinarities in kinetic systems. And around
<br />
Ray Paton and Koichiro Matsuno there are seminal work on progress about
<br />
simulations and experiences of biomolecular computation...
<br />
<p>In sum, that at fis we could envision a fascinating synthesis of the
<br />
quantum-molecular
<br />
statistics-kinetic-dynamic-computational-structural-evolutionary aspects of
<br />
molecular recognition. At least I am not aware of much 'integrative' work
<br />
done on the whole molecular recognition theme--but sure that some parties
<br />
have already been advancing the synthesis (any further info is very
<br />
welcome!). Thus I wonder whether it could make any sense at all for any
<br />
financing bodies, supporting us for at last a small retreat about this
<br />
applied subject.  
<br />
<p>About the other discussion lines currently open, I rely on Ted's excellent
<br />
synopsis.  Quite probably, a mature info science will be able to produce
<br />
very original ideas about those informational things (are they things?)
<br />
called 'enterprises' or 'firms'. The ecological niche becomes too difficult
<br />
for an info scheme, although i agree in the necessity and importance of the
<br />
ecological view (the final target of bioinfo adaptions: survival in the
<br />
niche).
<br />
<p>Finally, Karl' s views on info are for me... tautological. Greatly
<br />
tautological, let me add (remember for instance 'survival of the fitest'):
<br />
because his tautology is accompanied directly by a new approach to set
<br />
theory founded upon a new number theory. The basic tool, multidimensional
<br />
partitions, largely unexplored,  might be a mine of scientific ideas.
<br />
Morris' message &amp; paper, and my own one, contain some of the simplest items
<br />
we have been exploring here in Zaragoza during these recent years (José
<br />
Pastor, now retired, did a great computational job about the theme too). In
<br />
spite of some small disagreements and the usual (complete) lack of funding,
<br />
and the lack of time, we have been happy in the collaboration with Karl.
<br />
Some of Karl's papers (almost all his work is unpublished yet) are going to
<br />
appear in our home fis web-pages right now. It will help to advance the
<br />
discussion on a firmer basis, I believe. Because going ahead will get very
<br />
difficult, as we have experienced here...
<br />
<p>It would be very long, but a connection could be made along the above lines
<br />
with the symmetry theme, the conditions for 'natural law' (as said, I can
<br />
only agree partially with James very cogent realism), the observer 'limited
<br />
prehension' and the perspectivistic consequences... Perhaps I will attempt
<br />
that connection with the remaining 50% of my weekly discussion capital
<br />
<p>best wishes to all,
<br />
<p>Pedro
