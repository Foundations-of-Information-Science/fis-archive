                    Dear All,
                    <br />
                <p>I would like to begin with my apologies to all, and especially to Igor
                    <br />
                    (who had to hold up the dialog on his own) for my absence since the
                    <br />
                    initiation of this thread. I had missed a major deadline and had to
                    <br />
                    forsake most other activities to make my tardy submission.
                    <br />
                <p>As Igor has done a most admirable job of answering queries and comments, I
                    <br />
                    will confine myself to several offhand remarks prompted by some of the
                    <br />
                    postings:

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; sunshine). The production of these tomatos is completely
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge-based. Indeed, this is energy-costly, but energy is only
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite at the level of the universe (and not at the level of the earth).
                    </em><br />
                <p>I would have to differ with the last sentence, inasmuch as I see energy
                    <br />
                    being more of a problem at the global level than at the universal level.
                    <br />
                    There is enormous energy everywhere, at all levels. The problem is one of
                    <br />
                    availability, and availability is more of a problem locally. But the
                    <br />
                    problem of availability, as increasingly difficult as it is becoming here
                    <br />
                    on earth, remains secondary to the problem of sinks. That is, the second
                    <br />
                    law tells us that we cannot use energy without creating disorder
                    <br />
                    (entropy), and it is the transport of said entropy away from the earth
                    <br />
                    that is becoming even more limiting than dwindling energy sources. When
                    <br />
                    entropy accumulates faster than it can be disposed of, the result is
                    <br />
                    generically known as &quot;pollution&quot;, but the effects are usually more
                    <br />
                    widespread than even that term connotes. Global warming and the ozone hole
                    <br />
                    are two examples of our inability to get rid of produced entropy quickly
                    <br />
                    enough.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus, one can entertain very different worldviews. The interfaces among
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; them can be considered as sources of innovation, for example, when
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; market perspectives and research perspectives can be interfaced.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps, you can easily integrate this into your model?
                    </em><br />
                <p>I understand your last question (advice) to be to incorporate both the
                    <br />
                    resource-based and the information-based aspects of the economy.
                    <br />
                <p>I will remark that Herman Daly, a well-known Ecological Economist bade us
                    <br />
                    some time ago to differentiate &quot;growth&quot; from &quot;development&quot;. By the former
                    <br />
                    he meant mostly the extensive (in the sense of &quot;size&quot;) aspects of
                    <br />
                    resource- based activities, and by the latter the streamlining of economic
                    <br />
                    processes that would accrue via more refined (usually information driven)
                    <br />
                    activities.
                    <br />
                <p>A major objective of my first book, &quot;Growth and Development: Ecosystems
                    <br />
                    Phenomenology&quot; (Springer 1986) was to make exactly that distinction as it
                    <br />
                    pertains to maturing ecosystems. Toward that end, I constructed the
                    <br />
                    network measure &quot;ascendency&quot;, which consists of two factors -- the first
                    <br />
                    being the gross level of system activity (&quot;total system throughput&quot;
                    <br />
                    [TST] in economic jargon) and the second, the coherence between the system
                    <br />
                    inputs and outputs (both for the system as a whole and, more importantly,
                    <br />
                    for the internal exchanges.) Any increase in the former I identified with
                    <br />
                    &quot;growth&quot;. (Recall TST is a close relative of GDP.) Increases in the second
                    <br />
                    term (the &quot;average mutual information&quot; of the flow structure) I identified
                    <br />
                    with &quot;development. (A flimsy analogy upon which to base a book, I know,
                    <br />
                    but it has held up under subsequent scrutiny. :)
                    <br />
                <p>So, to your point: As resources begin to limit economies, either because
                    <br />
                    of dwindling supplies OR saturated sinks, extensive growth must slow and
                    <br />
                    economic activity turns toward information- mediated development. I think
                    <br />
                    the separation was built into the original model.

                <p>As some of you are doubtless already aware, Howard Odum devoted the latter
                    <br />
                    half of his professional career to formulating a full energy calculus for
                    <br />
                    human artifacts. He called his energy calculus &quot;emergy&quot; (for &quot;embodied
                    <br />
                    energy&quot;.) The idea was to trace all economic products back through the web
                    <br />
                    of processes (via input-output type matrix calculations) that created them
                    <br />
                    to their very original energy sources. It stands to reason what Igor so
                    <br />
                    nicely illustrated, that items high in the economic chain of process would
                    <br />
                    have very high embodied energies.
                    <br />
                <p>Well before he developed the notion of emergy, Howard was keenly aware of
                    <br />
                    the enormous fossil fuel subsidies behind agricultural products (like
                    <br />
                    Loet's tomatoes.:) A chapter in his 1971 book, &quot;Environment, Power and
                    <br />
                    Society&quot; was entitled &quot;Potatoes from Oil&quot;. The meaning is immediately
                    <br />
                    apparent to us now, but I recall how puzzled I was in 1972 to encounter
                    <br />
                    the notion for the first time.
                    <br />
                <p>Yet another contribution of Howard Odum to the economic dialog was to
                    <br />
                    emphasize the notion of &quot;net energy yield&quot; for the extraction of energy
                    <br />
                    resources. Thus oil has something like an 11:1 yield ratio (meaning one
                    <br />
                    gets 11 joules of useable energy for every joule expended in pumping,
                    <br />
                    transporting and refining.) Most of the alternative sources are much
                    <br />
                    lower, and there is debate that some, such as ethanol from grain, could
                    <br />
                    even be less than 1:1.

                <p>Yes, all of what Stan says is true. He was nice enough not to mention what
                    <br />
                    is the primary (and almost only) matter of disagreement between us --
                    <br />
                    namely, whether &quot;The second law trumps all.&quot; We agree that the second law
                    <br />
                    is inviolate at macroscopic scales. We disagree as to whether or not the
                    <br />
                    second law is the final cause of all organization. Stan feels it is. I
                    <br />
                    don't.
                    <br />
                <p>My take is that the creation of entropy is &quot;accidental&quot; to all real
                    <br />
                    processes, not always causative. In particular, I see in autocatalysis a
                    <br />
                    &quot;self-entailing&quot; aspect that is not derivative of any associated gradient
                    <br />
                    in energy (or exergy, to be more exact.) Hence, my opinion is that nature
                    <br />
                    is not all scripted by the second law. There is an opposing tendency,
                    <br />
                    attributable mostly to the action of autocatalysis (and the partial
                    <br />
                    autonomy thereof) that acts in almost dialectical fashion against entropy.
                    <br />
                    The metaphor of the dialectic is important, because the opposing
                    <br />
                    tendencies are actually mutually obligate at a larger scale. But I won't
                    <br />
                    bore anyone further with that now.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The issue of loss of socioeconomic diversity is closely related to

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; SS: &quot;efficiency&quot;? What is this efficiency?
                    </em><br />
                <p>This is efficiency in the first law sense of the word, i.e., use of power.
                    <br />
                    It is to be distinguished from &quot;efficiency&quot; in its second law sense of the
                    <br />
                    word, which is extent of utilization. I.e., a given amount of energy is
                    <br />
                    available to a system. The degree to which that energy is utilized is its
                    <br />
                    efficiency in the second-law sense of the word.
                    <br />
                <p>The two senses are not entirely compatible. To utilize power at a high
                    <br />
                    rate requires a system to export lots of unutilized energy. Conversely,
                    <br />
                    maximal utilization can be approximated only at very low rates, as Odum
                    <br />
                    and Pinkerton explained in their 1955 article (Am. Sci. 43: 331-343.) When
                    <br />
                    resources are very abundant, efficiency in the first law sense seems more
                    <br />
                    significant, whilst when there are very rare, second law efficiency
                    <br />
                    becomes the decisive factor. Ascendency was scripted to bridge the
                    <br />
                    transition from one to the other. When resources are abundant, first law
                    <br />
                    efficiency prevails and maximal power (in the sense of Alfred Lotka, as
                    <br />
                    exhibited by an increasing TST) is a decisive advantage. As they become
                    <br />
                    rare, increasing ascendency is maintained by second law efficiencies
                    <br />
                    inherent in a high AMI.

                    ecological sense of the word. Notice that this is not a normative
                    <br />
                    statement. Obviously, most (but not everyone) would prefer living under

                    the conditions prevailing in New York. That doesn't make it more

                    persistent or sustainable.
                    <br />
                <p>The various coordination mechanisms Loet cites are costly. They abet
                    <br />
                    efficiency (coherent operation), but contribute to persistence only
                    <br />
                    insofar as there is functional redundancy (and therefore inefficiencies)
                    <br />
                    among them. The coordination mechanisms are quite costly to maintain, and
                    <br />
                    when they fail, so does the system. (Just ask any American who has
                    <br />
                    witnessed a major power failure in a US city! :)

                    &quot;conveniences&quot; when they fail (as the inevitably do.)
                    <br />
                <p>Maybe the point is better made by switching from economic systems to
                    <br />
                    warfare systems. (Ugh!) Many weapons systems are extremely high tech these

                    <br />
                    colleagues] has turned into a large personal fortune.) And so we see TV
                    <br />
                    footage of missiles passing into the window of a building and showing the

                    message to the world. What we don't hear about is the failure rate on such
                    <br />
                    weapons, which apparently is considerable. And there is the final irony,
                    <br />
                    which those who command these weapons of wonder somehow never were able to
                    <br />
                    contemplate -- that the whole high tech system can be ground to a
                    <br />
                    standstill by relatively primitive weaponry and the will to use it at any

                    personal cost.

                <p>One thing that struck me is that &quot;information-based systems&quot; is used in
                    <br />
                    two different ways. There is the technological know-how and there are the
                    <br />
                    market-based speculations. As I believe I mentioned on FIS before, the
                    <br />
                    latter can completely overwhelm the former. When one compares the amount
                    <br />
                    of money that is exchanged for goods and services with the amounts that
                    <br />
                    are exchanged to &quot;follow other money&quot; (investments, speculations, etc.),
                    <br />
                    it is not surprising that the latter is larger than the former. What
                    <br />
                    shocked me out of my mind, however, was the revelation that the latter is
                    <br />
                    almost FORTY TIMES larger than the former!! Now any systems analyst worth
                    <br />
                    his/her salt will recognize that circulations within the subsystem that is
                    <br />
                    40X the remaining system can easily come to dominate the entire ensemble.
                    <br />
                    In the US we have a popular comic strip named &quot;Dilbert&quot;. The running joke

                    and how they are so out- of- synch with the process of designing,

                    changes either too slowly or too quickly risks extermination. While
