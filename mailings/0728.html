<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is really have some difficulty to understand how we can think that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;logic&quot; is a (narrow) human invention!!!????
</em><br />
<p>Fenzl--
<br />
<p>(My second posting this week. Limiting to two seems a good rule.)
<br />
<p>We are talking about four domains here:
<br />
<p>--1. How things actually work
<br />
<p>--2. How things appear to work
<br />
<p>--3. How we express and reason about how things work
<br />
<p>--4. How the entities involved &quot;express and reason about how things work&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina used the term &quot;logic&quot; in the context of Socratic caves, 
<br />
Aristotle and Peirce. She used terms like &quot;rational&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;reasonable.&quot; To my mind (and many I presume) her use of the term 
<br />
puts her use in domain 3. My point was that most workers in logic 
<br />
have many different logics. All are invented for different purposes 
<br />
and distort the reality they represent and about which they reason.
<br />
<p>You used the term &quot;logic&quot; in such a way that means (I think) that 
<br />
there is some coherent set of laws in domain 1 that result in 
<br />
reproducable effects. That's different.
<br />
<p>As common terms of art in computer science, I use &quot;mechanics&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;physics&quot; for domain 1, and &quot;logic&quot; variously for the rest. I believe 
<br />
there is a large distance of abstraction among these four. Edwina at 
<br />
least believes 2 and 1 are the same or close and &quot;logic&quot; covers both. 
<br />
Whatever you choose is a religious decision, but there are tens of 
<br />
thousands of places where you can recount what people said about the 
<br />
the relationships among 1, 2 and 3. I suppose it has pedagogical 
<br />
value, but that Christmas tree is pretty well decorated.
<br />
<p>I interpret the FIS to agenda to be concerned with domain 4 and 
<br />
relationships with the others. There are very few forums for this, so 
<br />
I suppose the focus here to be worth preserving.
<br />
<p>I can even claim some small role in &quot;creating&quot; a logic myself. Twenty 
<br />
years ago a problem somewhat similar to the FIS one was defined in 
<br />
terms of the restrictions of existing logics. We specified 
<br />
characteristics of a new logic to design, and essentially established 
<br />
a research center to do so. I played a minor role in the problem 
<br />
identification and arranging the funding. The center is still strong 
<br />
at Stanford. The project was led by our probably greatest living 
<br />
logician at the time (who died last year). The logic is &quot;situation 
<br />
logic,&quot; which at his death was being extended to &quot;channel logic&quot; to 
<br />
address something much like domain 4.
<br />
<p>Whatever we invent, it will likely be algebra-friendly and exploit 
<br />
group theory. The route of abstraction among the four domains 
<br />
(especially 3 and 4) must be formally specified; I am hopeful that 
<br />
category theory will guide that.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
