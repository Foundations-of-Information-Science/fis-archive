<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Returning to the discussion about optimization days ago, I believe it is a 
<br />
really important piece in the fis puzzle. At the beginning of this 
<br />
conference I ventured about the close relationship between three dynamic 
<br />
optimization principles that could be understood as fundamental 'pillars' 
<br />
of the info bridge: biological maximization of fitness, neurodynamic 
<br />
minimization of 'desajuste' (neural entropy), and rational maximization of 
<br />
utility-- they were respectively referred to such 'saint patrons' as 
<br />
Darwin, Ramon y Cajal, and Adam Smith.
<br />
<p>It is in this highly dynamic-functional context (more than in the strictly 
<br />
structural one), where the biggest difficulties to optimize, to satisfy 
<br />
multiple contradictory constraints, can be found. So, no wonder that the 
<br />
respective informational entities --either at the cellular, organismic or 
<br />
societal level-- have to incur in amazingly complex accounting processes in 
<br />
order to orientate in an optimized direction their ongoing 
<br />
self-construction processes and keep themselves 'alive' in the adaptive 
<br />
interaction with their environments.
<br />
<p>We can look at the above dynamism in quite different time scales. The 
<br />
largest possible one is the vast paleontological panorama of species 
<br />
adaptation (phyla or classes indeed). I mentioned days ago van Valen's Red 
<br />
Queen hypothesis, proposed in the 70's I think, nowadays well-developed 
<br />
formally by Kauffman's 'rugged landscapes' and other authors. Actually, 
<br />
Kauffman's approach incorporates the emerging non-linearity that each 
<br />
species has to confront when climbing to a 'mount fitness' that deforms and 
<br />
reacts as the species tries to move upwards (as John C noted). It does not 
<br />
mean an 'impossible task' provided that the inter-species dynamic coupling 
<br />
keeps below some moderate boundaries. Then, evolving genomes may explore 
<br />
more or less OK within the other evolving genomes and get caught into a 
<br />
co-evolving niche of co-adapted species...(a very conspicuous example: 
<br />
coevolution of flowering plants and insects)
<br />
<p>As far as I know, some of the gaps in this approach (eg, it was not leading 
<br />
very well to reasonable models of extinction) have been tackled by 
<br />
different complementary/competing approaches, partly outside the Santa Fe 
<br />
complexity groups. For instance, Self-Organized Criticality, by Per Bak and 
<br />
others. They have managed to produce co-evolution models that incorporate 
<br />
bona fide 'punctuated equilibrium' dynamics, conducing to fast periods of 
<br />
massive extinctions and intense evolutionary change followed by long 
<br />
periods of stasis, and massive extinction and evolutionary episodes again 
<br />
(classical Stephen Gould's views on macroevolution). Although SOC has 
<br />
gotten a lot of interdisciplinary clutch, perhaps the most appreciated 
<br />
theoretical approach has been built around the 'coupled map lattices' 
<br />
(Kaneko, Tsuda, Freeman) that, as far as I know, implies the least 
<br />
assumptions and has the most elegant 'dynamic systems theory' basements 
<br />
(and is leading to new fertile developments).
<br />
<p>Let me emphasize that, rather unexpectedly, power laws show up in these 
<br />
three different approaches. It is quite interesting that as a result, 
<br />
either of Boolean nets, or of differential equations, or stochastic 
<br />
dynamical systems, we find the power law as a sort of common signature for 
<br />
adaptation processes. For some authors, notoriously Per Bak, it is quite 
<br />
unclear the why and how of this generalized emergence of power laws.... 
<br />
(the very laws John C and me were talking about a few days ago in the 
<br />
metabolic budget context).
<br />
<p>The Italian economist Paretto was the first author to point at such power 
<br />
laws; thereafter Zipf worked on their pervasive presence in other fields. 
<br />
And now we find them as a generalized outcome of the most interesting 
<br />
adaptive games played by informational entities somehow involved in an 
<br />
endless coupling of structural / generative / communicational processes.
<br />
<p>Why should the work of the 'invisible hand' of information blindly conduce 
<br />
to power law outcomes, irrespective of the molecular, neuronal or economic 
<br />
players? Intriguingly, the easiest way to produce a power law is by means 
<br />
of Karl's partitions (and conceptually it is not far away from Shu-Kun 
<br />
approach to 'entropy of mixing')...
<br />
<p>I would also like to relate these adaptive games to the processing and 
<br />
self-constructing limitations of the informational agents (so the need of 
<br />
specialization and the further problems of integration found in all realms: 
<br />
molecular, neuronal, social, interdisciplinary). And also to the 
<br />
considerations that John H made weeks ago in his comments to Floridi: 'Is 
<br />
the flow of information quantitatively directional?' I believe it is, and 
<br />
that the above processing march by the info agents under the guidance of 
<br />
the invisible hand towards their natural places (necessarily including 
<br />
'extinction, degradation, etc.) impinges into our own conversion 
<br />
data/meanings too. Meaning would be best understood as a byproduct of 
<br />
ontogenetic adaptation...
<br />
<p>all the best
<br />
