<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Steven,
<br />
<p>In your Email you discussed a number of fundamental questions about
<br />
relation of QI and CI, and more generally QM and CM. I remark that if
<br />
one defines information through entropy than if fact information theory
<br />
is reduced to probability theory. Thus the problem of differences
<br />
between QI and CI is just a new representation of teh very old problem 
<br />
of relation between quantum probability and classical probability. 
<br />
<p>Why do we use the Kolmogorov measure-theoretic model everywhere becides
<br />
QM? But in QM we should manipulate not with measures but with complex
<br />
probability amplitudes? This problem was discussed since 1930th in
<br />
hundreds of papers and books. There are two main viewpoints. The first
<br />
one can be considered as conventional: \&quot;It is just because NATURE 
<br />
behave in such a way!\&quot; 
<br />
J. von Neumann pointed out that quatum randomness differs crucially from
<br />
classical randomness. Classical randomness is reducible to variety of
<br />
properties of systems in ensembles. Quantum randomness is IRREDUCIBLE!
<br />
<p>Therefore the main difference between QI and CI is that the first one is
<br />
about irreducible randomness, so entropy is not just ENSEMBLE-ENTROPY, 
<br />
quantum entropy and hence quantum information are based on irreducible
<br />
randomness.
<br />
<p>Why does an electron irreducibly random, but a ball not? The Copenhagen
<br />
reply is that because Nature is such. If we follow this line then we
<br />
should agree that there should be two different probability theory:
<br />
a) Kolmogorov measure-theoretic; b) Quantum -- complex Hilbert space, 
<br />
and hence two different information theories: one applied to quantum 
<br />
systems and another to classical. 
<br />
<p>As was emphasiwed in my previous Email, the main problem of this
<br />
(Copenhagen)  approach is that it is not clear which systems should be
<br />
considered as quantum and which as classical? Are moleculas irreducibly
<br />
or reducibly random? Are cells? Human beings?
<br />
<p>As you see, up to now I have not even mentioned so called quantum
<br />
nonlocality or entanglement. I shall come back to these problems later.
<br />
But I emphasize that they role in the discussion - quantum as opposed to
<br />
classical - is overestimated. The difference between classical and
<br />
quantum probability and CI and QI was well know long before Bell\'s
<br />
theorem. And I think that the real explanation of this difference has
<br />
not so much to do with nonlocality (my private viewpoint).
<br />
<p>Personally I think that classical and quantum probability and CI and QI
<br />
could be unified. I shall soon come with mathematical arguments. At the
<br />
moment I pay attention to a purely experimental argument. The
<br />
irreducible quantum randomness in experimental framework is always
<br />
exhibited through the ensemble randomness!!! This is the fundamental
<br />
experimental fact that could not be ignored! We could not demonstrate 
<br />
that one fixed photon or electron is \&quot;irreducibly random\&quot; -- we destroy
<br />
its state after the first measurement. Therefore for one fixed 
<br />
experimental framework we are not able to distinguish \&quot;irreducible
<br />
quantum randomness\&quot; and \&quot;reducible classical randomness.\&quot; The problem 
<br />
with the classical probabilistic description arises when we conbine the
<br />
statistical data from a few different expermental arrangements. 
<br />
<p>In particular, this we do in the EPR-Bohm experiment: we should consider 
<br />
at least 4 different pairs of settings (directions) for polarization
<br />
measurement. However, to see the difference between classical and
<br />
quantum probabilistic descriptions we need not consider entangled 
<br />
systems. It is enough to consider the two slit experiment for three 
<br />
experimental settings: 1) both slits are open; 2) the first slit is open 
<br />
and the second is closed; 3) vice versa. If we collect three gistograms,
<br />
three probability distributions of particles on the registration screen, 
<br />
p_12, p_1, p_2, then we shall see (and this is just an experimental
<br />
fact) that in contrast to classical probability theory:
<br />
p_12 \\not= [p_1 + p_2]/2 (here the factor 1/2 should appear if we
<br />
consider a source of phtonts that is localted syymetrically with respect
<br />
to slits). So the classical formular of total probability, by that
<br />
it should be that p_12 = [p_1 + p_2]/2 is violated!!! This story is well
<br />
described in my book \&quot;Interpretations of Probability\&quot;, VSP Int. Publ.,
<br />
1999 (second edition 2004). Pay attention that there was nothing about
<br />
nonlocality or entanglement, or even composite systems. 
<br />
<p>My opinion is that the real problem is not in some distinguishing
<br />
features of so called \&quot;quantum systems\&quot;, but in combining of statistical
<br />
data from a few different experiments. I claim that the same problems
<br />
would appear in many other situations where we make such a combining of
<br />
data. QM was just the first example. I put this in the mathematical
<br />
framework in a series of papers, see e.g. 
<br />
<a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302194">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302194</a>
<br />
<p>It was shown that if one operate with CONTEXTUAL PROBABILITIES, so
<br />
probability-measures depending on complexes of experimental physical
<br />
conditions, then one will not have any problem with quantum 
<br />
probabilities. If we choose such a viewpoint then we shall lose all
<br />
mysteries of QM and QI. One may find QI-representation for information
<br />
corresponding to different contexts (in physics, psychology, chemistry
<br />
and so on), see e.g. <a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307201">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307201</a>
<br />
on experimental evidences of  quantum_like probabilistic behaviour of 
<br />
cognitive systems.
<br />
<p>P.S. But if you like nonlocality,  you could proceed with such an
<br />
interpretation. There is nothing wrong, since the mathematical apparatus
<br />
is correct in any way!

<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Andrei and List,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been reading the session opening post for a few days now and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to make sense of it in terms of the Foundations of Information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These questions continue to be raised and I am glad the session here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causes me to return to them.  They continue to be the center of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ongoing crisis in physics.  I am not sure of the state of play - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be useful to me to have a physicist summarize the latest work. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The last paper I reviewed on the subject was James Malley\'s paper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="../../arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/0402/0402126.pdf">http://arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/0402/0402126.pdf</a>)  which, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, I thought convincingly showed that EPR results do not commute. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper from Daniele Tommasini 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="../../philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000651/00/locaqft.pdf">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000651/00/locaqft.pdf</a>) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to show that EPR is unmeasurable.  I\'d like to hear the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these papers today, if anyone knows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was fortunate to be in a conversation with Roger Penrose a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ago about these questions and he put it rather well by saying that he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was troubled that cricket balls did not appear to behave according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rules of quantum physics. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a number of standing questions about entanglement theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially as it related of molecular biology. For example:  Is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire organism considered to be an entangled entity?  What is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical and experimental justification for stem cells as origin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entangled cell structures?  How does that work according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entanglement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics?  It is simple to consider entanglement in the case of single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photons, it is rather more difficult to generalize it.  Although, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aggregate manifestations of entanglement may, in fact, be easier to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with both experimentally and theoretically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What Penrose is getting at by the above remark is that if such states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entanglement/non-locality and superposition do exist at the quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level they must surely manifest at the classical level.  Andrei\'s
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appeal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to scale in his recent post seems unreasonable (he essentially asks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what increase of mass entanglement stops). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence, entangled states/non-locality, superposition, must necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the mechanics of information theory.  In other words, we need a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of information that unifies classical and quantum theories -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we need some reasonable explanation of why there should be two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there may, in fact, be ready manifestation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entanglement/non-locality at the classical level underlying the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integration of experience in senses. If this is not a classical level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifestation of entanglement and non-locality then it requires that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do something like Jonathan Edwards\' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="../../www.ucl.ac.uk/~regfjxe/aw.htm">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~regfjxe/aw.htm</a>) proposal and reduce integrated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience to single cells.  This does not seem likely in my view 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the argument reduces to a point and if it does not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; locality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues remain within the cell.  However, I do think Jonathan\'s work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very interesting and worthy.  In my view, even if the manifestation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isolated to a single cell or just a few cells in the brain, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; locality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue is a problem for sentience engineering and cognitive science. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Obvious example: smash fingers from both hands in a door. How is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can integrate the pain of each together in a single cognition?) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, I do currently assume in my work that there is this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifestation of entanglement/non-locality at the classical level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentience engineering and that it does explain the integration of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.  However, whether this non-locality and associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensory / 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive integration relates directly to EPR I leave as an open 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.  There are many miles to go before we sleep.  It certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be convenient, however, if I could say with some certainty that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all organisms are entangled entities - in a single whole or in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to the Toshiba device, as they say here in the USA, \&quot;I\'m from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Missouri\&quot; (the \&quot;show me\&quot; state) - I will wait until they actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to show before passing judgment.
