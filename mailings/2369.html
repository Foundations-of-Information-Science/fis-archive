Dear Richard, Dear FIS Colleagues:
<br />
(I hope you will accept my addressing you by your first name 
<br />
as just an adaptation to the friendly style of FIS 
<br />
discussions.)   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not surprised that the issue how to define 
<br />
information is coming back to the discussion of other 
<br />
matters related to information. I am actually very happy, 
<br />
because it confirms importance of the continuing work in 
<br />
this direction.  
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your proposal to develop a form of taxonomy of information 
<br />
is very interesting. The reference to biological taxonomy 
<br />
brings another argument for informational taxonomy. Long 
<br />
before there was any agreement on what does it mean &quot;life&quot; 
<br />
(well, still there is no common agreement, but there are at 
<br />
least quite clear positions on this subject,) the forms of 
<br />
life have been categorized, and this categorization has had 
<br />
great impact on the development of biology. So, it could be 
<br />
argued, when we cannot reach agreement what information is, 
<br />
we may be able to agree on inter-relations between its 
<br />
different forms. It can help in the development of 
<br />
information science. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is however another side of the issue. Biological 
<br />
taxonomy is based on Aristotelean genus/species form of 
<br />
definition. Actually, biological taxonomy is using the 
<br />
logical terminology of genus and species for its two levels 
<br />
of the hierarchical order. Thus, your proposal of creating 
<br />
a taxonomy of information is not completely unrelated to 
<br />
the attempts to use the classical (genus/species) form of 
<br />
definition to define information. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the discussion last year there were several voices 
<br />
(including mine,) that for instance using the concept of 
<br />
data (or datum) to define information is an error as datum 
<br />
is a special instance of information. As an argument (not 
<br />
very clear to me, as the situation in this case is 
<br />
reversed,) impredicative definitions have been mentioned. As 
<br />
I understand, not everyone supported insistence on using the 
<br />
classical form of the definition. Thus, if a genus/species 
<br />
definition of information is just an option, why should we 
<br />
expect that a taxonomy of information can help.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am mathematician and physicist by education, I am 
<br />
looking for the definition in this classical genus/species 
<br />
(or genus/differentia) form. This is why I have formulated 
<br />
in this form the definition which I have proposed (before 
<br />
the discussion and in my contributions to the discussion 
<br />
last year) and which is directing me in my further research. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, from this point of view I agree that your proposal 
<br />
makes sense. The mutual relations of concepts related to 
<br />
information are important for its understanding. It is some 
<br />
form of looking for understanding information from the 
<br />
(conceptual) inside. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think that more important is to find an 
<br />
appropriate perspective on the concept of information from 
<br />
the outside. How is the concept of information related to 
<br />
the other concepts?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the discussion last year, as well as in many earlier 
<br />
discussions, I could see the same problem. In many 
<br />
contributions to the discussion I could see reflection of, 
<br />
in my opinion naive and incorrect, belief that the more 
<br />
general concept we want to define (information is such a 
<br />
general concept,) the more &quot;common sense&quot; concepts should be 
<br />
used in explanation (definiendum.) This is the reason why so 
<br />
popular is an &quot;explanation&quot; of information by &quot;uncertainty&quot; 
<br />
(originally, probably because of its &quot;scientific&quot; 
<br />
association with quantum mechanics and the Uncertainty 
<br />
Principle.) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that only a definition of information 
<br />
based on the concepts with firm philosophical foundations 
<br />
can be of any value for the development of information 
<br />
science. This is why I have proposed probably the oldest, 
<br />
and for sure thoroughly examined philosophical problem 
<br />
of &quot;one vs. many&quot; as a background for the concept of 
<br />
information. I would accept use of the concept of a form 
<br />
with its rich philosophical tradition for this purpose, 
<br />
although I do not subscribe to this approach. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, although I agree that a taxonomy of information can 
<br />
bring more clarity into the discussions on the concept of 
<br />
information, I think that it cannot resolve the problem how 
<br />
to define information, so that all interested parties are 
<br />
satisfied. Or, I should speak for myself, I do not expect it 
<br />
can resolve the problem of the definition of information in 
<br />
a way which can help me to understand this concept.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Richard Emery &lt;rmemery&#64;earthlink.net&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Subject: [Fis] General Question  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To: fis&#64;listas.unizar.es
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Hello, FISers  I have general comment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I read almost every post on this forum, and I admire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   the quality of these contributions. (Pedro runs a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   fine shop!).  I’d contribute more if I actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   had something important to say that hasn’t already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   been said.  However, something continues to bug me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   about what exactly “information” is, what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   means exactly to living systems, and how exactly to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   interpret it. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Last year’s exquisite fight that broke out over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   the various definitions of information was a feast
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   to my eyes.  But it also left me confused.  One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   thing that bothered me was the lack of emphasis on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   differences between analog and digital information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   such as that embodied in a protein verses that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   encoded in a gene. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   With this in mind, along with numerous other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   concerns about exactly how to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   “information,” I am wondering if anyone here has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   attempted to build a taxonomic key to the “species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   of information.”  I think we need some kind of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   classification system. Ideally, it would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   dichotomous key that would differentiate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   hierarchically among “domains,” “kingdoms,”
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   “phyla,” “classes,” “orders,” etc. of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   information. (And hierarchy does seem to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   favored paradigm here on this forum).  This key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   would effectively become a cladistic tool, requiring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   a formalized approach to the problem of defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Is such notion of &quot;informational systematics&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   reasonable?  The FIS archives left behind from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   “Information War of 2005” should be very rich in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   concepts useful for developing such a taxonomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   key.  I am not well-enough informed about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   particulars of information to build this key, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   few of us have the time to devote to it.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   perhaps one of our graduate students would like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   take this on.  A thesis title might be something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   like “A hierarchical system for classifying the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   relative and specific meanings of information.” 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Could be fun project, and useful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   My best to all, Richard Emery
