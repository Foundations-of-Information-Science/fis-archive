Dear Arne,
<br />
<p>It must have been some kind of misunderstanding I believe.
<br />
In what you criticize, I agree. But that is not my views you criticize.
<br />
My intention is never to deny subjectivity. It is evident that we are 
<br />
subjective. My skepticism is towards Subjectivity.
<br />
As I told you, my view is that science and philosophy and culture in 
<br />
general are human, collective enterprises.
<br />
<p>There is no private language of one's own.
<br />
That makes it impossible to do any science or pursue any other scholarly 
<br />
discipline in total isolation and with no echo from the rest of the 
<br />
(human) world.
<br />
<p>As I am right now writing on that theme, I will be happy to offer you my 
<br />
text for your (Lists) critical reading.
<br />
More soon.
<br />
<p>With best wishes,
<br />
Gordana

<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear FIS-ers and Gordana,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this conversation is of interest to all of us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The stake at issue, I think, is as to whether information society (IS) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tacitly should accept the realist's dualist definition of a unary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe of observer-independent access to everyone - including the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realist's &quot;bucket model&quot; of knowledge acquisition, where the signal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acts as an information carrier between a presumed real &quot;reality&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the unreal mind of the observer. The IS must not be necessarily be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; locked in by the traditional realist view of physics - since we very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much operate on an abstract level - and therefore I think the time is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ripe to pave a more useful way around today's difficulties faced by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditional science. The other alternative open to an IS-community, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more appealing in my view, is the monist one, i.e., to consider a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe (rather PRIVERSE since it turns out to be personal) where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind and reality is considered as a whole where information is CREATED 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (for the sake of communication) in his mind/actuality and afterwards 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicated in models. Here the mathematical model is one available - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic and language another among several others often disciplinary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific. In that view the human mind impression is nothing else but a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model - i.e., the body's way of reacting to its environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is the main reason for this persistent dualist/monist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; battle taking place on this IS-list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In reply to your mail (below) Gordana I would say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you see the absurd situation you place yourself in when you try 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use a row of subjective statements and opinions in attempts to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defeat subjectivity - you then virtually cut off the branch you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sitting on. To discuss as to whether it is useful or not to use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term &quot;real&quot; as a category is one thing - but to defend realism by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of subjective arguments is plain self-contradiction. However this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a problem realists very seldom like to consider.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it could seem unfair that I, since I pleads for the SOA, can use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective arguments without involving in self-contradiction - but you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have better to see this as principal limitation; Namely the fact that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a human being can never be anything else but subjective. The fact that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can gather together in groups to present beliefs unfortunately do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not make us less subjective. ( I prefer the term &quot;subject-oriented&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the term subjective has become a word of abuse in classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science.)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You try to defend scientific realism, i.e., the dualist idea that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science must operate with two domains, one &quot;real&quot; and another &quot;unreal&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or mental) moreover claiming that &quot;reality&quot; is accessible and real. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the problem is, as I claim, that this question is undecidable - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this is a problematics that should be very familiar to a computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In defending relism you also defend scientific objectivity - which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; harder to define since it has become deeply muddled by all obscure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempts to defend it - but we can at least see it as the opposite of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjectivity. The line of demarcation is somewhat harder to draw - but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from an observational point of view one can say that the first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective (insider's view) is the only allowable in the SOA when the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person perspective (outsider's view) is prescribed by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object-oriented approach (OOA). However subjectivity has become a word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of abuse in the framework of OOA because of its emphasis on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimentation. Why?  Can you have a feeling for the wish for power? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Curiously enough all realists accept Einstein's way of subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning when he e.g. sits on quanta or uses elevators travelling at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the speed of light - surprisingly enough even he himself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OOA was developed during the scientific revolution is defined by its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimental methodology (thus involving observation) and succeeding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modelling (for the sake of communication). Since then the physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment has become the hallmark of science - if you cannot present 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an experimental &quot;proof&quot; you are non-scientific - i.e., you resort to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plain belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the experimental way of deciding ... that is, if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimentally can show something this experiment can be used to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convince other people that you claim is correct - or at least useful. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However the test of usefulness is prediction - not consent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now when you and Andrei admit you are unable to present a proof of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;realness&quot; of reality you are in trouble - because physics has no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means to present such a proof (Goedel's 2^nd see below). Then you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directed make a decision in this matter by pure belief - and in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deed you are subjective - which Andrei also admits - but this is also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that you are non-objective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is a lot of questions that are undecidable by experiment - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact all questions are dependent on the consent of ostentation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which is the basis of language) - and in this situation we must also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rely on consensus. However consensus is a subjective group decision. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore you cannot rely on consensus to dismiss subjectivity - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without serious self-contradiction. On the other hand a subjectivist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can dismiss objectivity without running into self-contradiction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because a consensual decision is a legal one in his framework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is the question of real so important? Well, if the real/unreal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dichotomy is experimentally undecidable (and I can see a consensus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here) then the realist's dualist way of operating with two different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domains is possibly bewildering and misleading - and definitely a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter of plain belief. In fact I cannot see why the science of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics should uphold an undecidable distinction - then we are just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once more trying to prove the existence of God. As well  doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-science to my view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So Gornada if you claim your statements are non-subjective, i.e., 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective I need better arguments  indeed - as a matter of fact I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not think you can even reach consensus about most of your statements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below. Andrei, on the other hand is better off, since he has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consensual back-up when claiming the world is &quot;real&quot; - by, as already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said, the fact this is a subjective group decision, and then he can at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least redefine a &quot;subjective group decision&quot; into an &quot;objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision&quot; and plead for the belief of majority.  However this do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make his (or his groups) point of view True - because he is this deed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unable to find a truth template. His group's point of view might not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even be useful in the long run. Today's conceptual difficulties of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science indicates that we are facing this is very situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One way to convince me Gordana is to solve the &quot;realist's dilemma&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier presented by me - and you should, as a computer scientist, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really be in the position to assimilate this dilemma.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Below some of my comment marked AAAA on your recent mail:                
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think it can be a new very productive paradigm now when one can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; afford to treat those processes individually so and not anonymize them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making simplifying &gt;assumption that they in average are the same. We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might now start to be interested in what they do when they keep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual behaviors and what is even more &gt;important individual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strategies - that might be especially relevant in biological systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: What paradigm?  To treat the &quot;real&quot; reality as a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual &quot;real&quot; agents - and considering a stone as a &quot;real&quot; agent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well? I cannot see how you can escape the problem of the human's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;limited&quot; capacity of observation that way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;To me, that is the way to most naturally integrate the observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: To become monist is really &quot;observer-integrating&quot; - Bohm and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others calls it holism. But you need to leave the observer-position of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicist's to consider human knowing as well - and that the build-up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of human knowing that has another basis but observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think that Arnes assumption that the observer somehow innocently on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her own approaches the world and thus gets her own personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impressions or &gt;measurement results or sensory data from the world - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is totally impossible!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: This is your belief evidently. Would you then be so kind to tell 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me then in what way you think a newly born child approaches the &quot;world&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As an individual you approach the world with the conglomerate of tools 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and theories that are materialization of the collective enterprise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: I'll repeat the foregoing question here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So you are in the loop, where you may just contribute with n+1st 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt to approach THE SAME WORLD. And that is very essential.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: Agree but THIS SAME WORD IS NOT REAL - IT IS CONCEPTUAL - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mirroring the situation we use THE SAME NAMES  appointing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena of our experience. To find out that all people PROBABLY 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refer to the same sort of REALITY - is a act of mature consideration 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that take place late in life and education - to find out that this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REALITY only can be described as a &quot;body&quot; of stability requires that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one leaves the realist's (way) system of speaking. THIS IS A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CONSEQUENCE OF GOEDEL'S SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM - YOU CANNOT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PROVE OR DISPROVE A SYSTEM FROM WITHIN. Accordingly it seems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable that that the insight REALITY=STABILITY does not come until 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you dare to leave the realist's way of thinking eventually by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questioning its fundaments.  This state of mature thinking is bound to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen even at a later stage in life - however it seems most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists do not even bother.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The world is the same during this short period of time we are here on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earth. Otherwise, no science, and no human communication would ever be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible without &gt;the existence of that fast point - constantly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing and essentially stable physical world. I am realist, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unusual for a physicist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: This sounds very dogmatic to me - an attitude one often find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among realists unfortunately. You have to dare to question the basis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our own realistic thinking - and then you will see the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistencies of this framework hopefully. Otherwise you have to put 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your trust in Goedel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What I claim is that *you* *don't even see without the help from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others. *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA:  Can the newly born baby see or not? Of course I can see without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the help of others - don't you think a bat sees? I claim I can even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulate thoughts as newly born - well even explicate myself without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the help of others. We usually cry when we are newly born - we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicate a feeling (feel) - don't you think so? What I cannot do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however is to COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS WITHOUT THEIR HELP - but this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite a different matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *&gt;Do you remember the first labs in microscopy? You have to find and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;see&quot; an object say an eye of a fly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But nearly everybody in the class finds whatever spurious picture it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be there - a grain of dust, anything, until the teacher helps us 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see the right thing we are &gt;supposed to see. The moral of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story is: nothing like subjective relation of a person with a world is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible, and even if it would be possible that single person &gt;without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any relationship to the rest of humanity would be an autist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: It seem me as a rushed conclusion.  To me this story says that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you have a theory (the &quot;right&quot; theory?) you cannot perceive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you think your teacher perceives. From where did the teacher get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his theory? Does he has access to the truth bu any means? Well to me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is a lesson in the theory-laden-ness of perception - which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually the fundamental cause of human incapacity to decide what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real from unreal.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This summer I am writing my PhD thesis on information semantics (which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is characterized as computer science but is a mix with theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science and &gt;philosophy) , which also includes some of my papers on

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his own premises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AAAA: Well at least something we can agree upon - but I sincerely

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope you dare to test you own premises.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Dear Andrei and Arne,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I think it can be a new very productive paradigm now when one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     afford to treat those processes individually so and not anonymize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     them making simplifying assumption that they in average are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     same. We might now start to be interested in what they do when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     they keep individual behaviors and what is even more important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     individual strategies - that might be especially relevant in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     biological systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     To me, that is the way to most naturally integrate the observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I think that Arnes assumption that the observer somehow innocently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     on her own approaches the world and thus gets her own personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     impressions or measurement results or sensory data from the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     - that is totally impossible!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As an individual you approach the world with the conglomerate of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     tools and theories that are materialization of the collective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     enterprise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So you are in the loop, where you may just contribute with n+1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     attempt to approach THE SAME WORLD. And that is very essential.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The world is the same during this short period of time we are here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     on earth. Otherwise, no science, and no human communication would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ever be possible without the existence of that fast point -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     constantly existing and essentially stable physical world. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     realist, not unusual for a physicist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What I claim is that *you* *don't even see without the help from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *Do you remember the first labs in microscopy? You have to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and &quot;see&quot; an object say an eye of a fly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     But nearly everybody in the class finds whatever spurious picture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     it might be there - a grain of dust, anything, until the teacher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     helps us to see the right thing we are supposed to see. The moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of this story is: nothing like subjective relation of a person
