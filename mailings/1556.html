<p>
Dear Colleagues,
<br />
Please forgive me for intruding on this discussion with a personal note 
<br />
that is also a plea for assistance. If you feel that off-topic mailings are 
<br />
inappropriate, delete immediately. The situation is a real-life example of 
<br />
science and politics, information transfer, public perceptions of 
<br />
scientific research, and might stir those of you, expecially in 
<br />
bio-information/genetics to weigh in. That is my only motive for intruding. 
<br />
Please read on.
<br />
<p>The artist Steve Kurtz interviewed and was offered a tenure track position
<br />
here at The University of Michigan School of Art &amp; Design a couple of years 
<br />
ago.  He accepted a position at the University of Buffalo in order to work 
<br />
with a colleague there, and is presently in the pincers of the Patriot Act, 
<br />
as described so heartbreakingly below. I am not sending this along to you 
<br />
simply to share my fear, anger, and righteous indignation but in hopes that 
<br />
you might have an idea, through your various connections with life 
<br />
sciences, as to how we might contribute to bringing an element of reason to 
<br />
this absurd drama.  I loathe the feeling of powerlessness I experience in 
<br />
the face of events like this, and must do something besides feel sypathetic.
<br />
<p>Steve struck me as an entirely rational, intelligent, and humane
<br />
individual, working at the interstices of art and science, by no means a 
<br />
wacko deliberately provoking the authorities. His work with genetics long 
<br />
predates John Ashcroft and bio-terrorism paranoia.
<br />
<p>I wonder if anyone of your acquaintances might be moved to contact the
<br />
defense team and offer their services as an expert witness?  Anything. As I
<br />
see it, this could easily be happening to a colleague right here in Ann
<br />
Arbor. Steve might easily be a member of this list serve.  If he were, what 
<br />
would I be doing?
<br />
<p>Please read on, especially the background information at the end that
<br />
describes how these bizarre events unfolded at the bedside of Steve's 
<br />
deceased wife.
<br />
<p>Thanks,
<br />
Jim

Subject: ARTISTS SUBPOENAED IN USA PATRIOT ACT CASE
<br />
<p>June 2, 2004						
<br />
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<br />
<p>Contact: Beatriz da Costa, mailto:media&#64;caedefensefund.org
<br />
<p>ARTISTS SUBPOENAED IN USA PATRIOT ACT CASE
<br />
Feds STILL unable to distinguish art from bioterrorism
<br />
Grand jury to convene June 15
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HELP URGENTLY NEEDED - SEE BELOW
<br />
<p>Three artists have been served subpoenas to appear before a federal
<br />
grand jury that will consider bioterrorism charges against a
<br />
university professor whose art involves the use of simple biology
<br />
equipment.
<br />
<p>The subpoenas are the latest installment in a bizarre investigation
<br />
in which members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force have mistaken an
<br />
art project for a biological weapons laboratory (see end for
<br />
background). While most observers have assumed that the Task Force
<br />
would realize the absurd error of its initial investigation of Steve
<br />
Kurtz, the subpoenas indicate that the feds have instead chosen to
<br />
press their &quot;case&quot; against the baffled professor.
<br />
<p>Two of the subpoenaed artists--Beatriz da Costa and Steve Barnes--are,
<br />
like Kurtz, members of the internationally-acclaimed Critical Art
<br />
Ensemble (CAE), an artists' collective that produces artwork to
<br />
educate the public about the politics of biotechnology. They were
<br />
served the subpoenas by federal agents who tailed them to an art show
<br />
at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The third artist,
<br />
Paul Vanouse, is, like Kurtz, an art professor at the University at
<br />
Buffalo. He has worked with CAE in the past.
<br />
<p>The artists involved are at a loss to explain the increasingly bizarre
<br />
case. &quot;I have no idea why they're continuing (to investigate),&quot; said
<br />
Beatriz da Costa, one of those subpoenaed. &quot;It was shocking that this
<br />
investigation was ever launched. That it is continuing is positively
<br />
frightening, and shows how vulnerable the PATRIOT Act has made freedom
<br />
of speech in this country.&quot; Da Costa is an art professor at the
<br />
University of California at Irvine.
<br />
<p>According to the subpoenas, the FBI is seeking charges under Section
<br />
175 of the US Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which has
<br />
been expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act. As expanded, this law prohibits
<br />
the possession of &quot;any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system&quot;
<br />
without the justification of &quot;prophylactic, protective, bona fide
<br />
research, or other peaceful purpose.&quot; (See
<br />
<a href="../../www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/175.html">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/175.html</a> for the 1989 law and
<br />
<a href="../../www.ehrs.upenn.edu/protocols/patriot/sec817.html">http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/protocols/patriot/sec817.html</a> for its USA
<br />
PATRIOT Act expansion.)
<br />
<p>Even under the expanded powers of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is difficult
<br />
to understand how anyone could view CAE's art as anything other than a
<br />
&quot;peaceful purpose.&quot; The equipment seized by the FBI consisted mainly of
<br />
CAE's most recent project, a mobile DNA extraction laboratory to test
<br />
store-bought food for possible contamination by genetically modified
<br />
grains and organisms; such equipment can be found in any university's
<br />
basic biology lab and even in many high schools (see &quot;Lab Tour&quot; at
<br />
<a href="../../www.critical-art.net/biotech/free/default.htm">http://www.critical-art.net/biotech/free/</a> for more details).
<br />
<p>The grand jury in the case is scheduled to convene June 15 in Buffalo,
<br />
New York. Here, the jury will decide whether or not to indict Steve
<br />
Kurtz on the charges brought by the FBI. A protest is being planned at
<br />
9 a.m. on June 15 outside the courthouse at 138 Delaware Ave. in
<br />
Buffalo.
<br />
<p>HELP NEEDED
<br />
<p>Financial donations:
<br />
The CAE Defense Fund has so far received over 200 donations in amounts
<br />
ranging from $5 to $400. This is a wonderful outpouring of sympathy,
<br />
but a drop in the bucket compared to the potential costs of the case.
<br />
To make a donation, please visit <a href="../../www.caedefensefund.org/default.htm">http://www.caedefensefund.org/</a>
<br />
<p>Letters of support:
<br />
Letters and petitions of support from biologists, artists, and others,
<br />
especially those in positions of responsibility at prominent
<br />
institutions or companies, could be very useful. See
<br />
<a href="../../www.caedefensefund.org/default.htm">http://www.caedefensefund.org/</a> for a sample letter of support.
<br />
<p>Legal offers and letters of support:
<br />
If you are a lawyer, offers of pro bono support or offers to write
<br />
amicus briefs would be very helpful.
<br />
<p>BACKGROUND
<br />
<p>Early morning of May 11, Steve Kurtz awoke to find his wife, Hope,
<br />
dead of a cardiac arrest. Kurtz called 911. The police arrived and,
<br />
after stumbling across test tubes and petri dishes Kurtz was using
<br />
in a current artwork, called in the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
<br />
<p>Soon agents from the Task Force and FBI detained Kurtz, cordoned off
<br />
the entire block around his house, and later impounded Kurtz's
<br />
computers, manuscripts, books, equipment, and even his wife's body for
<br />
further analysis. The Buffalo Health Department condemned the house as
<br />
a health risk.
<br />
<p>Only after the Commissioner of Public Health for New York State had
<br />
tested samples from the home and announced there was no public safety
<br />
threat was Kurtz able to return home and recover his wife's body. Yet
<br />
the FBI would not release the impounded materials, which included
<br />
artwork for an upcoming exhibition at the Massachusetts Museum of
<br />
Contemporary Art.
<br />
<p>While most observers assumed the Task Force would realize that its
<br />
initial investigation of Steve Kurtz was a terrible mistake, the
<br />
subpoenas indicate that the feds have instead chosen to press their
<br />
&quot;case&quot; against Kurtz and possibly others.
