                <p>
                    Dear Friend,
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;I am the Wife the of Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide who needs assistance and
                    <br />
                    wanting to transfer thirty million dollars in US Currency ($30,000,000.00)
                    <br />
                    to a bank account.The recently deposed Haitian President.
                    <br />
                    In the past 2 years, I have employed very diligent bureaucratic means
                    <br />
                    to divorce ($30,000,000.00) (Thirty Million, U. S.Dollars) from the external
                    <br />
                    affairs operation of the Federal Government of my country - in Malaysia and South Africa.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    My strategic position as the First Lady in the Government of my country and
                    <br />
                    my relationship with corresponding key officials in the Governments of
                    <br />
                    South East Asia and Europe has afforded me the required Intergovernmental
                    <br />
                    funds transfer connections as well as the know-how that will ensure the success
                    <br />
                    of an operation of this sizes.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    For the security of my family's future and safety, I have structured the
                    <br />
                    transfer of the ($30,000,000.00) to
                    <br />
                    conform to the highest standard of International Banking Regulations
                    <br />
                    and Financial Laws, Conversely, I require strictly, a foreign company duly
                    <br />
                    registered and verifiable as having conformed to the basic operating
                    <br />
                    and equity standards in its area of domicile, to receive the
                    <br />
                    ($30,000,000.00).
                    <br />
                <p>Your role, in the above regard, will be to act as the beneficiary of
                    <br />
                    the funds in question, as my present Location precludes me from legal
                    <br />
                    association with this money. You must however, note that this transfer
                    <br />
                    will be guided by certain express provisions designed to ensure that your
                    <br />
                    receipt of the above stated sum does not place me at a disadvantage or
                    <br />
                    undermine my ability to receive my portion of the ($30,000,000.00). Firstly,
                    <br />
                    the remittance of the money into your nominated account will be subject to
                    <br />
                    Condition Precedent. That is, the crediting of your nominated account with the
                    <br />
                    above stated funds will be conditional and subject to a post dated credit
                    <br />
                    confirmation date which you will comply. The postdating will allow my Lawyer
                    <br />
                    adequate time to arrive in your country to set up the proper fund receipt
                    <br />
                    mechanism for our share of the ($30,000,000.00)
                    <br />
                <p>Finally, I am constrained by time in the execution of the above stated
                    <br />
                    transfer due to My husband and i's present condition under Assylum,
                    <br />
                    therefore your immediate response in concession to the nature,requirement
                    <br />
                    and conditions for the successful completion of this transfer,
                    <br />
                    will be highly appreciated.
