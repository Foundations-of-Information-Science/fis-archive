Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>I understand Landauer’s insight not as an analysis of the logical 
<br />
structure of information, nor of its ubiquitous utility throughout human 
<br />
endeavors, but rather as a more precise description of the mechanisms 
<br />
for storage and transmission of information. According to Landauer, and 
<br />
I think he was right about this, information is exclusively stored in 
<br />
the configuration of physical objects,.and transmitted only by material 
<br />
entities. So, for example, the energy configuration of a simple bi-level 
<br />
atom would contain a single bit of information, represented by zero, 
<br />
say, in its ground configuration, and by one in its excited level. Of 
<br />
course the physical configuration of the atom’s nucleus, made up of 
<br />
protons and neutrons, must also contain additional information, ignored 
<br />
in this instance. And we know that protons and neutrons are themselves 
<br />
composed of quarks, whose physical configuration must also contain more 
<br />
information. And, as far as we know, those quarks may be constituted by 
<br />
some structure of strings, with even more information, and so on.
<br />
I also understand Landauer to tell us that information is transmitted 
<br />
from one thing to another only by physical objects, all of which are 
<br />
composed of energetic quanta. As, for instance, sending information on a 
<br />
telegraph line by a series of electrical impulses, each of which 
<br />
contains many electrons. I know of no reason to suppose that the 
<br />
information any person holds and exploits, even about mathematics, is 
<br />
not stored and transmitted physically, as Landauer has said.
<br />
Jerry wrote that “mathematics is often deemed as abstraction, (so) 
<br />
mathematical information is often deemed as abstract.” But, it is the 
<br />
brain cells and synaptic connections, their chemical and electrical 
<br />
configuration and signal processing, which alone permits us to employ 
<br />
mathematics. Clearly, traumatic injury to the brain (or death, even) can 
<br />
destroy a person’s mathematical facility. I suppose neuroscientists 
<br />
today may even be able to locate those specific areas of the brain that 
<br />
process mathematical thoughts.
<br />
I would say that those who might claim that physics is merely applied 
<br />
mathematics, that it lacks any self standing domain, are certainly 
<br />
mistaken. Those of us who are physical scientists recognize that our 
<br />
models of the physical world must always be validated by tangible 
<br />
observations in controlled experiments. That, I believe, distinguishes 
<br />
the physical sciences from pure mathematics. I have yet to meet the 
<br />
chemist, biologist, geologist, paleontologist, astronomer, or physicist 
<br />
who seeks to treat matter itself as a disembodied abstract entity. 
<br />
Landauer certainly didn’t do that, and the rest of us, also, I believe, 
<br />
clearly see the difference between a mathematical model of the physical 
<br />
world, and the world itself. Because we carefully observe that world in 
<br />
our experiments.
<br />
Cordially,
<br />
<p>Michael Devereux
