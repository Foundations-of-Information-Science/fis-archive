<p>&quot;I am not clear why you think it is &quot;crucial&quot; to retain the term
<br />
&quot;information&quot; for only the cases in which there is a semantic
<br />
interpretation.&quot;
<br />
-------------------
<br />
<p>I guess that the way we choose to use words is a function of our
<br />
background assumptions and our aims, so let me explain mine.
<br />
<p>First, I start from a premise of realism. I believe the world would
<br />
exist more or less as it is, even if I were not a part of it. I believe
<br />
the moon is there even when I am not looking. I believe the moon would
<br />
still be there, even if the entire human race were exterminated. In the
<br />
same way, I believe bacteria exist and go about their business quite
<br />
independently of my or our observations of them. One aspect of that
<br />
business is the use of information. So, this is information in an
<br />
objective sense, where &quot;objective&quot; means independent of outside
<br />
observation.
<br />
<p>As for my aims, I wish to understand how something like a bacterium came
<br />
to be within the wider context of cosmic evolution. In order to achieve
<br />
this, we need a story about how structuration occurred before the origin
<br />
of life, and then we need a story about how life originated out of
<br />
nonliving structures and processes.  Certainly, I agree with you that
<br />
&quot;negentropy&quot; is a useful concept for describing both of these
<br />
explananda---but negentropy can be adequately articulated within the
<br />
framework of statistical mechanics. There is no necessity for an
<br />
information-theoretic overlay (I agree with K.G. Denbigh on this point).
<br />
<p>So, in short, if my goal is to understand cosmic evolution
<br />
(structuration) up to the origin of life, why would I need to introduce
<br />
the concept of information? Of course, one can do so if one likes, but
<br />
only in the subjective sense that presupposes us as observers. This only
<br />
confuses matters. And anyway, there is no necessity for doing so. I
<br />
don't see how it helps out in any way. It only introduces needless
<br />
confusion. And if it is not needed, then by Ockham's razor we ought to
<br />
get rid of it.
<br />
<p>As for the origin of life, well that is the great problem that I think
<br />
we currently have little idea how to attack.  But if you are prepared to
<br />
grant me that there is a sui generis dynamics of life---however it may
<br />
have arisen and whatever its essential nature may be---at least on that
<br />
assumption we can begin to see how objective information use came into
<br />
being. And that is, or should be, the main goal, in my opinion.
<br />
<p>So, once this distinction between pre-living and living physics is
<br />
granted, then it makes sense to restrict the concept of information (in
<br />
the objective sense) to the living side of the divide. If we do this,
<br />
then we should be able to agree to use the word &quot;information&quot; in a way
<br />
that always implies a semantic component (as ordinary usage also
<br />
sanctions).  That is, there is &quot;structure&quot; on one side of the divide,
<br />
and &quot;structure that is meaningful for a cognitive agent&quot; (i.e.,
<br />
information) on the other side of the divide.
<br />
<p>Given this scenario, if our aim is to understand how WE got here, then
<br />
we need to construct a story that does not build us into the
<br />
foundations. Or at least, one needs to do that if one is a realist . . .
<br />
