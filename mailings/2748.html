Yes, Igor, I agree that we participate in two layers and with different
<br />
capacities to differentiate (e.g., rationally). Our (and the politicians')
<br />
reflexive capacities to communicate with a double (or even more complex)
<br />
hermeneutics are limiting the capacity of the social system to process
<br />
complexity. The remaining uncertainty will remain unresolved, and thus the
<br />
system of inter-human communications is failure-prone. One can expect it to
<br />
produce unintended consequences. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I don't share your optimism about experts who would be able to leave this
<br />
human condition behind them. It is like Marx's dream of a state of freedom.
<br />
:-)

With best wishes,

<p><p>Dear Pedro
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
regarding social openness:  &quot;very tenuous rumor may destroy an entire
<br />
company, or put  a sector on its knees.. &quot; This can only happen if there is
<br />
a fundamental reason for the company or the sector to get into trouble (e.g.
<br />
time before the collapse the WorldCom had been in financial troubles but was
<br />
corrupting its accounting data to hide it). Therefore, a rumor is only a
<br />
trigger, and if it is &quot;rumor&quot; only, nothing will happen to the system. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When I refer to {biological  {sociocultural }} constraints in understanding
<br />
and managing complexity I primarily have in mind the nature of constraints
<br />
as such, in terms that certain things cannot or are not likely to happen
<br />
under their influence. For example,  our brains cannot handle more than 3 or
<br />
4 variables at one time and grasp their causative interrelations, so we have
<br />
a natural heuristic process that cuts trough the &quot;many&quot; and reduces it to
<br />
few. This results in oversimplification of the reality and overemphasizing
<br />
of the variables that were not left out. A lot political and economic
<br />
reasoning suffers from that bias. Mathematical procedures and modeling can
<br />
help us with this biological constraint but math, unfortunately, did not
<br />
prove itself yet to be helpful to deal complex social problems. Artificial
<br />
societies may be a hopeful way, but this is yet to be seen.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Another biological constraint on our capacity to manage complex social
<br />
reality is that we intermittently use rational procedures and emotions, so a
<br />
situation which may be solved by an analytic process can erupt in conflict
<br />
only because certain words have been uttered or misinterpreted, which steers
<br />
the whole interaction and the problem solving process in a different
<br />
direction. This biological trait is only partially controlled by the culture
<br />
at the next integrative level, trough norms and rules of behavior
<br />
(institutions).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The impact of sociocultural constraints on managing complexity is evident
<br />
form my last example on managing the energy sector: there is no reason as
<br />
why the energy sector could not be managed in a fully planned and rational
<br />
way by a group of experts who would optimize the production and transmission
<br />
processes. Did we need the market process to send the spacecraft to the Moon
<br />
or it was a large-scale project carefully managed for years before it
<br />
succeeded? Or, is the carbon trading the best response to climate change
<br />
problem? However, the primacy of markets is part of our dominant worldview,
<br />
so we have the propensity to exclude other options that may do the job
<br />
better or with less uncertainty. So I have the feeling that as we continue
<br />
to build more socio-economic complexity our biological and cultral
<br />
capabilities to manage it are lagging seriously behind.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The best
<br />
Igor

<br />
<p>Dear Igor and colleagues,
<br />
<p><p><p>I have the impression that there is an agreement about the existence of
<br />
biological and sociocultural constraints that impact on our ability to
<br />
understand and manage socioeconomic complexity. These constraints are
<br />
organized  hierarchically, as Stan puts it, {biological  {sociocultural }}. 
<br />
<p><p>I would agree that this is the way to organize our explanations. But
<br />
dynamically the real world is open at all levels: very simple amplification
<br />
or feed forward processes would produce phenomena capable of escalating
<br />
levels and percolate around (e.g., minuscule oxidation-combustion phenomena
<br />
initiating fires that scorch ecosystems, regions). Socially there is even
<br />
more &quot;openness&quot;: a very tenuous rumor may destroy an entire company, or put
<br />
a sector on its knees... Arguing logically about those hierarchical schemes
<br />
may be interesting only for semi-closed, &quot;capsule&quot; like entities, but not
<br />
really for say (individuals (cities (countries)))...  My contention is that
<br />
we should produce a new way of thinking going beyond that classical
<br />
systemic, non-informational view.
<br />
<p><p><p>&nbsp;To some extent, it may be a sign of diminishing returns to complexity in
<br />
problem solving that Joe addressed in his book &quot;The collapse of complex
<br />
societies&quot;... If we cannot manage the energy sector to serve certain social
<br />
and economic goals, how can we hope to be able to manage more complex
<br />
situations like the climate change, poverty reduction and population growth
<br />
in the South? 
<br />
Did we reach the limits (cognitive and cultural) to manage our complex
<br />
world?
<br />
<p><p>After the industrial revolution, on average every passing generation (say
<br />
each 30 years) has doubled both the material and the immaterial basis of
<br />
societies:  social wealth, income, accumulated knowledge, scientific fields,
<br />
technological development, social complexity... provided the environment
<br />
could withstand, maybe the process of generational doubling would continue
<br />
around almost indefinitely, or maybe not! Euristic visions like those
<br />
mentioned by Igor on energy policies by the UE or the US have been the usual
<br />
and only tool during all previous epochs: the case is whether after some
<br />
critical threshold human societies cannot keep their complexity any
<br />
longer... Joe might agree on the &quot;necessary&quot; collapse of complex societies.
<br />
<p><p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
