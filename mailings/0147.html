(Bob's splendid contribution has already motivated an answer. Here it
<br />
is--coming from GOTT&#64;UFBA.BR Gottfried Stockinger. It could not go directly
<br />
into the net because its email address was new. The same has happened these
<br />
weeks with several messages... please, before sending messages from other
<br />
email addresses you have to UNSUBSCRIBE the old one. Probably I will be
<br />
able to do that from here quite soon as I am trying to get some permanent
<br />
help. I will inform about that ----Pedro)
<br />
<p>------------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>from GOTT&#64;UFBA.BR Gottfried Stockinger:
<br />
<p><p>I would like to introduce my approach to social information in discussion
<br />
with Bob Artigiani%s contribution on the &quot;nature of social information&quot;.
<br />
<p>He wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If information is the measure of reduced uncertainty an observer has about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the world, then social information is the measure of a society*s reduced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty.
</em><br />
<p>In summa, I. is here used as a measure of order (certainty of patterns of
<br />
behaviour), from the point of view of an observer.  That means, that
<br />
information (knowledge about order) decreases in case of social change
<br />
(not-order), producing uncertainty (for the observer of a system).
<br />
But: we know, that systems for themselfes increase their information
<br />
(knowledge about themselves) in case of disorder and uncertainty detected,
<br />
even if an observer does not realize that increased information flow. This
<br />
&quot;internal&quot; information does, in the case mentioned, deal more with
<br />
change-topics, and less with order-topics. Information works here as the
<br />
difference that makes the difference. In communication with or about this
<br />
differences, the system can self-organize.
<br />
To connect with Artigiani, we may introduce an &quot;inner&quot; observer, a &quot;self&quot;,
<br />
that constitutes something like an information processor within the
<br />
system%s boundaries.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;observation is simply interaction...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is a record or trace left of an interaction, however,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only when some structure can be noticeably changed as a result of a flow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;across a frontier.
</em><br />
<p>I did not really catch this idea, may you clearify it? Do you say, that
<br />
interaction (observation) creates a difference, a change?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;... societies also store information in rituals and rites,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social roles and institutions, languages and myths.
</em><br />
<p>Rituals, roles etc. are &quot;constructed&quot;, are made of information, in
<br />
permanent communication processes. The roles etc. are not permanent, they
<br />
change due to social questioning by communication. So I think one should
<br />
focus the c-process, and how it builds and deconstructs social
<br />
institutions, roles etc., which get almost irrelevant, when change ocurrs
<br />
rapidly (see the role of a lover in President Clinton%s case(s). In  spite
<br />
of all the information-pressure, the traditonal role-definitions were
<br />
broken, the change to a less puritan collective mentality occured).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Recording interactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the world in, e.g., social roles means that it is changed human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behaviors which store social information.
</em><br />
<p>Question: Human behaviors = culture (?)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;... the structure of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-organized society is itself the embodiment of social information, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the social structure remembers , ...., how much the group*s uncertainty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about a transformed environment was reduced.
</em><br />
<p>You say, that social structure is built of routines (rituals, roles,
<br />
institutions etc), as social &quot;facts&quot;. I dont disagree, but I think it%s
<br />
worth to take look on the construction of this &quot;routines&quot; or &quot;patterns&quot;
<br />
themselves. They dont decompose in &quot;smaller&quot; parts of patterns, but in
<br />
communication-acts. Seen as such, sociological theory is more likely to be
<br />
connected to information-theory, and therefore to fis-topics. But that%s
<br />
not the only advantage: to look at society as composed by c-acts and not by
<br />
individuals or persons, it gets easier to detect its new quality different
<br />
from the psicological level.
<br />
In that perception, humans do not belong to social systems, but to its
<br />
environment. They &quot;irritate&quot; the system constantly, as they are
<br />
&quot;spontaneaus&quot; and get &quot;out of the role&quot;, &quot;subvert institutions&quot; and do
<br />
things not &quot;agreed&quot; with society.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Societies self-organize when the number of human interactions pass a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;threshold and, suddenly, become interconnected wholes greater than the sum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of their parts.  This is not mystical, for if synergies between people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;release energy into an environment which has effects disproportional to
</em><br />
its
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causes, feedback from the environment *selects* the whole.  Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generated bottom-up by interacting people, once organized societies have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;top-down effects on their constituents.
</em><br />
<p>The synergies are produced by the system, right? They don%t belong to the
<br />
people, but to their interactions. If interaction stops, the system
<br />
collapses. So, the energy you mentioned is something like an
<br />
information-energy, produced in interaction.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The whole sustains itself by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recording what it, the society, knows about the world.  That cannot be
</em><br />
done
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the brains and bodies of people, for then we would have lots of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information about yous and mes but no information about the us shared in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;common.
</em><br />
<p>The &quot;us&quot;, society, the &quot;whole&quot; has therefore to be explained. As you say,
<br />
that cannot be done by explaining brains  and bodies of people.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;People learn how to play social roles as members of societies, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assimilating the information stored in their structures.  Social roles are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communicated to people, in the first instance, by reenactments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;successful collective enterprises, typically dances or games, which, over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time, become rituals and rites.
</em><br />
<p>I dont think that information is just assimilated. I. acts, is active, has
<br />
energy, which transforms values and behaviours. Its the &quot;matter&quot; society is
<br />
made of.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if individuals varied their behavior they sometime found more
</em><br />
effective
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ways to exploit nature, and the increased flow of resources would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;required more specialized roles and more intimate relations to process.
</em><br />
<p>Variation of behaviour ocurrs  constantly, but not all variations are
<br />
&quot;selected&quot; for further use. Most of them are neglected, they dont
<br />
&quot;survive&quot;, they are not &quot;fit&quot;. As you say: just sometimes&quot; more effective
<br />
ways are found. What happens to variations not selected. Do they go lost?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maps of the behaviors that map the world, VEMs are quintessential social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information.  Because they are not records of personal experiences, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be communicated in terms of sensations of pleasure and pain, VEMs are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new kinds of information.
</em><br />
<p>Values, Ethics, Morals have certainly marked an achievement in societies
<br />
evolution. But also, they get in conflict with new lifestiles emerging
<br />
round the world. There does not exist (any more) a  fixed VEM-structure to
<br />
&quot;hold together&quot; society. Their orders and commands do not function any
<br />
more, but even so societies dont get &quot;worse&quot; and world wars are not in
<br />
sight. The &quot;new&quot; world is rather &quot;held together&quot; by recognition of VEM%s
<br />
differences than by obeying them. This &quot;recognition&quot; is not a value, but a
<br />
product of a complex mass-communication process, &quot;steered&quot; by
<br />
information-energy.
<br />
Or, as you say:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When communication systems improve, social systems can access
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many more states, process different kinds of flows, and make more
</em><br />
efficient
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use of resources.
</em><br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Social information should not be reified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and does not DO anything.
</em><br />
<p>I think it acts, it &quot;works&quot;, it is the energy for constructing society.
