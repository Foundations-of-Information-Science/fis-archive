<p>
.. and now I will try to connect with Michael's ideas:
<br />
<p>(dearly thanking him for both the personal acknowledgement and for the
<br />
dedication to compose his thoughtful essay in these hectic days of course
<br />
termination)
<br />
<p>Wouldn't the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset find quite interesting
<br />
your piece? I mean, he strongly advocated during the 20's 304s and 40's
<br />
about what he called &quot;perspectivism&quot; --the impossibility of any global
<br />
comprehension by any observer, and of course the impossibility of any
<br />
subsequent complete &quot;rationalistic&quot; logical account. Unfortunately the
<br />
circle of Spanish intellectuals and philosophers following him was more
<br />
humanistic and literary than scientifically inclined. And there were not
<br />
enough English translations of all his books (unfortunately his scientific
<br />
doctrine was disseminated among quite a few of them). You have developed
<br />
ideas, rather germane to his, addressed from a more rigorous scientific
<br />
background, perhaps physically inclined (this is precisely the interesting
<br />
thing!). My own way (rather biological) to understand this matter was the
<br />
principle of &quot;limited prehension&quot;, sketched in the BioSystems issue to
<br />
appear.
<br />
<p>Sorry for the long intro--the point is that, joining Deborah Conrad in the
<br />
sense that your principle of &quot;philosophical relativity&quot; will immediately be
<br />
misinterpreted as another defense of &quot;relativism&quot;, I take the freedom to
<br />
suggest the inclusion of it, as a central scientific-theoretical tool,
<br />
within the perspectivistic framework. But I do not know wether
<br />
&quot;perspectivism&quot; nowadays is suitable as a global term for philosophers,
<br />
perhaps it could be even worse than relativism.
<br />
<p>The final advocation of yours as a principle of tolerance, is shared. And
<br />
it gives a nice cue to connect with previous discussions--assuming that the
<br />
systems of the sciences is working as a global brain, as a nervous system
<br />
of sorts for the sake of the whole social organism. Then my little
<br />
controversial question is this: INDIFFERENCE, lack of a real &quot;soul&quot; in the
<br />
nervous system of the sciences, instead of tolerance, could be the central
<br />
malady afflicting our sci. system. Sadly, specialized sciences have worked
<br />
as power-focused instruments, without sufficent concern for the sentient
<br />
being. The story of nuclear physcis is quite eloquent. Lewis Mumford put it
<br />
quite forcefully: the historical alliance between industrialists,
<br />
developers, politicians, the military, and scientists... has become the
<br />
blindest and most dangerous social experiment ever.
<br />
<p>best greetings
<br />
