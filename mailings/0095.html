Dear Koichiro,
<br />
<p>sorry for puting Werner's words in your mouth (or mail!), but as we 
<br />
are all inter-related, what we think and say is in some way what 
<br />
others have thought and said (or not-thought, not-said).
<br />
One way of getting rid of Newtonian (metaphysical) time was 
<br />
Heideggers conception of the human way of being as being in (or _as_) 
<br />
time in a radically different way as all other things (we know of) 
<br />
are, i.e. as being _ex-tended_ between the difference (!) of past, 
<br />
present and future, grasping this difference _as such_. This was a 
<br />
way of (in Popper's terms) falsifying the classical (metaphysical) 
<br />
ideal, that all things are _in_ time in the same way. But, indeed, 
<br />
this does not mean, that living beings are in the same way _in_ time 
<br />
as, say, chairs or stars... Thus, your question concerning the 
<br />
relation of _information_ to _time_ becomes a question of how beings 
<br />
are in time and how their different _being in time_ is interrelated 
<br />
to each other. In other words, we have to do with an extremely 
<br />
complex situation...

<br />
<p>Dear Rafael and All:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafael Capurro's analysis on conversion and transformation
<br />
is eye-catching. Although the statement
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the real problem is, how one of those forms of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be converted into the other.
</em><br />
<p>is Werner's not mine, Rafael's reminder on the linguistic aspect
<br />
of information should be well taken. If one raises the question of
<br />
&quot;Which does information refer to, the experienced or experience?&quot;,
<br />
we would be at a loss for the choice. The safer choice may be for 
<br />
both. This has been what both Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker and 
<br />
G. Bateson seemed to imply. If we concentrate only on the 
<br />
experienced, what experience is all about would quite easily slip 
<br />
away. In contrast, if we limit ourselves only to experience per se, 
<br />
many of us who are not trained as philosophers would lose the jobs.
<br />
Our linguistic institution must have some secret to cope with both
<br />
the experienced and experience. In this regard, Ray Paton's 
<br />
distinction between different things at different times and 
<br />
different times for different things is quite suggestive. This
<br />
perspective seems to invite us to think about a possible 
<br />
relationship between information and time uder a bit new light. 
<br />
If we feel sick and tired with Newtonian time and its relativistic 
<br />
cousins, what should be an alternative? Cells are very smart as 
<br />
Ray said, even if they do not know who Mr Newton is. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro Matsuno
