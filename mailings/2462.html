A while ago I've enjoyed Mermin's accessible introduction to quantum 
<br />
physics for those who are already familiar with probability theory and 
<br />
computer science: <a href="../../arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207118">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207118</a>

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, one may say: well we have a rather strange description of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum waves-particles, namely, by using the tensor product of Hilbert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spaces to describe composite systems, but it may be, nevertheless, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely classical and local model behind this? Of course, Bell would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you: not at all.
</em><br />
<p>So we have the notion of the wave function \Phi. \Phi is a superposition 
<br />
of all possible classical states, and each classical state has an 
<br />
associated weight.
<br />
<p>As for our disagreement regarding the bathtub, and classical versus 
<br />
quantum waves. I agree that quantum physics would model the wave as a 
<br />
weighted superposition of all possible measurements (AB, notAnotB, 
<br />
notAB, AnotB). On the other hand, the classical wave, under the 
<br />
assumption of determinism, only carries a single outcome. But we do not 
<br />
know what that outcome is! In quantum physics we thus model the 
<br />
uncertainty in a single experiment: the wave function is a model of the 
<br />
underlying process.
<br />
<p>In a classical context we can also model the uncertainty about what 
<br />
exactly will be the outcome of the full experiment. While each 
<br />
individual experiment might be deterministic (here we do not distinguish 
<br />
between inherent randomness and observer's ignorance), across a number 
<br />
of experiments, we cannot predict the outcome of the full experiment: 
<br />
sometimes it will be AB, sometimes notAnotB, sometimes AnotB and yet 
<br />
sometimes notAB. In that respect, switching off the light in the room 
<br />
with the bathtub would correspond to the quantum wave: as we don't know 
<br />
what pattern of the splashes into detectors' eyes will happen, we have 
<br />
to allow for all four possibilities (each with its probability) prior to 
<br />
learning the actual results of the measurement.
<br />
<p>In that respect, once we learn the value of A, we obtain some 
<br />
information about the value of B. I would express entanglement by the 
<br />
inequality I(A;B) &gt; 0 (mutual information between A and B is greater 
<br />
than zero) which means that A and B have something in common. If so, 
<br />
H(B|A) &lt; H(B) (entropy of B when knowing A is less than the entropy of B).
<br />
<p>Thus, the joint probability mass P(A,B) is constant. However, P(B|A=a) 
<br />
is not the same as P(B) if A and B are not independent (ie. are entangled).
<br />
<p>My suggestion would be to reconsider the wave function and to interpret 
<br />
the &quot;weight&quot; corresponding to each Hilbert space base vector as a 
<br />
classical probability. But, I might be missing something. If I am, what 
<br />
is the difference between quantum probabilities and joint probability 
<br />
distributions? Can quantum probabilities do something that joint 
<br />
probability distributions can't? Is the process of quantum measurement 
<br />
the same as the operation of taking the conditional distribution?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is one thing that couple both detectors. This is nothing else than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. In all experiments there is such a thing as  TIME WINDOW and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimenter identify two clicks as belonging to an entangled pair 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if these clicks are inside the time window. 
</em><br />
<p>Agreed, this relates to the problem of defining what is an event in 
<br />
classical probability. In that respect, the definition of an event 
<br />
depends on the time window within which we interpret two detections as 
<br />
relating to the same event. This is how we have chosen to conceptualize 
<br />
the world.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time window we identify a special series of clicks in labs, so we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extract a special ensemble S_AB of particles. If we choose another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; orientations, say C and D, then through the time window we shall get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another ensemble S_CD. If the situation is really such and ensembles are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really statistically different, then this gives us purely classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of the violation of Bell\'s inequality. However, it is common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that S_AB has the same statistical properties as S_CD. 
</em><br />
<p>I would be interested in how to express A,B,C and D in terms of 
<br />
properties. Thus, if we have detectors A and B, and o(A) and o(B) are 
<br />
their orientations, I would be interested in the probabilistic model of 
<br />
P(A,B|o(A),o(B)) or the joint probability distribution of clicks in A 
<br />
and B given the orientations of A and B.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; called FAIR SAMPLING ASSUMPTION. I thing it is not justified, see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309010">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309010</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Experimental Scheme to Test the Fair Sampling Assumption in EPR-Bell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Experiments]
</em><br />
<p>This is intriguing. I would be curious about the results of such 
<br />
experiment. Indeed, the above model P(A,B|o(A),o(B)) would require the 
<br />
probabilities to sum up to 1 for normalization purposes, perhaps simply 
<br />
by having a high probability of the 0/0 event (no detection in either 
<br />
detector).
<br />
<p>Finally, I would recommend Cerf&amp;Adami's paper &quot;Information theory of 
<br />
quantum entanglement and measurement&quot; 
<br />
<a href="../../quic.ulb.ac.be/publications/1998-PhysicaD-120-62.pdf">http://quic.ulb.ac.be/publications/1998-PhysicaD-120-62.pdf</a> - It is 
<br />
closely related to my own work in a statistical/information theoretic 
<br />
context (<a href="../../kt.ijs.si/aleks/Int/default.htm">http://kt.ijs.si/aleks/Int/</a>)
<br />
