Friends---
<br />
<p>I wish that I were more free to participate in the discussion here,
<br />
but what has taken me away may be of interest to FISers. I have been
<br />
tasked by the US NIST (National Institute of Standards and
<br />
Technology) to advise on a possible new research program. I have only
<br />
two months, but have significant travel funds. This is an invitation
<br />
to interested FISers to help shape recommendations and perhaps create
<br />
new sponsorship.
<br />
<p>Interested parties should contact me directly. Details on what is up follow:
<br />
<p>The application domain is business enterprises as complex systems.
<br />
The general goal is to use emergent systems/agents to empower
<br />
self-organizing aggregations of small and medium sized companies
<br />
(perhaps individuals) to perform complex. collaborative work. Vast
<br />
benefits to society are expected.
<br />
<p>Our work focuses on new paradigms. The Santa Fe approach and the
<br />
conventional reaction (call it the Hofstadter/Wolfram view) are not
<br />
our focus for uninteresting reasons,  rather we are tasked to explore
<br />
investing the notion of information with the impetus for (multilevel)
<br />
structure. A revisiting of thermodynamics is assumed. This seems to
<br />
fit the interest of some FISers.
<br />
<p>Programwise, this is where we are: The European Commission is
<br />
planning its sixth framework for the &quot;Information Society
<br />
Technologies&quot; program, probably at about 4 Billion Euros. The &quot;lead&quot;
<br />
element is smart organizations, and the &quot;key&quot; element of that is
<br />
self-organizing enterprises. Much work has gone into defining the
<br />
problem, with recent workshops of experts in Singapore, Paris,
<br />
Washington, Berlin, Valencia and Brussels. Now the job is to define
<br />
the &quot;solution space&quot; especially the clever thinking like we see here.
<br />
<p>NIST is sponsoring this small exploration with a goal of building a
<br />
US program, but an agreement with the EC allows them to be a
<br />
&quot;customer&quot; as well. The US program is likely to be heavily based on
<br />
biocomputing metaphors and include our National Institutes of Health
<br />
(as well as the usual gang: NSF, and ARPA).
<br />
<p>If you are interested in contributing or reviewing, please contact me
<br />
at &lt;tedg&#64;sirius-beta.com&gt;. Ideas are sought as well as information on
<br />
cogent research centers.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
