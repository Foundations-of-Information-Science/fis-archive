<p>
Jerry's comments are very interesting. I fully agree that thought 
<br />
cannot be 'initiated outside the present progressive mode'; which is 
<br />
also to say, that nothing - an object, a genre, a species -, much 
<br />
less a thought, can be 'initiated' outside that mode -- a mode that 
<br />
interfiliates the present with the continuity of the past/future and 
<br />
is therefore, as he says, 'based on a sense of trust' about the 
<br />
course of future events. This is not knowledge OF those future 
<br />
events, merely a knowledge 'that' there will be future events and 
<br />
that these will be events that one can interact with.
<br />
<p>This is evident in the pragmaticism of Jerry's later comments, with 
<br />
their emphasis on the First Law of Logic/Energy, which pertains to 
<br />
continuity - as well as the 2nd, which pertains to otherness, and 
<br />
the 3rd, which pertains to relations.  (Jerry - you seem to be a 
<br />
Peircean?)
<br />
<p>Therefore,
<br />
1. I myself cannot privilege matter, time or space. They are 
<br />
interfiliated.
<br />
2. A 'leap in time' suggests time as an absolute scale separate from 
<br />
the energy/information, and since my view interfiliates them all, 
<br />
then, there cannot be any 'leap' from 'now' to' future'.
<br />
3. It would be both a scientific and metaphysical question to speak 
<br />
of the 'start of evolution'. After all, science deals with knowledge 
<br />
of the existential. Therefore, even though both science and 
<br />
metaphysics cannot really answer that question, both must consider 
<br />
it.
<br />
4. What are scientific values other than a commitment to 
<br />
axioms, whose properties are derived from sensation and organized 
<br />
within reason - and how can these properties not also be human 
<br />
values? To come up with axioms that are NOT scientific (ie, that 
<br />
are only based on, as Peirce commented ) merely private opinions, 
<br />
authoritarian dogma or common belief - is to develop axioms that are 
<br />
without pragmatic or ethical value.
<br />
<p>5. Well, I feel that scientific values are similar to those in other 
<br />
areas - . Based as they are, on the organization of sensual data 
<br />
according to logical 'laws' -. The fact that mathematics may exclude 
<br />
its rules from sensual data does not mean that the logic of those 
<br />
laws is isolate from the actualities of the sensual world.
<br />
<p>6. I think I would like more of an explanation from Jerry on point 6, 
<br />
before I give a full answer, for I don't feel that any of the three 
<br />
laws are operative alone. They only operate, as laws, because they 
<br />
are each, there and interfiliated with each other. 
<br />
<p>Best regards,
