<p>
The civilizing processes conceived, structured and implemented 
<br />
through discovery and invention of information have culminated in the 
<br />
manifestation of an HOMOSPHERE that has been continuously growing 
<br />
without being noticed that the carrying capacity of the terrestrial 
<br />
Nature is finite, and assuming de facto that the existence of human 
<br />
life could be considered GRANTED FOR EVER.
<br />
<p>However the civilization is a fact whether we liked or not; whether 
<br />
some humans justify its existence by means of reasoning while others 
<br />
question its manifestation also by means of reasoning, which becomes 
<br />
in both cases the subject that motivates communication.
<br />
<p>Therefore it couldn't be denied that OUR magnificent and 
<br />
controversial WESTERN civilization, the only one that prevails at 
<br />
present - seriously criticized and also seriously defended by means 
<br />
of terrorism ideologically conceived and technologically organized - 
<br />
is the environment where every one of the vast majority of humans 
<br />
(99.99%) essays day after day to vindicate his or her presence in 
<br />
time and in space.
<br />
<p>Due to perhaps obvious reasons most humans search almost tireless, 
<br />
despite many failures, the proper information - biased by left or 
<br />
right or central or green or dogmatic ideologies or even one 
<br />
encouraged by fundamentalism  - that may allow each human to organize 
<br />
consciously his or her immediate survival, being ready though not 
<br />
sufficiently aware about the kind of available information that would 
<br />
allow everyone individually to react spontaneously and even very 
<br />
often successfully when being confronted to unexpected difficult, 
<br />
risky and very dangerous situations.
<br />
<p>So far so good say many humans who assume that all what matters is to 
<br />
try to be happy enough while living miserably or surrounded by all 
<br />
civilized facilities or stealing things and ideas or killing people 
<br />
and animals for pleasure or in the name of a certain divine 
<br />
personality or taking unilateral advantage of everything found in the 
<br />
surroundings, etc.
<br />
<p>What kind of information uses every human for being happy?
<br />
<p>Are humans entitled to generated or invent information for learning 
<br />
through experimentation what might be or should be the role of humans 
<br />
on Earth or what kind of contribution could be expected from Homo 
<br />
sapiens sapiens - comprised the loquens one - for leading somewhere, 
<br />
therefore purposefully, the evolutionary possibilities on this unique 
<br />
planet.
<br />
<p>Today the INFORMATION accumulated through diverse kinds of 
<br />
communication among humans shows that the whole civilizing adventure 
<br />
has become:
<br />
<p>*	a controversial concern, as it is interpreted diversely even 
<br />
by every brain during the time everyone is alive;
<br />
<p>*	a contradictory affair as most humans reject, rather 
<br />
childishly, the savage wildness of the whole Nature while building 
<br />
more and more aberrant urban environments where human life can be 
<br />
efficiently organized without being noticed that NATURE was. Is and 
<br />
will be the main circumstance that makes possible the presence of 
<br />
humans on Earth, our unique planet as there is not any other space in 
<br />
the whole Universe for these frankly arrogant beings;
<br />
<p>*	a dangerous informational framework as it intends to justify 
<br />
the need of a globalized warfare as it has been cleverly organized by 
<br />
highly civilized fellows during the last twentieth century until 
<br />
today. It is very valuable information that would be nor advisable 
<br />
neither sensible to ignore: the First World War (1914 -1918) and the 
<br />
Second World War (1939 -1945) as childish and mature searching of a 
<br />
new world order that would allow the highly civilized countries to 
<br />
distribute among them the other countries that were considered as 
<br />
primitive, barbarous or poorly civilized communities. The Third World 
<br />
War, an economic warfare organized and implemented during the postwar 
<br />
period (1950s - 1990s) by winners and losers of the second one. It 
<br />
was not even declared but it was quite successful because it allowed 
<br />
empowered countries (supported by capitalistic or socialist 
<br />
ideologies) by means of Research and Development policies to continue 
<br />
taking advantage unilaterally of natural resources located anywhere 
<br />
on the planet causing all the other countries (identified by 
<br />
definition as less developed ones) to become poorer and poorer. The 
<br />
Fourth World War, an economic, political and cultural warfare 
<br />
conceived for modernizing the previous colonization through the 
<br />
development of information and communication technology, and 
<br />
announced through powerful mass media as the unique possibility of 
<br />
organizing faster and faster everything related with the needs of 
<br />
human way of life (transportation, communications, data processing, 
<br />
internet 1995,...) in modern times. It has aimed at destroying 
<br />
borders, governments and nationalisms because they are not longer 
<br />
necessary, but it has become already the source of globalization of 
<br />
unemployment, criminality, misery, corruption, hypocrisy,... The 
<br />
possible Fifth World War, a warfare that seems to be inspired and 
<br />
encouraged by some divinities. It is the first one that has been 
<br />
already conceived in the 21st century, which apparently emerged 
<br />
unexpectedly, though perhaps it confirms humankind the announced 
<br />
apocalypse during several millennia after being recognized that a 
<br />
certain god - necessarily a divine one - has chosen to protect and 
<br />
support a certain number of people for fighting (till winning) 
<br />
against another group of people also protected and supported by 
<br />
another divine god.
