<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;As we have seen from the discussion so far, there is not a lot of agreement

on the meaning of 'information'. However, we have been able to communicate
<br />
fairly well, despite diverse views on the matter. This suggests that the
<br />
definition of 'information' is far less important than the enthusiasm about
<br />
the correct definition of the term might lead one to believe.&lt;
<br />
<p>Stockinger:
<br />
The meaning of information may be a good point of reentry. However, the
<br />
meaning of the meaning is different from the meaning. Thats why i think that
<br />
the enthusiasm is not only about a correct definition o information
<br />
(meaning), but about what it means to work with the notion of information
<br />
and get insights in the area where one applies it. We search for
<br />
&quot;information&quot; because we already experienced that by doing so we can get a
<br />
closer look to processes and relations in nature and society. The
<br />
unification of the concept, therefore, does not necessarily rely on a common
<br />
definition, but on a second order level, where the information concept
<br />
stands for a processual, relational and operational approach to the fenomena
<br />
of life and other forms of selforganized existence.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&quot;information processing&quot; and &quot;communication theory&quot;. Both deal solely with
</em><br />
syntactic or formal aspects of information, but have had a powerful impact
<br />
on our conceptions of information in general. These applications of the
<br />
idea of information are essentially technological, notwithstanding their
<br />
highly formal nature, and were developed primarily by engineers, or those
<br />
working in an engineering environment.&lt;
<br />
<p>To connect: thats still the case. What has changed is the IT itself, where
<br />
interactiviy and multimediality caracterize the actual state. So, even when
<br />
appliying shannos infotheory to actual comm.systems, its complexity has to
<br />
be elevated to get hold of the context.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;1) How much can technical applications tell us about information &quot;in the
</em><br />
wild&quot;?, &lt;
<br />
In the wild, does that mean in &quot;nature&quot;? Because in society, the &quot;wild&quot; is
<br />
civilized by channeled information, isnt it? Or do you mean &quot;daily life&quot;,
<br />
everyday events?
<br />
However, de novo, there is the double meaning of information. The one need
<br />
to communicate, and the one &quot;within&quot; the objects communicated. How do they
<br />
relate, thats the question. Does the object express itself in its
<br />
&quot;wildness&quot;, or is it formed purely by interpretation of the observer. What
<br />
we learn by IT applications is, that whatever is communicated, it belongs to
<br />
the receiver, no matter if he/she/it is an internal or external
<br />
construction. Another point that IT tells us, is that there is a channel
<br />
which may operate on its own rules and get relative autonomy in the
<br />
information process. In biology the channel may represent a messaging
<br />
environment. In society, all kinds of mediated communication ar channeled
<br />
for some kind of benefit.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How far can we go with formal and mechanical models of the properties of
<br />
information?
<br />
When you mean by mechanical that &quot;actio est reactio&quot;, there is no
<br />
information availiable, and not even necessary. Nothings changes which would
<br />
be worth it to be communicated.
<br />
Formalisms, on the ohter hand, may do their job, while abstracting from
<br />
observed principles in nature and society, like structuring, order
<br />
maintainance, equilibrium (and its opposites).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; &quot;The 'hardware + software' dualism leads to a misleading conception
</em><br />
of cell. In cells 'biomolecule + function' are inseparable elements in
<br />
contrast with computers. in cells it is impossible to have biomolecules
<br />
without biological function.
<br />
<p>Also: &quot;the body + mind dualism leads to a wrong conception of person. In
<br />
persons &quot;thought + action&quot;. In persons, there is no communication-act
<br />
without functions.
