<p>
One colleague from ISSS passed on this message from moveon.org for 
<br />
others to consider. I am writing a note of my own, which I shall 
<br />
later show you. I hope and wish everybody  may encourage himself or 
<br />
herself in responding to this to write his or her own words from his 
<br />
or her heart. Now is certainly the time to do it as soon as possible 
<br />
which means not unfortunately late
<br />
<p>.
<br />
<p>Automated message from Moveon.org:
<br />
<p>Please join me in signing an online petition asking President Bush
<br />
to let the weapons inspections work, rather than rushing to war.
<br />
If we don't act now, we could be at war by the end of the month.
<br />
<p>Inspections in Iraq have started.  Most of us breathed a sigh of
<br />
relief.  Unfortunately, it's become clear that the ultra-hawks in
<br />
the Bush administration -- Cheney, Wolfowitz, Perle -- will not
<br />
take yes for an answer.  While the rest of the world thinks Iraq
<br />
has backed down, these men are pursuing a massive public relations
<br />
blitz for war.
<br />
<p>With the possibility of a peaceful resolution to this crisis at hand,
<br />
we cannot allow a few men to push the world to war.  Send a message
<br />
to President Bush and Congress to let the inspections work at:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/default.htm">http://www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/</a>
<br />
<p>MoveOn.org will compile our messages and present them to the
<br />
administration, including Secretary of State Powell, to U.N.
<br />
Secretary General Kofi Annan, and to members of Congress.
<br />
<p>The good news is that the ultra-hawks face some serious opposition.
<br />
Secretary of State Colin Powell and other members of the Bush
<br />
Administration are willing to give diplomacy a chance, and the State
<br />
Department's interpretation of the U.N. resolution is a lot more
<br />
reasonable than the White House's interpretation.
<br />
<p>President Bush has agreed that war should be the very last resort.
<br />
Let's hold him and his Administration to those words:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/default.htm">http://www.moveon.org/winwithoutwar/</a>
<br />
<p>Please join me and sign on today.  We must support policy makers who
<br />
will oppose these few extremists in the Bush White House who have been
<br />
looking for an excuse for war from the very beginning.
