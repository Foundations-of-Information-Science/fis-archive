<p>
Yes, indeed there is consensus. Let me go thru Arne's points about the
<br />
functioning of the brain so that we can deepen the consensus.
<br />
<p>Arne:
<br />
<p>I will also take the opportunity to say that my point with formulating the
<br />
realist's dilemma was to point out that a human being in principle is unable
<br />
to produce a model of human perception on the basis of
<br />
observation/experimentation. The human capacity of perception is the cause
<br />
of this shortcoming, which is then also a shortcoming of the experimental
<br />
methodology - a fact that is seldom recognised. The brain-internal feed-back
<br />
pathways of data (not information!) here play a decisive role. The human
<br />
brain has not evolved to an instrument of truth replication at all - on the
<br />
contrary the brain is magnificent tool of adaptation. 
<br />
<p>Karl:
<br />
<p>The human brain has evolved to maximise reproductional chances (Darwin).
<br />
Insofar truth replication is a part of increasing chances of reproduction,
<br />
that brain is preferred above others, which do not, in the quest for
<br />
reproduction, that recognises truth. Truth being a re-membered, re-cognised
<br />
state of the brain, the process definitely has something to do with re-doing
<br />
something (in the same fashion, over the same subject, with the same
<br />
methods). Therefore we can recognise that our brain is biased towards
<br />
recognising entities which are similar to each other.  (That animal which
<br />
recognises where it can feed and what to avoid has better chances of
<br />
survival and reproduction than another which does not recognise
<br />
similarities.)
<br />
<p>Arne:
<br />
<p>Well - back to our dawning consensus. When we are unable to make certain
<br />
decisions by observation/experiments we are BOUND to decide by consensual
<br />
decisions - and thus directed to a science based on social construction and
<br />
consensus. 
<br />
<p>Karl:
<br />
<p>The social consensus we observe is that similarity is the clever way to use
<br />
the brain. 
<br />
<p>Arne:
<br />
<p>To my mind (and Bohr's) there is only one - the domain of experience;
<br />
personally constructed experience and shared/consensually constructed
<br />
&quot;experience&quot; (or scientifically constructed models).
<br />
<p>Karl:
<br />
<p>In FIS we have constructed a common experience of trying to feel into a
<br />
consensus that another clever way to use the brain is to concentrate on
<br />
dissimilarities existing alongside similarities while organising into
<br />
systems of  thought-up, abstracted, experienced, etc. ways of using the
<br />
brain.
<br />
<p>Arne:
<br />
<p>To my surprise it seems we finally landed on a platform of consensus --- and
<br />
I fully agree with Pedro when saying  the future will tell whether we are
<br />
able to trascend formal analogies 
<br />
<p>Karl: 
<br />
<p>Why is there a need to transcend formal analogies? They are quite useful.
<br />
Let us use the formal analogies that are there, time-honoured and
<br />
consensual, but let us use them in a different fashion (alongside the usual
<br />
fashions). 
<br />
<p>Arne:
<br />
. achieve a new, more catholic approach to information / and science as a
<br />
whole/
<br />
<p>Karl:
<br />
<p>Why so timid? We are the catholic fount of veritas in things concerning the
<br />
theory of information. Indeed, this group has evolved a concept of
<br />
information that hasx quite many aspects to it. And to be more traditional
<br />
as by explaining it all by the logical rounding error one commits when
<br />
conducting an addition - I mean, what is less offensive than that? Catholic
<br />
in the sense that it is all-pervading it is because it is rooted in numbers
<br />
and counting; catholic in that sense that it is within a system of concepts
<br />
and fits neatly - well, counting IS the core dogma of mathematics.
