reply to Gottfried Stockinger's reply
<br />
<p>(from Bob Artiagiani)
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>It is a pleasure to make your electronic acquaintance.  I appreciate your
<br />
taking time to respond and think we are very close, although the points on
<br />
which we disagree are important and the disagreements there are large.
<br />
Rather than walk down your text responding to you point by point, perhaps I
<br />
can try*and it will be hard*to produce a summary response.
<br />
<p>The difference between us on whether information is generated internally by
<br />
fluctuations in social systems, which fluctuations are creative individual
<br />
acts, is only one of emphasis.  I of course agree that people create
<br />
alternative behaviors and that societies are conservative organizations
<br />
acting purposefully to replicate proven patterns of behavior.  I think we
<br />
are both recognizing that when a fluctuation within a society alters its
<br />
internal relations it also alters the society*s relations with the external
<br />
world.  Both alterations will affect social roles played by individuals,
<br />
which will threaten and confuse some and lead many to resist.  This is
<br />
indeed entropy.
<br />
<p>So I am not denying there are internal sources of evolutionary change but
<br />
merely stating what I think is now a platitude--that there is an entropy
<br />
price to pay for it.  That platitude can turn out to be profoundly
<br />
important, however, if you accept the argument that at least some of what
<br />
we consider our human identity emerges in the context social evolution
<br />
creates.  If you will accept that, then we can bring back the Idea of
<br />
Progress, give meaning to history, and support an Enlightenment
<br />
ideal*without being blind to costs (entropy) or naive about expectations
<br />
(no guarantees variations will produce more humane realities).  But one
<br />
intellectual obligation inherent in the argument is that we not assume a
<br />
fully developed human self, consciousness, mind, etc is just plain given.
<br />
This human being is, as Vico said in 1724, what we need to explain.  I,
<br />
like him, try to do it by relating the human to the social context*the
<br />
world human actions make.
<br />
<p>Now I do think that social systems must be embedded in a context.  Even if
<br />
the system, to be a system, is partly decoupled from its environment, it
<br />
cannot long survive isolated from it.  So when a fluctuation generates
<br />
information that is a way of saying that a transformed society is
<br />
environmentally selected.  (We have here the clue to why the fit survive
<br />
and the survivors are fit, by the way.)  So information is about something,
<br />
in this case the context in which a society is embedded.
<br />
<p>But I do not imagine that information is sitting *out there* in some
<br />
Platonic world waiting to be discovered.  If the world is truly dynamic and
<br />
evolving, then information is created.  I tried to express this idea by
<br />
saying that social systems interact with or observe their worlds*by, for
<br />
instance, the altered effects they have on the world because of either
<br />
self-organization or fluctuations in their structures.  Since observation
<br />
has effects*makes a difference*I would suppose that difference is the
<br />
information created.  It is still a measure of reduced uncertainty,
<br />
however.  But the world about which the social observer is uncertain is
<br />
new*it is the different world that evolved when interactions between what
<br />
previously existed and the fluctuated social system occurred.  I know this
<br />
prose is tortured, but I think something like this must be involved and the
<br />
trick is to express it more straightforwardly.  Any help will be much
<br />
appreciated.
<br />
<p>But this is partly why I argued social roles store or record information
<br />
rather than saying they are made of it.  And it is important to me that if
<br />
the information is social what is stored in a role is not just what an
<br />
individual knows but what the society in which the individual acts knows.
<br />
That is why philosophers and soldiers do not invent themselves.  But it is
<br />
equally important to recognize that the particular characteristics of the
<br />
first individuals to play roles will have enduring effects, for they become
<br />
models for succeeding generations of erstwhile philosophers, soldiers, etc.
<br />
Again, the circular causality involved above has effects here, for the
<br />
person and the role *emerge* simultaneously.  Newton, for example, is as
<br />
much the social creation of his age as of his own intellect, for what the
<br />
world credited him with accomplishing is not what he intended.
<br />
<p>I am getting tired and my thread is slipping.  But Gottfried and I seem to
<br />
be led to different conclusions about what the *stuff* of societies is.
<br />
That is most unfortunate, because it is very hard for people to even see
<br />
the need for thinking about such a question, and I would very much like to
<br />
have a friend on this point.  Anyway, I think this is a matter of
<br />
perspective, which means getting your mind bent around an issue in some
<br />
peculiar way.  I bent mine by saying to myself if societies are real they
<br />
must be made of something; if they are made from human beings the something
<br />
of which societies are made must be their interactions; if interactions
<br />
make a difference and create information then relations between humans
<br />
affect what they do; if behavior matters in this circumstance it must be
<br />
because what individual humans do is correlated*people act as if they know
<br />
what one another are doing.  These actions must be a reduced set of the
<br />
total number of possible actions, which mean!
<br />
s they measure reduced uncertainty.  But, again, it is reduced uncertainty
<br />
about a world changed by interactions*if my behavior is different because
<br />
of what other people do, their behavior is different because of what I do
<br />
and all of our behavior is different because*in the highly unlikely case*we
<br />
are all doing something that makes each of us more likely to do something
<br />
similar again.  Why would we do that?  Because by our collective actions we
<br />
created*not discovered*a new world, a world in which selection acts on the
<br />
whole rather than directly on the parts.  Thus, I think it is these
<br />
interactions and their combined effects which release environmental matter
<br />
and energy flows processed by correlated behaviors that constitute
<br />
societies.
<br />
<p>It is not easy to see behavior as stuff, for our Western minds have been
<br />
habituated to more materialistic perceptions.  But if there is a new
<br />
scientific paradigm here we need to bend our minds to see things
<br />
differently.  So rather than making information stuff and calling it
<br />
energy, I have chosen to say that societies being different kinds of
<br />
realities have a new kind of *material**not the biological human beings
<br />
from which they come but regularized human actions, which are the
<br />
propensities encouraged by the way relationships load the dice in favor of
<br />
one rather than another act.  Individuals, however, need tools for
<br />
anticipating how to choose between behavioral options.  One tool is the
<br />
slave-driver*s lash.  But another with more long-term benefits for everyone
<br />
is Values, Ethics, and Morals (VEMs).  For me, they map the roles and
<br />
relations constituting societies, as, I think, DNA maps the roles and
<br />
relations constituting organisms.  As I tried to say, I also think there is
<br />
a !
<br />
correlation between VEM symbols, behaviors, and social rewards/punishments.
<br />
If so, we can turn to other sources for the material and motive forces
<br />
activating societies*I am really tired now and may have to eat this later:
<br />
Sorry if it is stupid.  I am offering an analogy*if organism could not be
<br />
made without DNA, DNA is not what organisms are made of.  Fluctuations in
<br />
behavior which destabilize societies, therefore, will either be repressed
<br />
or ignored, unless their environmental effects lead to a restabilization.
<br />
If the latter occurs, the VEMs orchestrating societies need to be revised.
<br />
<p>The cultural wars fought over revising VEMs Gottfried mentions are another
<br />
mark of the entropy associated with social change.  But if environmental
<br />
selection favors societies whose VEMs permit them to flourish in altered,
<br />
often expanded worlds, then progress has been made.  I think the VEMs we
<br />
have now*compared to those of 2-3000 years ago*represent changes tracking
<br />
social evolution which can be considered *progress.*  And I think we can
<br />
define progress as VEMs mapping roles and relations stimulating individuals
<br />
to reflect upon themselves, empowering them to choose, and equipping them
<br />
with responsibilities.
<br />
<p>I apologize for being so long-winded.
<br />
