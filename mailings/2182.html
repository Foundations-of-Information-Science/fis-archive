                <p>
                    Folks,
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the definitional matter, energy and information are intimately
                    <br />
                    related to each other. My only concern here will be to call some attention
                    <br />
                    to the issue of information in relation to energy, I would hope.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy conceived in the first law of thermodynamics on energy
                    <br />
                    transformation is informational in precipitating a new type of energy
                    <br />
                    carrier through cohesive interactions acting among the pre-existing energy
                    <br />
                    carriers. Energy transformation is informational in making a new difference.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A principal energy carrier met with in material processes is a Planck's
                    <br />
                    energy quantum. Nonetheless, a Planck's energy quantum does not transform
                    <br />
                    itself within linear quantum mechanics, though it can yield a macroscopic
                    <br />
                    coherence by way of a linear superposition of each microscopic quantum. If
                    <br />
                    the relative time interval for the occurrence of nonlinear quantum coherence
                    <br />
                    is limited, the likely quantum coherence to occur would be at most of a
                    <br />
                    linear type allowing only a linear superposition. In contrast, appearance or
                    <br />
                    emergence of a new quantum of interest may be expected from nonlinear
                    <br />
                    quantum coherence of a lasting type.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concrete example demonstrating a nonlinear quantum coherence of a
                    <br />
                    lasting type is a reaction cycle functioning as a quantum as a heat engine.
                    <br />
                    The citric acid cycle running in the presence of temperature gradients alone
                    <br />
                    without recourse to enzymes of biological origin is internally coherent only
                    <br />
                    nonlinearly, which Atsushi Nemoto and myself observed in my lab. The
                    <br />
                    nonlinearity of the reaction cycle is in the robustness of the cycle itself,
                    <br />
                    such that the cycle has the capacity of resilience even in the presence of
                    <br />
                    adverse or hostile disturbances from the outside, without responding to the
                    <br />
                    latter merely linearly.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum as a heat engine is undoubtedly an energy carrier, but more than
                    <br />
                    that. It is also informational in that there are almost innumerable rich
                    <br />
                    varieties of distinguishable quanta as heat engines that are alternatively
                    <br />
                    called organisms.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One attempt for addressing nonlinear quantum coherence underlying a
                    <br />
                    quantum as a heat engine is in reference to its classicality. Classical
                    <br />
                    objects do not exhibit quantum entanglement holding linear quantum
                    <br />
                    coherence. Despite that, any classical object, whether inorganic or organic,
                    <br />
                    is quantum mechanical in its molecular makeup, and can sometimes exhibit an
                    <br />
                    enormous coherence internally. Here enters nonlinear quantum coherence. It
                    <br />
                    prohibits the entanglement of linear quantum coherence like classical
                    <br />
                    objects. In addition, it also demonstrates the robustness of the
                    <br />
                    organization as facing the possible adverse influences coming from the
                    <br />
                    surroundings, while exhibiting a contrast to classical objects conceived in
                    <br />
                    classical sciences in which the robustness of the objects is always sought
                    <br />
                    in the form of boundary conditions of external origin.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One merit of referring to information in the realm of material sciences
                    <br />
                    is that it has the capacity of crossing over the boundary between classical
                    <br />
                    and quantum sciences rather freely in both ways.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit lengthy posting, indeed.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
