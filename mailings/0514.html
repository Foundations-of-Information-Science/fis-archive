<p>
With regard to the last few posts (Fenzl, Brier, Menant), I agree very
<br />
much with all of Norbert's comments on the nature of signs and
<br />
information - and that physico-chemical systems are most certainly
<br />
involved in information processing. As he points out, the difference
<br />
between abiotic and biotic information processing is the difference in
<br />
'quality' of the whole process. I feel that all systems process
<br />
'information' in a triadic manner (input of sensate data;  mediation
<br />
via normative rules; and resultant interpretation). That is, our
<br />
universe is a complex system at all levels. However, the relations in
<br />
this triadic process are different at each level, moving from the most
<br />
simple relation (iconic) to indexical to symbolic. Only humans process
<br />
information within symbolic relations.
<br />
<p>However, I think that terms have to be clarified, for I feel that we
<br />
are confusing 'sign', 'information'.
<br />
The interpretive process is triadic. A variation of energy, between X
<br />
system and Y system, as pointed out by Menant, is experienced by the
<br />
two systems as a signal. In Peircean terms it would be an 'immediate
<br />
object' in a categorical mode of Firstness. This is NOT YET
<br />
information. It is 'data', signal, sensation'..or whatever term you
<br />
use to mean an acceptance of energy/matter within your system's
<br />
boundaries...but not yet an interpretation (absorption, functional
<br />
usage) of that energy/matter.
<br />
This input of energy/matter is then transformed by the normative rules
<br />
of your system. These normative rules can be both innate (laws of
<br />
chemical molecular formation; genetic patterns) or learned (behaviour)
<br />
but they act as normative constraints that consider all input
<br />
energy/matter. This mode is defined by Peirce as Thirdness. Another
<br />
term is 'knowledge'. Or Representamen in Peirce's terms.
<br />
THEN - the final result is an 'interpretant' (and there can be several
<br />
steps to this)...which is 'information'.  It is in a state of
<br />
Secondness.
<br />
<p>Now- what, in Peircean terms, is a Sign? It's the whole triadic
<br />
process. .
<br />
<p>So- the triadic process is always in operation. Can any of these modes
<br />
exist per se, all alone 'out there&quot;. Here I disagree with Soren who
<br />
feels that Secondness can exist by itself. I also disagree with his
<br />
conclusion that Thirdness can exist without 'having a genuine sign'.
<br />
A formation of energy, completely by itself, in a state of Secondness
<br />
(2-2-2 would be the triadic code)...well, an example is a weathervane,
<br />
a mechanical unit. But it doesn't really exist 'by itself', for even
<br />
its mere existential existence is dependent on its differential
<br />
relations with other energy (the tree from which it is formed, the
<br />
fence to which it is attached, the wind that blows it). As for
<br />
Thirdness, can the normative rules exist without  involvement in a
<br />
sign - No. That would be Platonic, those pure Platonic Forms. Peirce
<br />
was not a Platonist, but an Aristotelian - and Aristotle writes
<br />
extensively against the separation of Form from its actualization
<br />
within matter.
<br />
<p>A 'proto-sign', a 'quasi-sign', would be energy that has moved into
<br />
the anticipatory zone, the interface area, of a system A, but has not
<br />
yet been processed via Thirdness. It can be readily dissipated.
<br />
<p>As for the conclusions of the Fuschl meeting, they fit , as noted,
<br />
right into the basic Peircean framework.
