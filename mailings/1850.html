Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded from $1.19 to 
<br />
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!
<br />
<p>Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued stock 
<br />
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year 
<br />
based on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), 
<br />
incredibly solid numbers, and low outstanding share total.
<br />
<p>Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
<br />
(OTCBB: LETH)
<br />
Current Price: 1.85
<br />
Near-Term Target: 7.00
<br />
Projected High for '04: 15.00
<br />
<p>We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE MOST 
<br />
UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for substantial 
<br />
profits immediately! 
<br />
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year 
<br />
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the bottom 
<br />
line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
<br />
indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to 
<br />
come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste 
<br />
materials into electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand that 
<br />
it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.
<br />
<p>Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:
<br />
<p>LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
<br />
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety 
<br />
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on 
<br />
the global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe 
<br />
process converts into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity such waste materials as 
<br />
Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical 
<br />
wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and 
<br />
the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of 
<br />
electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 
<br />
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to 
<br />
replenish the local or national grid.
<br />
<p>(Mar 3 '04) LETH Releases Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News
<br />
<p>LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net 
<br />
profit of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is 
<br />
scheduled to receive an additional $7 Million translating into an 
<br />
additional .24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract 
<br />
over the next 6 months. The net profit per share from just this single 
<br />
contract would value the stock above $6 by calculating the .36 cents 
<br />
per share total at an average industry PE of 18 - 22. 
<br />
<p>Examining LETH - By The Numbers:
<br />
<p>Total Assets: 36.8 Million = 1.26 per share of assets
<br />
Cash: 23.4 Million = .80 cents per share of cash
<br />
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 
<br />
million shares retired in Feb. '04
<br />
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
<br />
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
<br />
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
<br />
<p>Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:
<br />
<p>During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems have 
<br />
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 
<br />
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements 
<br />
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the 
<br />
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from 
<br />
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this 
<br />
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 
<br />
Million per Biosphere Process System! 
<br />
<p>LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:
<br />
<p>LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
<br />
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, 
<br />
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US 
<br />
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the 
<br />
securing of necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide 
<br />
monitoring of the Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now 
<br />
in the process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
<br />
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a 
<br />
monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates for major project 
<br />
revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the 
<br />
form of a huge near-term announcement.
<br />
<p>Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:
<br />
<p>LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to 
<br />
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's 
<br />
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically released 
<br />
&quot;batches&quot; of very significant news announcements regarding successfully 
<br />
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that 
<br />
pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released 
<br />
with some very big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at 
<br />
any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to 
<br />
match LETH, while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major 
<br />
profits as global demand to solve two crises areas, waste and electrical 
<br />
energy, reaches unprecedented levels.
