<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;of order or disorder, apart from &quot;entropy is disorder&quot; ?
</em><br />
<p>I am impressed that the editor of Entropy would offer such an open 
<br />
question. Your supposed to assume this is resolved (Boltzmann), yet 
<br />
complex, or unanswerable in simple terms. I have never believed in a 
<br />
complex universe. Complexity is something we don't understand properly. 
<br />
Prior to general relativity, our understanding of the large-scale 
<br />
structure of the universe (what is now space-time), was I think in a 
<br />
state of vague comprehension similar to our present comprehension of 
<br />
order and disorder.
<br />
<p>A general theory of order and disorder must bring together all the 
<br />
elements of order we experience, explaining both the physical patterns 
<br />
we observe so vividly and also the hidden order related to probability 
<br />
and potential. What is the order of the early universe? What is the 
<br />
order of a star? A spiral galaxy? A general theory must reveal how the 
<br />
simple density order of a star is different from the order of a spiral 
<br />
galaxy, or the order of a snowflake. All are physical patterns. But what 
<br />
then is the order of available energy or work? What is the order of 
<br />
rhythm and music? What is the order of fresh deck of cards or 
<br />
alphabetization? What is the order of a grocery store? What is the order 
<br />
of an entropy correlated with symmetry?
<br />
<p>A general theory must explain the inconsistencies in the existing model 
<br />
of understanding, and Dr. Lin is exposing a very signficant 
<br />
inconsistency. Isn't symmetry an expression of order? The second law 
<br />
indicates that order is generally decreasing, while disorder is 
<br />
increasing. The dense past is obviously ordered, yet density, the 
<br />
roundness of a star for example, is a very general type of order 
<br />
compared to the intricacy of a snowflake. We can easily recognize the 
<br />
order of symmetry or anti-symmetry in a checkerboard, yet what of Dr. 
<br />
Lin's correlation between entropy and symmetry. Lin has exposed 
<br />
something that can't be denied. In extreme, symmetry is ugly, boring, 
<br />
lifeless. But does this mean symmetry is not order? Is there also a 
<br />
correlation between entropy and disorder? There is clearly finely 
<br />
ordered patterns at colder temperatures, such as a snowflake. Near 
<br />
absolute zero, cesium atoms line up in columns and rows. A little 
<br />
further we run into Einstein-Bose condensate, the union of atoms into a 
<br />
single medium. The atoms are not really destroyed. They are somehow 
<br />
still inside that medium. When warmed they differentiate. Uniformity, 
<br />
symmetry, is order, but how does it relate to the order of the young 
<br />
dense universe? Why is there any order at extreme low temperatures, if 
<br />
generally disorder is increasing? Could the second law be inaccurate 
<br />
about disorder increasing?
<br />
<p>There is a new element at hand, where the tensions concerning the 
<br />
meanings of order and disorder peak, which is actually a good thing. 
<br />
Cosmologically, the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which 
<br />
disturbingly indicates the course of time is on a crash course with 
<br />
absolute zero in either finite or infinite time. How do we define 
<br />
absolute zero in respect to order and disorder? It appears now that 
<br />
absolute zero is not just a hypothetical or impossible temperature of 
<br />
matter, it is a potentially real cosmic state in our future, a state of 
<br />
zero mass, energy, density, temperature, and time. Empty space isn't 
<br />
suppose to exist, yet if expansion is accelerating, the arrow of time, 
<br />
our future, is inevitably in direct alignment with zero. But what is a 
<br />
universe stretched flat? Nothingness? Is it disorder? Isn't empty space 
<br />
perfect symmetry, the extreme of ugly symmetry!
<br />
<p>How does all this fit together?
<br />
<p>Lauri Gröhn wrote:
<br />
&quot;Why should there be just ONE definition of order? Why not have a 
<br />
metadefinition of order for defining various 'orders'?&quot;
<br />
<p>That indeed is the trick. There is not one general type of order. Nor is 
<br />
there a general disorder. There are two specific types of order, and 
<br />
only two. The density of the past and the symmetry of the future are two 
<br />
different types of order, although the order of the past is not simply 
<br />
characterized by density. The future, is perfectly characterized by 
<br />
symmetry, uniformity, balance, neutrality. The past is a little more 
<br />
complex, but not much.
<br />
<p>The universe of time, the cosmic evolution of the universe is literally 
<br />
a process of transformation from the extreme of one type of order to the 
<br />
extreme of a whole other type of order. There are two types of order in 
<br />
nature, not simply order and disorder. Generalizing order has been our 
<br />
mistake. We exist in an intermediary phase within the transition between 
<br />
the two orders, so everything we see is a product of the two orders 
<br />
combined together. We can only see the two orders in pure form at the 
<br />
beginning of time and at the end of time, although we cannot think 
<br />
simply in terms of the point of the big bang being the extreme of the 
<br />
first type of order, because there is more to the order of the past 
<br />
behind the scenes of the big bang. Hence we don't see the order of the 
<br />
past clearly. And we don't recognize that time ends at zero yet, so we 
<br />
don't see that order clearly either.
<br />
<p>The two types of order are extremely simple. We actually know them both 
<br />
very well. We do after all exist in a world structured exclusively by 
<br />
them. The first type of order is best referred to as grouping order. 
<br />
Grouping order is the order we are accustomed to recognizing. At the 
<br />
grocery store, all the products are organized into groups. Books in the 
<br />
library are organized into groups. Your home is likely organized 
<br />
utilizing grouping order. The socks are together in the drawer. The 
<br />
dishes are in the cupboard. There is also the grouping of matter into 
<br />
stars, and planets, where there is further grouping of particles into 
<br />
elements. Stars are further grouped into galaxies. Galaxies are grouped 
<br />
into clusters and superclusters. But a spiral galaxy we see nature 
<br />
utilizing both grouping and symmetry.
<br />
<p>The prototype example of grouping order is the process of setting up the 
<br />
game of checkers or chess. That process involves taking all the game 
<br />
pieces of one color (black) and placing them on one side of the board, 
<br />
then all the pieces of another color (white) are placed on the opposite 
<br />
side of the board. Grouping order is characterized by dividing things 
<br />
apart. Oppositely, symmetry order, is characterized by combining things 
<br />
together. In one direction things become individual and pronounced. In 
<br />
the other direction things become balanced and uniform.
<br />
<p>The checkerboard upon which chess or checkers is played is an ideal 
<br />
example or prototype of symmetry order. The squares are not divided 
<br />
apart into separate groups, they are mixed together evenly. Notice the 
<br />
opposition. You can either separate things into groups, or mix them 
<br />
together evenly. And mixing things evenly is not disorder. A 
<br />
checkerboard pattern exhibits obvious order, until we blend the color of 
<br />
each square perfectly even. This is because each two squares are like 
<br />
the divided apart checkers. Each individual colored square represents a 
<br />
measure of grouping order. Each is a group of colored points. The 
<br />
strange thing is that if we push the order of the checkerboard pattern 
<br />
toward greater balance and uniformity, the appearance of order 
<br />
disappears. The colored squares, like mixing two colors of paint, become 
<br />
one color (like many particles becoming a unified condensate). In fact 
<br />
the order visible in a checkerboard pattern is pronounced only because 
<br />
each square is still a case of grouping order. In greater extreme, the 
<br />
order of a checkerboard becomes smooth and even, plain boring and ugly. 
<br />
We are not accustomed to recognizing a uniform pattern as order. When 
<br />
things balance out, when gases escape confinement and spread throughout 
<br />
the room we say disorder has increased. The available energy has decreased.
<br />
<p>Yes, entropy has increased, but disorder has not increased, because the 
<br />
fact is, there is no such thing as a general disorder. All there is are 
<br />
two types of order which are opposites, and so the order of one type is 
<br />
the disorder of the other type. The disorder of grouping order is 
<br />
symmetry order. The disorder of symmetry order is grouping order. The 
<br />
entire assortment of imaginable patterns available to the passage of 
<br />
time are created only by mixing together grouping and symmetry.
<br />
<p>To explain this, imagine setting up checkers, except the goal of the 
<br />
game is to move the pieces from opposite sides one at a time until the 
<br />
game piece colors match up with the checkerboard colors. We are moving 
<br />
the game pieces from grouping order to symmetry order, and in between 
<br />
the two opposing directions of order we find ourselves in what appears 
<br />
at first to be disordered states. There are many unique patterns. 
<br />
However, notice that in moving any piece in any direction, you either 
<br />
increase grouping order or increase symmetry order. You can only move 
<br />
away from like colored pieces to improve the overall symmetry order of 
<br />
the pattern or toward like colored pieces to create greater grouping 
<br />
order. In the same way, the universe can only expand or contract. We can 
<br />
either divide things apart or blend them together. Systems don't move 
<br />
from order to disorder. They move from grouping to symmetry. We are just 
<br />
not accustomed to recognizing the plain, boring, ugly, order of extreme 
<br />
uniformity, balance, and symmetry as order. Dr. Lin has come the closest 
<br />
to uncovering this model that I am aware of.
<br />
<p>Of course Lauri, all this applies to music or sound very easily. Any 
<br />
note is grouping order. An even rhythm of notes is symmetry order. One 
<br />
steady tone is like one color of paint, it is symmetry order except for 
<br />
the tone itself, which is grouping order, as it is above silence. 
<br />
Silence is extreme symmetry order. White noise is symmetry order. Two 
<br />
quick beats is greater grouping order. The crescendo is a strong mix of 
<br />
both grouping and symmetry, with all the instrument noises together, the 
<br />
opposition to silence, being grouping, but each instrument playing at 
<br />
the same time is also a measure of symmetry. Now it should be easy to 
<br />
see that a drum has less symmetry by nature than a violin.
<br />
<p>The nature of grouping order is division, separation, distinction, 
<br />
individuality, density, pronunciation, opposition, and conflict. 
<br />
Symmetry order involves balance, integration, combination, uniformity, 
<br />
homogeneity, singularity, formlessness, symmetry, and unity. The two 
<br />
orders reflect two basic natures in the Universe, and also two 
<br />
directions of increase that are opposite to one another. We can easily 
<br />
find these two orders as conflicting influences in nature, in society, 
<br />
in psychology, in politics. Republicans versus the democrats. 
<br />
Conservative verus Liberal. This polarization is different from positive 
<br />
versus negative, white or black, which is within grouping order itself. 
<br />
This conflict is past versus future.
<br />
<p>Fundamentally the self, anything definitive and pronounced, is grouping 
<br />
order. The self relative to the many, one group relative to the whole, 
<br />
is a fundamental theme in literature and movies. Clubs, states, 
<br />
countries, race, class, interests, are all ways that we group together. 
<br />
Sometimes those groups clash with eachother. Sometimes they clash with 
<br />
the whole. Anything indefinite, uniformity, neutrality, zero, empty 
<br />
space, is symmetry order. Symmetry order is not the cancellation of 
<br />
sides, it is the combination of parts into a whole. Everything in the 
<br />
frig thrown in a pot and cooked for ten hours becomes a uniform whole. 
<br />
The universe isn't getting smaller, it is getting larger, becoming 
<br />
whole. The funny things is, in understanding order properly, one 
<br />
realizes that if anything is disorder, it is the imbalances of grouping 
<br />
order, the past. Symmetry is actually the truest order. So the universe 
<br />
is actually becoming more ordered, becoming one.
<br />
<p>The spiral structure of a galaxy exhibits obvious symmetry, but the 
<br />
grouping of stars into that galaxy as opposed to an even distribution 
<br />
throughout space is obviously grouping order. To understand how the big 
<br />
bang represents the extreme of grouping order we have to consider the 
<br />
process of setting up the checkerboard, and recognize that the universe 
<br />
is characterized by positively and negatively charged particles. The 
<br />
point of the big bang is not simply all matter collapsed into a dense 
<br />
point. It is all the positives separated from all negatives. It is 
<br />
positively charged matter, the protons, separated from all the 
<br />
negatively charged matter, the mirror anti-protons. In essence what I am 
<br />
saying is that the point of the big bang is merely half of the whole. 
<br />
And so there is a mirror universe, identical to our own, except it 
<br />
begins from a negatively charged big bang. In reference to our universe, 
<br />
it is made of anti-matter. The entire process of time involves the 
<br />
matter from one side invading the other, in particle form as the 
<br />
electron point particles that cannot be spatially extended in our 
<br />
positive space, and also uniformly which is what is causing each 
<br />
universe to expand larger. The process is like opposite sides of a chess 
<br />
game invading each other, until only the uniformity and balance of the 
<br />
checkerboard is left behind, on the surface.
<br />
<p>Applying the transformation of grouping order into symmetry order to 
<br />
cosmology in general is involved but the result is no less complex than 
<br />
applying relativity to the structure of space-time. What before seemed 
<br />
incomprehensible turns into a very descriptive model of understanding. 
<br />
Things like, why is there so much matter and no anti-matter, or why is 
<br />
the proton so large compared to the tiny electron point particle, 
<br />
suddenly make sense. Why does time begin with a bang and always travel 
<br />
toward zero? Because zero is the cosmic balance point, the point of 
<br />
perfect symmetry. Omega zero is the balanced whole, the timeless 
<br />
infinite Universe.
<br />
<p>That is an explanation of two orders fast and furious. I will be 
<br />
publishing a book this summer. For further reading you are welcome to
