Welcome to the list, Robin!<br><br>

<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">I'm new to this list, so I will
give a brief description of my<br>
background, then a brief account of my understanding of information,<br>
in the hope of eliciting some comments.<br><br>
I have a BA (Hons) in philosophy and psychology and obtained an MSc
in<br>
information technology in 1986. I worked in academic research first
in<br>
computing then computer modelling in environmental economics. I left<br>
academia in 1998 to start my own computer maintenance business, but<br>
health problems over the last 2-3 years have obstructed that, and I<br>
have instead been pursuing my long-standing interest in philosophy
of<br>
mind. Although I've only recently had much time to devote to such<br>
studies, my ideas have been developing over the last 25-30 years,
and<br>
even 3 years ago, I had several tens of thousands of words, though<br>
none of it had ever been published (or even submitted).<br><br>
I have only quite recently become aware of the new field of
philosophy<br>
of information, but I've given a great deal of thought to the place
of<br>
information in phil of mind, and have come to some quite firm<br>
conclusions, on which I'd like to get some feedback. I have already<br>
submitted a conference paper abstract but it hasn't yet been
accepted<br>
so I guess I could retract it if you people manage to convince me<br>
there's a serious error of some sort. What follows is almost
identical<br>
to the abstract.<br><br>
In this paper I combine and extend some ideas of Daniel Dennett with<br>
one from Wittgenstein and another from physics. Dennett introduced
the<br>
concepts of the physical, design and intentional stances (1987), and<br>
has suggested (with John Haugeland) that “some concept of
INFORMATION<br>
could serve eventually to unify mind, matter, and meaning in a
single<br>
theory.” (Dennett and Haugeland, 1987, emphasis in the
original)</blockquote><br>
The most Wittgensteinian approach to intentionality is, in my opinion,
in<br>
Situations and Attitudes by Jon Barwise and John Perry. I think it is
flawed,<br>
as it does not properly incorporate standard logic (this is a problem
that<br>
Jerry Fodor harps on, a bit excessively perhaps, and to the wrong
effect,<br>
but basically he is right). I come more from a Peircean direction, which
takes<br>
standard logic much more seriously in his account of meaning. There is an
<br>
attempt to criticise and integrate the various positions, including
formal<br>
pragmatics in Pragmatist Pragmatics, Collier and Talmont-Kaminski,<br>
Philosophica 75 (2006), available on my website. You might find it <br>
interesting, as it uses information as a central primitive. I find
Dennett's<br>
stances too nominalist for my taste. Dennett might now too, under the
<br>
influence of my colleague and coauthor Don Ross. There is a book<br>
coming out from Oxford before too long, Every Thing Must Go: Metaphysics
<br>
Naturalised by JAMES LADYMAN and DON ROSS with David Spurrett and <br>
John Collier that takes a more realist position on some of Dennett's
work.<br>
It also give an information-theoretic structural realism that does
away<br>
with objects as fundamental metaphysical entities. I can send you a<br>
preprint if you like.<br><br>
There is a nice, accessible account of Barwise and Perry in Keith
Devlin,<br>
Information and Logic.<br><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">The concept of physical
information is now very well established.&nbsp; The famous<br>
bet between physicists Stephen Hawking and John Preskill that Hawking
conceded<br>
he’d lost in July 2004 concerned whether physical information is
conserved in<br>
black holes.&nbsp; (Preskill, 2004) Physical information is basically
material form.<br>
The concept derives from C.E. Shannon’s information theory (1948) and
has no<br>
semantic component.&nbsp; When this concept is taken to its logical
conclusion, an<br>
energy flow becomes an information flow and an object becomes its
own<br>
description.&nbsp; The crucial distinction is between form and
substance.&nbsp; Dennett’s<br>
physical stance could be renamed the “substantial stance,” while I
introduce an<br>
additional stance to account for information, called the “formal
stance,” in<br>
which we attend to form rather than substance.</blockquote><br>
The book mentioned above talks about the material and formal modes,
which<br>
dates back to the early logical empricists (but I would argue it can be
found<br>
in Hertz's philosophy of science -- thanks to Howard Pattee for that). On
energy<br>
flow being information flow, see my Causation is the Transfer of
Information, also<br>
on my website. I am revising it now to incorporate Barwise and Seligman,
Information<br>
Flow. My approach is a special case of their formalism restricted to
dynamical<br>
classes and particulars (types and tokens). After the restriction, the
rest of my<br>
view follows trivially from&nbsp; their formalism. Incidentally, I don't
think that Shannon's<br>
theory is general enough to do the job you require, but I won't go into
the reasons<br>
now, since they would require a rather extended development.<br><br>
You can find my website below, or by goolgling John Collier
complexity.<br><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">The common concept of
information is intentional.&nbsp; Intentional information is<br>
encoded in physical information, being decoded (and re-encoded) in
use.&nbsp; This<br>
is consistent with the Wittgensteinian concept of meaning as use in
context (or<br>
in a “language game” (1972)), where the context is the key.&nbsp;
</blockquote><br>
Quite. John Perry developed this nicely in his Presidential Address to
Western<br>
Division of the American Philosophical Association. He also has a related
article<br>
in <font size=2>Philip Hanson (ed) <i>Information, Language and
Cognition: Vancouver Studies in <br>
Cognitive Science, Vol. 1</i> (University of Oxford Press, 1990)</font>
with David Isreal.<br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">Thus the colour of<br>
an apple is encoded in the characteristics of the light entering the eye
of an<br>
observer, where a tree or a fruit bowl and the pre-existing concept of
“apple”<br>
or “fruit” contribute to the context, and further analysis might
indicate<br>
probable degree of ripeness.&nbsp; Human communications involve
additional levels of<br>
en/decoding and complexity but the same principle of intentional
information<br>
encoded in physical information obtains.&nbsp; Brains encode intentional
information<br>
too, provided that we adopt the formal stance and the intentional
stance<br>
towards them.&nbsp; (The intentional stance actually implies the formal
stance, as<br>
only information can be intentional.)</blockquote><br>
In order to make this out properly, I think you need more than just an
intentional<br>
stance, which seems to me like a deus ex machina in this context. I
reccommend<br>
Peircean semiotics.<br><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">To adopt Dennett’s intentional
stance toward an object is to suppose that the<br>
object encodes intentional information.&nbsp; To adopt his design stance
is to view<br>
something as the product of an intentional information
process.</blockquote><br>
I think Dennett makes the order the opposite of what you say. I think
there are<br>
good reasons for doing it, basically because functionality comes prior
to<br>
intentionality, both logically and historically.<br><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">Though the physical stance is
very natural and practical in many contexts, the<br>
formal stance is superior in a certain sense: information is all that our
senses<br>
convey, we do not experience matter directly, it can be considered a
theoretical<br>
entity (or set of entities).</blockquote><br>
Quite, which is why we pretty much dispense with matter except as <br>
structure in Every Thing Must Go.<br><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">A mind is a user or processor of
intentional information. </blockquote><br>
I am not sure what this means. I can parse it grammatically, <br>
but not logically. <br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">Matter is a<br>
theoretical entity extrapolated from physical information. Meaning
is<br>
intentional information (though multiple levels of en/decoding might<br>
be involved), and consciousness is the use or processing of<br>
intentional information.&nbsp; Thus Dennett’s prediction is
fulfilled.</blockquote><br>
Well, we (Ladyman, Ross, Spurrett, Collier) think it will be!<br><br>
Incidentally, I basically agree with Stan Salthe's remarks on <br>
your post, modulo what I say here, as well.<br><br>
Cheers,<br>
John<br>
