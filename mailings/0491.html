<p>
Dear colleagues:
<br />
<p>It is high time that I enter this discussion. Unfortunately, this
<br />
electronic conference is falling smack right into a difficult period for
<br />
me: it began last week when I was just back in Alaska from several weeks
<br />
in Argentina, and now I am at my regular tour at ICTP in Trieste as senior
<br />
adviser. Add to this the editors of a book screaming for galley proof
<br />
corrections, yesterday's general assembly of the Oesterreichische Akademie
<br />
der Wissenschaften, etc., etc., and I don't know how to make enough room
<br />
in my schedule! 
<br />
<p>Still, I manage to follow with great interest the ongoing discussion. It
<br />
touches on many points raised in the first four sections of my
<br />
contribution (On the Concept of Information and its Role in Nature). I
<br />
realize that my paper is far too long, but I would appreciate it very much
<br />
getting some reactions and criticism from the participants to at least the
<br />
first sections (1-4).
<br />
<p>Concerning the ongoing discussion, let me turn specifically to the issue
<br />
of &quot;Does information play any role in purely physical (non-life)
<br />
interactions?&quot;, or, equivalently, &quot;Was there information before life?&quot;. I
<br />
try in my paper to justify negative answers to both questions. To that
<br />
effect, I refer to the statement by Gyuri Darvas:
<br />
<p>&quot;When interacting with an other object, a physical object will first
<br />
'evaluate' the information .... E.g., a charge recognises the Coulomb
<br />
field of an other charge and will interact with it......&quot;
<br />
<p>I simply cannot accept such language in physics, that uses brain function
<br />
metaphors. What part of the object (or the particle) does the evaluating
<br />
or the recognizing? How long does this process take? The same applies to
<br />
the statement &quot;..a given mass, when it 'feels' a force, cannot make
<br />
distinction that the source of this effect was an other mass (gravitation)
<br />
or an inertia force&quot;? Let me quote here a statement I make in my paper
<br />
(section 3): &quot;Unfortunately, in physics we tend to use anthropomorphic
<br />
analogies and animistic language by saying such things as &quot;the system
<br />
'selects' a path of least action&quot;, &quot;the system 'seeks' a strange
<br />
attractor&quot;, or &quot;the photon 'decided' to go through the left diffraction
<br />
slit&quot;. One needs a BRAIN to select, seek or decide!&quot;. I also say: &quot;In a
<br />
statement like 'the process of cosmic evolution itself generates
<br />
information' (e.g., p. 131 in ref. 3 of my paper) we should realize that
<br />
this is information for us observers--it does not control any of  the
<br />
natural processes involved unless they pertain to living matter. In a
<br />
biological system, indeed, information is an active participant in its own
<br />
organization, behavior and multiplication, and information exists and
<br />
operates in total independence of any outside observer&quot;.
<br />
<p>Of course, we cannot forbid ourselves thinking in these terms--we do it
<br />
all the time. But appealing to the concept of information in a context
<br />
where it is not necessary (while perfectly possible given our cognitive
<br />
apparatus which happens to work with it) is like insisting in the use of a
<br />
clearly defined, but physically meaningless, quantity such as 1/3 mv**3. 
<br />
<p>Please note that in the paper I start my discussion by turning to the
<br />
process if &quot;interaction&quot; (between two given systems) as the departing
<br />
point, as the most basic concept. I feel that only in this way can one
<br />
avoid several semantic and subjective difficulties--as happened when Ernst
<br />
Mach introduced it in fundamental Newtonian dynamics.
<br />
<p>Looking forward to further comments,
<br />
<p>Cheers, Juan
<br />
