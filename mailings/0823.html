<p>
dear colleagues, dear friends,
<br />
<p>as i have the honor to give the kickoff for another session, in which i
<br />
want you to discuss the contrubutions of john holgate, m. burgin, gottfried
<br />
stockinger and elohimjl, i will try to provoke exchange of points of view
<br />
by the following interventions.
<br />
<p>at a first glance holgate and burgin discuss rather information in general,
<br />
stockinger and elohim discuss information within society. at a second
<br />
glance, however, the first two colleagues seem to talk about human
<br />
information only, while the latter seem to have in mind information
<br />
processes going on also beyond the realm of humans though they differ in
<br />
how to make the difference between human and extra-human information.
<br />
<p>let's take john h.'s actually peripatetic work. in the first half of his
<br />
contribution he undertakes a deconstruction of the information concept
<br />
after which he leaves the reader confused, albeit on a higher level. in the
<br />
second part he tries to develop 10 principles from the syntax perspective.
<br />
reading them, i got the impression, information is something about which we
<br />
can reason only in the context of human mind. john, is this intended? do
<br />
you think a unified theory of information can only be applied to the sphere
<br />
of humans?
<br />
<p>and let's take the 2 contributions of m. burgin. the author claims to have
<br />
developed a general theory of information. the second paper develops
<br />
ontological principles. one of the first states information to be seen in
<br />
relation to some system and, more specific, to some change of the system.
<br />
but the examples that are given later to illustrate various ontological
<br />
statements stem from the sphere of society and individuals. hence my
<br />
question (as before): is the system of the first principles meant to be a
<br />
human system exclusively?
<br />
<p>stockinger focuses on social information processes as distinct from
<br />
(pre-human) biotic information processes. he points out that autopoiesis
<br />
gets a new feature when climbing up the ladder from living systems to
<br />
social systems. this new feature is an increase in the degrees of freedom,
<br />
manifested in the system's ability to create its enviromment and create
<br />
itself. the recent developments towards information or communication
<br />
society pushed forward by technological drive - do you think, godó, it is a
<br />
natural, an automatic, process that leads to ever more (degrees of)
<br />
freedom? do global challenges not confront humanity with possible
<br />
extinction?
<br />
<p>elohim opens an anthropological perspective beginning with antropogenesis
<br />
and is, contrary to stockinger, very doubtful about the ethical worth of
<br />
information. he seems to be a technological pessimist when being convinced
<br />
that information processes - contrary to the world of animals - in the
<br />
world of humans were functionalised for allowing one part of society
<br />
dominate another part. elohim, where is positive thinking? does the
<br />
evolution of information processing from pre-human stages up to the stage
<br />
of the information revolution merely represent a oneway to extinction?
<br />
<p>in my view, the quest for a unified theory of information is inextricably
<br />
linked to the reflection of complex problems as they have been arising in
<br />
the course of human evolution.
<br />
<p>now, let's try to come to a third glance of the papers!
<br />
<p>cheers,
