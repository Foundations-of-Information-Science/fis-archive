<p>
&nbsp;Dear FIS colleagues:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Let me join you in thanking Pedro for the wonderful effort of keeping the
<br />
virtual conference going. I am personnaly pleased with the results, which
<br />
appear to be unveil many important issues and questions in this
<br />
fascinating field.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;The issue of conciousness seems to lie in the confluence of many
<br />
viewpoints and ideas. An important thread, in my opinion, seeks to answer
<br />
questions concerning the differences between the types of information
<br />
processing, or computation, as it occurs at different scales (i.e. M.
<br />
Conrad's micro-, meso-, and macro-scales), as well as at different levels
<br />
of biological organization (i.e. sub-atomic, atomic, molecular, organ,
<br />
organism, population, community).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;The issue of consciousness could be studied not only from the standpoint
<br />
of humans, but that of animal behavior as well, as Morris proposes. Allan
<br />
Combs idea of the brain as a system at the boundary between
<br />
information-driven dynamics and energetically-driven dynamics is
<br />
intriguing. A broad notion of computation that includes as such the action
<br />
of physical processes, would consider both one and the same, although
<br />
would allow for both to coexist, for example, in artificial &quot;brains&quot;.
<br />
Would they coexist also in the human brain, or a biological brain? I
<br />
really do not know.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Are human groups and societies conscious as such? Are only their human
<br />
elements conscious, individually? Rafael Cappurro's reference to
<br />
Heidegger's view that being-in-the-world means not only to be in this
<br />
planet, but to be part of an open network of relationships between
<br />
&quot;things,&quot; followed by his fascinating question of how far other living
<br />
beings  also live in such networks I think is very much to the point.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;In answering these questions, or in attempting to answer them, we could
<br />
find definite ways of relating artificial computing and natural computing
<br />
so that the former complements the latter effectively, as I suggest it
<br />
can be done in the FIS96 issue of BioSystems.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Well, this is just a thread. M. Conrad's principle of philosophical
<br />
relativity may help us to relate different viewpoints to each other and, 
<br />
as he says: still maintaining the essence of empirical or logical result.   
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Roberto R. Kampfner
