Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>here there are some replies to Peter's tricky questions (apparently simple,
<br />
but quite demanding as a home work):
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. Werner Ebeling states in his eights statement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;**********************************************
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Information can be created by selforganization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*********************************************
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Question 1: How this statment appears in the cellular, whole brain, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;firm level ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>In my opinion, Werner's statement is overstretching the elegant views he
<br />
develops on dynamic entropies (what an excellent work on higher order
<br />
correlations within info carriers!). Close by, his distinction between free
<br />
&amp; bound info, although anthropocentricly interesting, becomes unclear for
<br />
the living cell. For instance, both the sequential info of DNA and the
<br />
'amorphous' architectures of enzyme networks and enzyme gradients would
<br />
become lumped together. And how they relate to cell signaling would be
<br />
quite unclear... But at least his view is sophisticate enough, as there is
<br />
a trend to cover with only one info category the whole cellular
<br />
info-occurrences. On this matter I would like to emphasize that crucial
<br />
current bioinformatic disciplines --genomics, proteomics, signaling
<br />
science-- dovetail with the three info genera proposed in these discussions
<br />
almost 5 years ago. Quite often scientific action goes in advance of
<br />
scientific reflection. I mean, pragmatic considerations alone should lead
<br />
us to a very serious contemplation of the current bioinformatic
<br />
(bioinformation) revolution... Anyhow, if the initial statement refers only
<br />
to the origins of life, I also tend to disagree: we still lack crucial
<br />
pieces of the puzzle. (What about 'panspermia': life as a cosmic
<br />
phenomenon?). 
<br />
<p>About brains, well, Juan makes some important claims. Also there was a
<br />
recent posting by Terry which was addressing iterative dynamics and
<br />
reentry... So, I would agree with the self.org. statement, provided there
<br />
is room for realizing how many poorly understood aspects are left out of
<br />
the picture: 'intelligent interconnecting architectures', roles of
<br />
evolutionary old structures, memory, emotions, consciousness, language,
<br />
qualia, etc., without forgetting the enormous background of molecular
<br />
intelligence involved (hormones, neuropeptides, etc.)
<br />
<p>About firms, a clearer 'yes'. My hunch is that they constitute the easiest
<br />
place to conceptualize the paradoxical 'evenescent permanence' which
<br />
characterizes genuinely informational entities, provided that we achieve a
<br />
conceptual leap beyond the trivial interpretation of the curious varieties
<br />
of INFO the enterprise' structures endlessly produce and process. For
<br />
instance, the double entry book-keeping system, plus the 'Account of
<br />
Results' (sorry I directly translate from Spanish) are social inventions of
<br />
info nature: they allow participation in the 'invisible hand' planning of
<br />
markets. Plus the cannon of power laws (partitions?) which smoothly emerges
<br />
out from the mature interaction with the competitive environment... 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Juan Roederer mentions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;***************************************************************************
</em><br />
****
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This brings up a new element in information-processing, namely that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decision-making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*****************************************************************************
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Questions 2: How natural and artificial decision making systems process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and create information?
</em><br />
<p>Juan's paper is a scholarly piece. I agree with his initial emphasis on the
<br />
difference between info interactions and physical ones (although a broad
<br />
sense of info has to be attributed and respected for every one of the
<br />
consolidated uses of the term in other classical disciplines--Werner made a
<br />
good point about that days ago-- notwithstanding the strict sense each one
<br />
of us may particularly champion). On neuronal matters I miss the crucial
<br />
role seemingly played by the thalamocortical 'dialog' (eg, Edelman,
<br />
Llinás), because this could be the basic mechanism of 'attention' (the
<br />
heart of this Q2 motif). Attempting a generalization:
<br />
<p>-- artificial systems have to rely on SPECIFICATION (a previous instruction
<br />
by the human makers on what is, or is not, info for them), implying a
<br />
terrible limitation of domains and functional brittleness, eg,
<br />
artif.intelligence systems as 'idiot savants'.
<br />
<p>-- while living systems would operate by ABDUCTION. Both cellular signaling
<br />
systems and nervous systems have the capacity (the wisdom!) to eliminate a
<br />
lot of the irrelevant surrounding info and concentrate only on a single
<br />
item (or a few ones) of relevance. Here, the posting by John days ago on
<br />
the very relative role of energy differences in cell comm. was quite right
<br />
in my opinion (for instance, some crucial steroids, morphogens, and
<br />
hormones... directly enter into the nucleus, without any previous
<br />
processing, while opsins of the visual system, acompanied by G proteins,
<br />
adenyl ciclase, AMPc, chains of protein kinases, etc. migt achieve
<br />
magnifications of the order of... 10 exp 10, or even more, as just one
<br />
photon produces neuronal depolarization). Biological communication, and the
<br />
related decision-making, becomes dramatically decoupled from its energy
<br />
counterparts.       
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. Ted Goranson's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;************************************************************************
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;work is in modeling the behavior of complex business enterprises,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;primarily those that make stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;***********************************************************************
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q3. Can we accumulate arguments that to manage and control complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;business enterprises, a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Information Science is neccessary??
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>Ted makes some brief points on the vertical scheme (of multilevel info
<br />
flow) that I much share, particularly the asymmetry between the up and down
<br />
views on the same info 'phase transition'. For the sake of discussion, my
<br />
point is that directly modelling the intra-firms, or inter-firms production
<br />
&amp; business complex procecesses would place our fis 'infoeconomy' views into
<br />
a very difficult alley. That task is the basic stuff for many
<br />
(sophisticate) research groups close to the complexity and econophysics
<br />
views. 
<br />
<p>Our general views, however, may be interesting to pay attention to current
<br />
non-trivial challenges, such as the nature of the firm, the 'value'
<br />
conceptualization, the 'invisible hand' foundations, the info nature of
<br />
accounting practices and its historical emergence side by side with
<br />
scientific book-keeping (eg. Toledo and Tarazona Schools of Translation,
<br />
Fibonacci, Luca Paccioli, Durero, Lavoisier; by the way, Sánchez Vidal, of
<br />
this list has a beatiful essay about all this, although in Spanish), also
<br />
the power law cannon (partitions and number theory underlying Pareto´s law
<br />
and Zipf's law?), and let us also remember the many discussions --and
<br />
several recent Nobel prizes-- about economic information, transactions, and
<br />
the functioning of markets and of stock exchanges. Finally, the unaccounted
<br />
value of Nature's resources and processes by economic markets is a dramatic
<br />
contemporary problem, that in my view can only be tackled by putting both
<br />
universes, the natural and the artificial, on a common info ground... So,
<br />
Michael was quite right: in fis infoeconomy we cannot forget the ultimate
<br />
relationship of human info with the natural niche. 
<br />
