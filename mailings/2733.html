Dear colleagues, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I agree with most of what is said, but it does not apply to social systems
<br />
because these -- and to a lesser extent also psychological ones -- operate
<br />
differently from the hierarchical formations that are generated &quot;naturally&quot;.
<br />
That is why we oppose &quot;nature&quot; to &quot;culture&quot; in the semantics: cultural (and
<br />
social) systems enable us to model the systems under study and this changes
<br />
the hierarchical order. I understand that Maturana et al. argue that the
<br />
next-order systems always model the lower-order ones, but then the word
<br />
&quot;model&quot; is used metaphorically. The model (e.g., the biological) model
<br />
enables us to reconstruct the system(s) under study to such an extent that
<br />
we are able to intervene in these systems, e.g. by using a technology. This
<br />
inverts the hierarchy.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thus, let me write in Stan's notation: biological {psychological {social}}
<br />
-- or is this precisely the opposite order, Stan? -- then our scientific
<br />
models enable us to change nature, for example, by building dykes like in
<br />
Holland and thus we get: social {biological} since the ecological changes
<br />
can also be planned in advance. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
While lower-order systems are able to entertain a model of the next-lower
<br />
ones -- and even have to entertain a model -- human language enables us not
<br />
only to exchange these models, but also to study them and to further codify
<br />
them. The further codification sharpens the knife with which we can cut into
<br />
the lower-level ones. We are not constrained to the next-order lower level,
<br />
but we can freely move through the hierarchy and develop different
<br />
specialties accordingly (chemistry, biology, etc.). Scientists are able to
<br />
adjust the focus of the lense. This is a cultural achievement which was
<br />
generated naturally, but once in place also had the possibility to
<br />
distinguish between genesis and validity. No lower-level systems can raise
<br />
and begin to answer this question. And doubling reality into a semantic
<br />
domain that can operate relatively independently of the underlying
<br />
(represented) layer increases the complexity which can be absorbed with an
<br />
order of magnitude.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The issue is heavily related to the issue of modernity as a specific form of
<br />
social organization. While tribes (&quot;small groups&quot;) can still be considered
<br />
using the &quot;natural&quot; metaphor, and high cultures were still organized
<br />
hierarchically (with the emperor or the pope at the top), modern social
<br />
systems set science &quot;free&quot; to pursue this reconstruction in a
<br />
techno-economic evolution. &quot;All that is solid, will melt into air&quot; (Marx).
<br />
Because of our biological body, we are part of nature, but our minds are
<br />
entrained in a cultural dynamics at the supra-individual level (&quot;culture&quot;)
<br />
which feeds back and at some places is able increasingly to invert the
<br />
hierarchy. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With best wishes, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<p><p>Hi folks,
<br />
<p>I'll take a few minutes from my moving and dealing with academic emergencies
<br />
at UKZN to make a comment here.
<br />
<p>Jerry brings up a point that keeps arising in the literature one constraints
<br />
and information. Recall that Shannon said that they are the same thing. That
<br />
is a clue.
<br />
<p>Loet and I dealt with this issue previously on this list about a year ago
<br />
when he claimed that social communications channels open up new
<br />
possibilities (analogous to Jerry's position here), and I asked him why this
<br />
was so, since any further structure must reduce the possibilities, not
<br />
increase them. We each promoted out view for a while, and then stopped, as
<br />
it wasn't going anywhere. The reason is that there is nowhere to go with
<br />
this issue. Both positions are correct, and they do not contradict each
<br />
other; they are merely incompatible perspectives, much like Cartesian versus
<br />
polar coordinates. The positions are not logically incompatible, but
<br />
pragmatically incompatible, in that they cannot both be adopted at the same
<br />
time. This is a fairly common phenomenon in science. In fact I wrote my
<br />
dissertation on it. There is a paper of mine, Pragmatic Incommensurability,
<br />
in the Proceedings of the Philosophy of Science Association 1984 (PSA 1984)
<br />
that goes into the issue in more detail, but not as much as in my thesis. I
<br />
am kind of bored with the issue at the issue at this point, but it keeps
<br />
coming up, so I'll say a bit more.
<br />
<p>Stan's bracket formulation is a logical restriction (constraint), with the
<br />
outer bracketed items logically restricting the inner ones. It is a neat
<br />
formulation for a system developed by W.E. Johnson in his book Logic, in
<br />
which he called the inner elements determinates and the outer ones
<br />
determinables. The idea is a basic one in the Philosophy business, and these
<br />
are the technical terms used there, although they are somewhat awkward,
<br />
being relative terms, and also not words used with their English meaning.
<br />
Jerry's problem is that if the chemical opens up a huge range of
<br />
possibilities not available to the physical, how can we call the physical a
<br />
constraint on the chemical. I once asked Stan a similar question, and he
<br />
gave me an answer that satisfied me enough not to pursue the issue. The
<br />
answer requires a distinction concerning constraints (which, recall, is
<br />
logically equivalent to information -- any connotative difference being
<br />
irrelevant to my point here). My colleagues and coauthors Wayne Christensen
<br />
and Cliff Hooker once referred to the difference between restricting and
<br />
enabling constraints. The former restrict possibilities, while the latter
<br />
are required in order to make things possible -- mush produces nothing. But
<br />
there is no essential difference -- context, if anything, makes the
<br />
difference. I say 'if anything' because in many cases constraints
<br />
(indistinguishable from information by logic alone) do both: restrict and
<br />
enable. There is no paradox here -- they are two sides of the same coin. A
<br />
Taoist like me sees them as Yin and Yang -- the Yang element is the defined
<br />
and restrictive, active, controlling part, while the Yin is the open,
<br />
receptive and enabling part. We cannot view the same thing as both Yin and
<br />
Yang at the same time (we can talk about it in the abstract, in the same way
<br />
that we can talk about Cartesian and polar coordinates together, and even
<br />
transform them on in to the other), but the thing itself is both, and the
<br />
transformations between Yin and Yang have a logical form that is predictable
<br />
and determinate. Just so with restricting and enabling constraints -- we can
<br />
learn to transform one into the other, both in thought and in practice. 
<br />
<p>I will now demonstrate this with Jerry's cases (though the ideas are hardly
<br />
peculiar to Jerry's cases)

<p>Genetic networks are not an amalgam of soft concepts, rather a genetic

The enumeration of the creative  genetic network is complete for some

<p>In Aristotelian logical terms, the position of the species is between the

It is the chemical capacity to create species that I find to be absent from

<br />
<p>Thus, I would re-phrase your  hypothesis generating sentence:

<br />

<br />
<p><p>To:
<br />
<p>&quot;I was referring to the hypothesis that genetic networks have the creative
<br />
capacity to function in very large associations that are linked together by
<br />
very weak bonds.&quot;
<br />
<p><p>There is no difference between the two statements -- the scope in the 'from'
<br />
case is the Yang side of things, but in the 'to' case it is the Yin side.
<br />
One pays attention to the Yang aspects, and the other to the Yin aspects.
<br />
Both propensities are there, and the stronger the Yang propensity the more
<br />
it transforms into the Yin, and vice versa. Given a finite information
<br />
capacity, these are the only two possible dynamics, and they trade off
<br />
against each other. Now, if we have an expanding information capacity (phase
<br />
space), as Kaufman, Brooks and Wiley, Layzer, Landserg, Frautschi, Davies
<br />
and other notables have seen, we can get both together, though they still
<br />
trade off one against the other. 
<br />
<p><p><p>Ted's comment seems to be based on a some recent innovations in the
<br />
mathematics of hierarchies.  The issue of how we select the meaning for our
<br />
symbols of representations of the world can be a very complicated one.  The
<br />
profound limitations that linear and quasi - linear mathematics places on
<br />
the symbolic carrying capacity of signs may be relevant to Ted's statement.
<br />
But, I am not certain of the origins of his views.
<br />
<p><p>Jerry, I think the way this is worded is not quite consistent with the
<br />
perspective you are promoting. We don't &quot;select&quot; the meaning of our symbols,
<br />
except perhaps in fairly formal contexts. If we did it would be very hard to
<br />
be usefully creative, I am sure you agree -- we could only select what we
<br />
already have a template for -- see my Dealing with the Unexpected from the
<br />
CASYS meetings examples.
<br />
<p><p><p>Stan's comment deserves to be attended to.
<br />
<p>&quot;The many
<br />
complexities facing us as society can be parsed as follows, using a
<br />
specification hierarcy:
<br />
{physical constraints (material/chemical constraints {biological
<br />
constraints {sociocultural constraints}}}}.&quot;
<br />
<p>As I search for the substance in this comment, I  focus on what might be the
<br />
potentially misleading usage of the term &quot;parsed.&quot;   Nor, do I understand
<br />
why brackets, signifiers of separations, are used in this context. 
<br />
I have no idea what it would mean to &quot;parse&quot; a &quot;material / chemical
<br />
constraint&quot; in this context.
<br />
<p><p>See note on W.E. Johnson above. That is the standard source for the logic
<br />
here, and it is universally accepted among those who know it.
<br />
<p><p><p>Indeed, chemical logic functions in exactly the opposite direction.  
<br />
<p>The creative relations grow with the complexity of the system.  Is this not
<br />
what we mean by evolution? 
<br />
<p><p>But so do the constraints or restrictions, as Stan has been arguing for
<br />
years now. There is no inconsistency in both happening.
<br />
<p><p><p>On a personal note to Stan: We have been discussing similar concepts since
<br />
the inception of WESS more than 20 years ago and it does not appear that we
<br />
are converging!  :-)  :-)  :-)    Unless you choose to embrace the creative
<br />
capacities of chemical logic, I fear your mind is doomed to the purgatory of
<br />
unending chaotic cycles, searching for a few elusive or perhaps imaginary
<br />
&quot;fixed points.&quot;  ;-)  :-)        :-( !!!
<br />
<p><p><p>And there is no convergence. There are fixed points -- there have to be or
<br />
all we can have is mush -- but they are not where the action is. On the
<br />
other hand, the 'action' occurs only because of receptivity to  being worked
<br />
on or guided by constraints that must relatively fixed. The divergence is
<br />
there in reality, and the place where there is convergence is beyond our
<br />
ability to grasp with an argument. I am sure that Stan knows this.
