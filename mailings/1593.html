<p>
Dear FIS,
<br />
<p>let me summarise what I have tried to bring across this year:
<br />
<p>a) there are two aspects to information: WHAT and WHEN. Usually, one treats
<br />
the confluence of what-when or when-what as an information. Information does
<br />
concsit of pointing out a connection between a realisation of {what} and a
<br />
realisation of {when}. (Like in the Shannon algorithm, one points out {0|1}
<br />
is on place {1,2,3,...i...,n}.)
<br />
b) The WHEN can also be understood as Where. (I point to each of the
<br />
positions for a digit in a binary number and when my finder is there then
<br />
the conncetion is established between how and when/where.)
<br />
c) The WHAT can also be understood as as How. (The things I point out are an
<br />
answer to a What question, but I can point out the same object by describing
<br />
how it is similar or dissimilar to objects already known.)
<br />
d) Entropy can be understood as a process and as well as a state. If we say
<br />
&quot;this collection will entropy in a few days&quot; we mean that it shall be devoid
<br />
of specifics and will have become a mesh of yecch. Each subsystem shall have
<br />
become more similar to all other subsystems then presently. If we say &quot;this
<br />
state is the entropic state&quot; we mean that for whatever change in the state
<br />
of the assembly we shall need energy. By itself, it shall remain so. It has
<br />
already arrived at a state which we casll entropied state.
<br />
e) Then, we again match What (here: how) to When. It is important to
<br />
understand that we always talk about a state turning (evolving, becoming,
<br />
proceeding) in a matter of a few steps into a different state, in the case
<br />
of entropy the most durable state.
<br />
f) We all know that usually the usual things remain stable. It would be a
<br />
surprise if something quite usual terminated prematurely or remained in a
<br />
prolonged state of being so. We know the expected life spans of milk, bread,
<br />
fish, news, heat, a cold, a sorrow, a pleasure, a pot of flowers, a day, a
<br />
month, a year. In relation to WHAT we talk about we assign a WHEN it shall
<br />
have ended being so. This without any discussion, as we have all learnt this
<br />
intellectual capacity before we have learnt to speak: so we of course don't
<br />
talk about the scientific discovery that in dependence of HOW a thing is
<br />
made up there is a quite well circumscribed expectation horizon WHEN it
<br />
shall have become different. The HOW points out the thing against the
<br />
collection of any other thing that can be HOW and the WHEN points out the
<br />
assigned end of expected life span of this thing among all possible WHENs.
<br />
g) I firmly believe that mathematics can help making a model of our
<br />
surroundings and in case we do have a model of our surroundings it can help
<br />
makig that model transportable across individual items of our surroundings.
<br />
(If I know how many 5 apples are, I can also count 5 children.)
<br />
h) Therefore, I suggest that we look into the matter of WHAT and WHEN.
<br />
i) Comparing all possible instances of individual combinations of WHATs
<br />
(collections of semantic differentials modi Chomsky) we can distinguish 1.
<br />
how many pieces this collection is made up of, 2. how many of these pieces
<br />
are alike.
<br />
j) We open up a new numeric approach by counting the number of differing
<br />
pieces an assembly is made up of, rather than the overall number of pieces
<br />
an assembly is made up of. We then find that number of differing pieces of
<br />
an assembly is in itself a discriminating descriptor, even regardless of the
<br />
overall size of the assembly (although there exists an interdependence
<br />
between overall size of an assembly and the number of pieces is is most
<br />
probably made up of).
<br />
k) The durability of a state is how many steps it will remain so as it is.
<br />
If the state is a probably one, there shall be a large number of steps the
<br />
state shall remain so.
<br />
l) We can reconstruct the WHAT dimension of an assembly from its WHEN data
<br />
and the WHEN dimension from its HOW data.
<br />
m) This regardless of the absolute size (more or less).
<br />
I shall keep repeating these tautologies because I am convinced that they
<br />
show a very important tool to model interdependence of systems with.

Betreff: Re: [Fis] 2004 FIS session: concluding comments
<br />
<p><p>Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>I have been very busy during last months with courses, projects and things
<br />
like that ---far less interesting than the present discussion.  Unluckily,
<br />
I was unable to participate in this exciting session. But fortunately, as
<br />
Michel remarked, we can retrieve the postings and the discussion from the
<br />
FIS site.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like just to make a very brief comment about entropy and
<br />
information in my own field. As many of you already know from the past fis
<br />
session on sustainable development, my specialization is on thermoeconomic
<br />
analysis. It is an energy analysis, based on the Second Law of
<br />
thermodynamics (entropy), suitable to be applied to complex factories and
<br />
industrial systems. It studies how the resources consumed in an industrial
<br />
plant are distributed among the different pieces of equipment and how much
<br />
they participate in the final product(s) formation. In other words, it
<br />
allows to evaluate and analyze the process of cost formation (amount of
<br />
energy consumed for producing a product) throughout the analysis of the
<br />
interactions of the different plant units and throughout the entropy
<br />
generated in each physical equipment.
<br />
<p>I agree with Pedro, in some private discussions that we have had in the
<br />
past, that this is a typical informational problem in which there is a neat
<br />
connection between entropy generation and creation of economic information.
<br />
In the thermoeconomic analysis, we study how the energy quality (exergy),
<br />
which is in very close connection with entropy generation, is degraded in
<br />
its flow along the productive process and as a consequence an economic
<br />
input (information) is created. I think that the methodology of this
<br />
thermoeconomic analysis is very systematic and formal, and might be
<br />
generalized and applied to other fields, to tentatively analyze, with
<br />
appropriate measurable magnitudes, the generation and distribution of some
<br />
&quot;information&quot; throughout the structure &amp; processes of a system consisting
<br />
of different &quot;components&quot; or &quot;pieces of equipment&quot; in mutual interaction.
<br />
<p>During the vacational period I will retrieve all your comments in this very
<br />
exciting session that I have missed!
<br />
<p>Best regards to everybody
<br />
<p>Luis
