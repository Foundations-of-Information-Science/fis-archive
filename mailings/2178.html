Dear Loet,
<br />
<p>I have pointed out that this is exactly the area where I think the term 
<br />
information is overloaded in common use and needs clarification.
<br />
<p>When we use the terminology &quot;a /informs /b&quot; we mean one convention 
<br />
contributes to another - which appears quite different from the formal 
<br />
Shannon meaning.  This is because the term has in fact evolved along 
<br />
quite separate paths - one in mathematics / computational science 
<br />
(/informatique/), the other in philosophy / language and communication 
<br />
studies.
<br />
<p>I have argued that we cannot define the term /information /in isolation. 
<br />
We really must make our model, our context, clear.
<br />
<p>In my own definition of the term *information *I mean /that which 
<br />
identifies cause and contributes to knowledge/ but I have this kludge 
<br />
around the definition of the term *knowledge *that allows me to 
<br />
generalize and include mechanics - I mentioned this earlier as something 
<br />
that I occasionally feel uncomfortable about. :-)
<br />
<p>Recall I define *knowledge *as /the determinant of action/.  So, in 
<br />
semeiosis, knowledge is in the /information/ that/ /is /embodied /in the 
<br />
set of /meaning/* *(itself the /embodiment /of traces of prior 
<br />
semeiosis) that determines the behavior of an organism.  In mechanics it 
<br />
is the set of /information/* */embodied /in prior cause that determines 
<br />
behavior - and I refer to this set as *super-knowledge*.  Which, as I 
<br />
say, occasionally makes me uncomfortable, partly because at first it 
<br />
seems so cheesy. Think of it as unmediated knowledge.
<br />
<p>The primary distinction between the two - and this is why I did it in 
<br />
the first place - is that physically /one //deals with the engineering 
<br />
of sentience and the other deals with mechanics/ - one involves sentient 
<br />
physical structures formed around my notion of the affective 
<br />
primitive-of-experience and the other does not.  But the roles of both 
<br />
fit the same definition - they are both/ determinants of action/ and 
<br />
this feels far from cheesy. It allows me to generalize and unify my 
<br />
definitions of knowledge and behavior.
<br />
<p>So, by the above you can see how I can use the term /information /in 
<br />
both cases.  Since *information *is that which identifies cause and 
<br />
contributes to knowledge (including super-knowledge).  It is how 
<br />
sentient and mechanical things know what to do next :-)
<br />
<p>At the purely physical level - /in both cases, beit the engineering of 
<br />
sentience or mechanics/ - information is physical /difference/ and it 
<br />
identifies cause and contributes to knowledge.
<br />
<p>When I say embodied, I mean exactly embodiment in the engineered 
<br />
physiology of organism.   Everything above reduces to a physical 
<br />
embodiment - /the only element that is not a part of currently accepted 
<br />
physical models is the primitive-of-experience described earlier/.  
<br />
Meaning (and all memory) is the experience-of the physiological traces 
<br />
that are the product of prior semeiosis - itself an embodied physical 
<br />
process - not the product of simple mechanics but /the product of the 
<br />
engineering of sentience by natural selection in nature around the inert 
<br />
primitive-of-experience/. 
<br />
<p>When I use the term *consciousness *I define it as the &quot;conspiracy&quot; 
<br />
between physiology and this primitive.  Physiology characterizes sense 
<br />
in the high-order experiences we are familiar with, semeiosis is the 
<br />
ongoing recursive internal process that takes input directly as sense 
<br />
and from the/ internal sense/ of embodied traces of prior semeiosis.
<br />
<p>Uncertainty and misunderstanding in communication between sentient 
<br />
entities is simply the mismatch of embodied conventions.
<br />
<p>Information processing in this model has two forms - Turing / Shannon 
<br />
computation and semeiosis - Again, one is the product of simple 
<br />
mechanics, the other is the product of sentience engineering - the 
<br />
source of all complexity.
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven

&gt; Dear Steven,
&gt;  
&gt; Do you mean with &quot;embodied&quot; embodiments in biological bodies or in 
&gt; bodies of knowledge. I find it very difficult to understand that 
&gt; meaning has to be embodied if this is meant biologically. However, I 
&gt; can accept that meaning is systemic and thus potentially different 
&gt; among bodies of knowledge.
&gt;  
&gt; How does this relate to information processing? If one distinguishes 
&gt; between (Shannon-type) information processing and meaning-processing 
&gt; (e.g., in the generation of knowledge), the uncertainty has to be 
&gt; positioned within the meaning processing system as meaningful 
&gt; information (different from Shannon-type information). Investing 
&gt; meaning to an information can then be considered as an operation of 
&gt; the selecting system. The operation is recursive: some meanings are 
&gt; more meaningful than others given a body of knowledge. Knowledge can 
&gt; again be communicated as discursive knowledge.
&gt;  
&gt; This is all relatively independent of the bodies involved. They 
&gt; provide the historical conditions for an evolutionary process of 
&gt; expectations operating selectively upon one another. Of course, the 
&gt; historical conditions matter because they set the stage for this 
&gt; cultural evolution.
&gt;  
&gt; With kind regards,
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;     Dear Pedro and list,
&gt;
&gt;     Once again Pedro, I am in general agreement with your observations.
&gt;
&gt;     However, what you ask here is not merely for a simple definition
&gt;     of information but the entire context in which such a notion can
&gt;     be founded.  Other definitions / notions are needed.  You must
&gt;     define what it is to &quot;know&quot; - what meaning and prediction are, for
&gt;     example. 
&gt;
&gt;     I have explored this question somewhat - so let me put it out
&gt;     there as a &quot;straw man.&quot;  This model takes my previous assertions
&gt;     regarding experience as its premise.
&gt;
&gt;     In my model all *metaphysics *is the embodied content of experience. 
&gt;
&gt;     *Meaning *is the embodied trace of experience - the physiological
&gt;     structure that characterizes a product of *semeiosis*.  Here is
&gt;     the cellular level requirement - as yet determined, but let us
&gt;     point to neuroplasticity as a possible example. Penrose might
&gt;     point to Orchestrated Objective Reduction as another possible
&gt;     example - whatever, it doesn't matter at this point except to
&gt;     observe that the model's architecture, when detailed, allows the
&gt;     prediction of the engineering of that physiological structure.
&gt;
&gt;     *Knowledge *is the determinant of action.  That is, it is revealed
&gt;     in action, in sentient entities it is the product of semeiosis
&gt;     over the embodied meaning set.  We know how to walk by our *innate
&gt;     *embodiment of meaning - the product of our genetics.  We know how
&gt;     to prove the Pythagoras theorem by *acquired *embodied meaning. 
&gt;     We know how to communicate by speech because we share a common
&gt;     acquired embodied *convention *(imperfectly).
&gt;
&gt;     Books, paintings, music are all *marks *- the subjects of signs. 
&gt;     *Signs *are the embodied experience of marks.  The sun rise, the
&gt;     wind blowing, flower in the field, are all marks.  Marks are
&gt;     either *natural marks* - the product of physical laws - or they
&gt;     are *metaphysical mark*s - the product of intent.  *Intent *is the
&gt;     meaning embodied by the creator of a metaphysical mark in its
&gt;     creation.
&gt;
&gt;     *Semeiosis *is the ongoing experience of signs - both those
&gt;     embodied as the traces of experience from past semeiosis and those
&gt;     that are the immediate product of senses.
&gt;
&gt;     So, finally, what is information?  *Information *is that which
&gt;     informs - by which we mean it identifies cause and adds to
&gt;     /knowledge /(see above definition). 
&gt;
&gt;     In my model I generalize the notion of knowledge so that I can
&gt;     apply the notion over inanimate/non-sentient cases - I know that
&gt;     this generalization makes people uncomfortable, as it does me on
&gt;     occasion,  but it is by this generalization that I can essentially
&gt;     define information simply as &quot;difference&quot; in all cases and I can
&gt;     argue that a particle &quot;knows&quot; what action to take as the product
&gt;     of information input.  This leads inevitably to my notion of
&gt;     &quot;perfect action&quot; ... but that will side track us here.
&gt;
&gt;     For completeness I should also mention my prediction model. 
&gt;     *Abduction *is the foundation of all prediction - it is the
&gt;     unfettered intuition.  *Induction *is the constraint of abduction
&gt;     by prior reductive experience - we learn induction by taking apart
&gt;     the world and putting it back together.  *Deduction *is the
&gt;     constraint of induction by formal conventions (such as
&gt;     mathematical logic) that we use in analysis and communication.
&gt;
&gt;     I hope this helps the discussion - I think I covered all Pedro's
&gt;     points.
&gt;
&gt;     With respect,
&gt;     Steven
