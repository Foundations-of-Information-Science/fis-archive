<p>
Dear Jerry and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful comments. Both Cristophe and Soeren had already 
<br />
made very relevant points, highlighted by your own comments, (and also very 
<br />
good points in the previous exchange between Rafael and Edwina, John H, 
<br />
Koichiro, Ted...). The discussions are very elegant and indeed one could 
<br />
write a book putting all this stuff together. Let me add just some parlance 
<br />
about the weaving metaphor.
<br />
<p>At 23.37 20/1/03 +0100, you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would only caution that the metaphor of weaving,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The info 'thread' needs to be woven into finer strands in order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provide those clear responses --and in spite of this conference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;advancements we keep the info thread largely into the state of 'bundle' yet.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was explored vigorously.  It is very picturesque and at times the metaphor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is compelling.  But, the practical utility of introducing the weaving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metaphor has not been demonstrated.  Also, is it possible that we already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have  the finest-grained structure for information in the Shannon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstraction and what we seek are coarser grained theories?
</em><br />
<p>It is in my language, yes I tend to abuse of picturesque metaphors, and 
<br />
quite often biased ones --I hope not too much in this case. (So I much like 
<br />
Jim's scarce postings, as he is a visual artist and uses a very pictorial 
<br />
language too--by the way, Jim, will you send the files on the buddisht 
<br />
sentence?)... Anyhow, as I was saying in a further paragraph of the last 
<br />
message: &quot; let me turn to the cellular discussion in order to emphasize 
<br />
that there are different 'infos': structural, generative, communicational. 
<br />
The gist would not reside in anyone alone, but in the whole new dynamics of 
<br />
'evanescent permanence' that together they are capable of implementing.&quot;
<br />
<p>This evanescent permanence, the genuine hallmark of information as I have 
<br />
speculated in some occasions, lends further support to the use of the 
<br />
'thread' metaphor. None of those three broad classes of cellular info can 
<br />
get the bioinformation dynamics by itself, but appropiately woven the three 
<br />
strands in a common thread, the strange dynamics emerges (my implicit 
<br />
emphasis is in the intriguing 'evanescence' part). Well, in a lively 
<br />
exchange with John H months ago, I remember his comments on the 
<br />
mythological riches of the thread metaphor: Ariadna, Penelope, Aphrodite... 
<br />
But there is an essay by philosopher Ortega y Gasset where this very 
<br />
metaphor gets all its philosophical splendor. It is about the 
<br />
interpretation by classical Roman writers (Pausanias, Plini) of a tomb's 
<br />
religious-decoration: apparently representing a domestic scene, where a man 
<br />
weaves a thread and a donkey eats it, with a woman around. However, writer 
<br />
Diodorus pointed to a different interpretation later on, meaning that it 
<br />
was related to reminiscences of the Egyptian cult to OKNOS, the Rope-Maker. 
<br />
To cut it briefly, Ortega  argues, with his usual brilliant style, that the 
<br />
whole power of nature is symbolized in this combination of the weaving and 
<br />
the unweaving, creation and destruction both put together, meaning the 
<br />
adaptive strength of that which is perpetually in the making (and in the 
<br />
dismantling), by keeping itself continuously IN-FORMATION as one can easily 
<br />
say reinterpreting the information spelling... The arcaic thought, free 
<br />
from the bondage of literacy mold, and the related 'atomism,' had it 
<br />
clearer about Nature generative processes than the classic writers, 
<br />
concludes Ortega addressing himself to the philosophy and the science of 
<br />
his time.
<br />
<p>Oknos, the rope-maker, and the donkey, and an intriguing feminine figure 
<br />
close by  (I have the picture here) could be a nice metaphor for the 
<br />
continuous coupling of protein synthesis-protein degradation, for synapsis 
<br />
creation and destruction in our brains, for entrepreneurial starting up and 
<br />
'creative destruction' in economic systems a la Schumpeter... Let me add 
<br />
that I was much intrigued by Karl's approach to partitions when I realized 
<br />
that it could provide new numerical counterparts to this dynamics of 
<br />
continuous adaptive exploration of breaking structures into parts, and the 
<br />
continuous synthesis of new parts, directly stemming out from a new number 
<br />
theory of minimalist design. Does the living play, along its creation &amp; 
<br />
destruction of structures and signals, by means of such partitional counting?
<br />
<p>I was willing to follow on further themes --time and language, and Rosen's 
<br />
'realization' problem, so close to the above reflection on info in cells, 
<br />
brains, firms-- but maybe is better stopping here. The new info theory 
<br />
(science) needs new abstractions, but also new guiding metaphors.
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Jerry, thanks for the acknowledgements.
