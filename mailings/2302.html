                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanic philosophy. Traditionally, one opposes &quot;grace&quot; against

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and only by assuming a harmonia praestabilita the reduction to physics
                        could
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;be warranted. The harmonia praestabilita &quot;fixes&quot; the next-order
                        system.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nowadays, we no longer oppose nature to grace, but to culture. Culture
                        adds
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;degrees of freedom. As Marx said, &quot;Die Natur baut keine
                        Maschinen.&quot; These
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;cultural solutions are also not fixed: the steam engines of Marx's time
                        are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;now to be seen in musea.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Asserting that culture adds degrees of freedom does not make it so,
                    <br />
                    though as I said in my previous post, it might give that appearance.
                    <br />
                    I prefer not to be seduced by appearances, and to ask what makes them
                    <br />
                    possible. There is a long history, as you say, and all of the
                    <br />
                    proposals so far to &quot;transcend the domain of physics&quot; have either not
                    <br />
                    been justified (including culture as a separate domain, as you now
                    <br />
                    suggest) or have proven false. So I think there is warrant for my
                    <br />
                    scepticism. My quest here is for some reason to think that culture
                    <br />
                    may not be reducible to basic physics, not a reassertion that it is
                    <br />
                    the case. Perhaps if I did not think that I have an explanation of
                    <br />
                    how it might work, then I would not be so persistent in asking for
                    <br />
                    reasons, and pointing out that the reasons you have given are very problematic.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An interesting question is how we can add dimensions to a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; model of a system that is justified by our knowledge of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; system. We do know that in standard physics, all
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possibilities are given by the phase space of the system.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is a matter of definition, so Loet is simply violating
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; technical terminology in the passage quoted above. If we add
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dimensions to a model without justification, it is very easy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to get the appearance of emergence without any reality to back it
                        up.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem is in the concept of &quot;reality&quot; which you use. This
                        reality of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics does not include the social system as an order of expectations

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;or--to say it with Leibniz and Husserl--as another monad. If this

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;justification is dismissed as a transgression of the physical reality,
                        then
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the transdisciplinary communication stops and we would live in &quot;two
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;cultures.&quot; From my perspective, however, your discourse can be
                        understood as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;one which contains a specific set of rationalized expectations about
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;reality&quot; or &quot;nature&quot; which can no longer understand
                        the models of that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality as parts of that reality. Insofar as a physicist manages to do
                        this,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;one has to assume that the models are already contained in this reality
                        from
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;an origin. This is precisely Leibniz's position: everything (the phase
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;space) was given by God at the moment of the Creation and revealed to us
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;because of His Grace. Our access is thus secured transcendentally.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Yes, that is my point about Fodor as well. He can't be right, but the question
                    <br />
                    is why is he not right. If we have a part of the world ontologically separate
                    <br />
                    from physics, then it seems that it is not relevant, since it cannot interact
                    <br />
                    with the physical, by the very hypothesis of its existence. I am asking
                    <br />
                    for ontological hygiene here, not for a physicalist world view. So your
                    <br />
                    presupposition that I am using a particular concept of &quot;reality&quot; is false.
                    <br />
                    I am asking how we reconcile the idea of new degrees of freedom with what
                    <br />
                    we know about physics without introducing problematic and mysterious
                    <br />
                    metaphysical entities. I take it that we accept the physical: we can kick
                    <br />
                    a stone and feel the resistance, observe the trajectory, and even calculate
                    <br />
                    and predict it reliably. This was not so of the folk physics that preceded
                    <br />
                    the Modern period. I want an intelligible reason to think that these &quot;extra
                    <br />
                    dimensions&quot; you invoke are not just a reflection of folk psychology and
                    <br />
                    sociology that is equally mythic. I don't think that is too much to ask
                    <br />
                    (especially since I think I have a pretty good sketch of an answer).
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If order is not given ex ante, but constructed ex post, reality becomes an
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;order of expectations. Physics then is the discourse which provides us
                        with
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;access on expectations concerning nature. One of the assumptions of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;specific discourse of physics is that the phase space is already given
                        (and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;revealed).
                    </em><br />
                <p>Reality is not an order of expectations. Reality is what enables the unexpected
                    <br />
                    and non-anticipatable. The phase space of physics does not have to be
                    <br />
                    revealed to create the problem I am addressing. Other than that, I probably
                    <br />
                    agree with you.
