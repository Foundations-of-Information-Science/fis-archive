<p>
Dear Jerry and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Some of the questions raised in your posting are really poignant.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am unaware of any specific process or logic that starts from mechanical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principles and generates chemical structures.  Quantum mechanics is based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the  notion that if one starts from a chemical structure, one can, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some cases, generate a mechanical view of the molecule.
</em><br />
<p>At the elementary level at which I can argue, 'physical chemistry' is the 
<br />
theoretical field --mostly developed by Linus Pauling-- that forged the 
<br />
link between quantum mechanics and theoretical chemistry. The central 
<br />
conceptualizations of that field revolve around symmetry and symm-breaking 
<br />
and are handled by means of group theory. A good summary on the successive 
<br />
abstractions which are necessary to get the molecular viewpoint from the 
<br />
principles of quantum mechanics can be found in Klaus Mainzer &quot;Concepts of 
<br />
Symmetry and the Unity of Science&quot; (Walter de Gruyer, 1991), starting from 
<br />
the Lorentz-invariant QM and the Galilei-invariant QM, following the 
<br />
Born-Openheimer procedure to achieve 'atoms', and the Hartree-Fock 
<br />
approximation to shared electron orbitals. The author discusses the whole 
<br />
series of theoretical steps (badly summarized here) as one of the greatest 
<br />
historical successes in theoretical reduction... And I think he is 
<br />
partially right! Looking for the blind spots of mechanical thinking --as I 
<br />
agree we should do, and I share some of your further points-- does not mean 
<br />
that we should look aside of their monumental achievements.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the concept of music is the same as the concept of a group, what is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generative role of an individual's CNS in creating the emotional response 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a particular song / piece / performance?  Or, what distinguishes two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual's response to the same music?
</em><br />
<p>I propose that we strongly distinguish between musical creation (in a 
<br />
written form) and specialized performance on the one side, versus the 
<br />
sensation and 'feeling' of music on the other. There is a very big 
<br />
asymmetry in between both aspects of the musical phenomenon: action / 
<br />
sensation. Deep formal training and a lot of practice are needed to achieve 
<br />
well-wrought structures in the former, while most of the sensation/feeling 
<br />
goes for 'free'. Clearly, numerous instances of the former may be properly 
<br />
represented by the group theory tools (some of the very groups above) and 
<br />
apart from Michael there is a number of musicological sudies about that 
<br />
--see for instance the ISIS  journal Symmetry, 1999, Vol 9, 1-2 (Arthur 
<br />
Loeb, Dalia Cohen, Irina Guletsky, etc.  For those interested in the 
<br />
biological origins of music, there is also theor. group studies on bird and 
<br />
whales songs. (eg, Dalia Cohen herself on birds).
<br />
<p>The sentience of music follows another path, apparently quite distant. As I 
<br />
have mentioned several times, the &quot;essentic forms&quot; of Manfred Clynes are 
<br />
one of the few extended hypothesis. It has defects, and an ugly commercial 
<br />
orientation (spurious I think) towards biomusical healing; but 
<br />
unfortunately I am ignorant about other interesting approaches. Besides, in 
<br />
my studies on laughter, in collaboration with Adrian Benitez from Mexico 
<br />
who is visiting here (and also JA Bea, both in this list), we are finding 
<br />
strong hints about the meaningfulness of these sentic forms in the 
<br />
different 'musical forms' of laughter. Interested parties may have a glance 
<br />
at a website that explores quite many (disconnected!) artistic aspects 
<br />
related to sentic forms: <a href="../../www.wavecrest.org.uk/wavecrest/Sentic%201a2.htm">http://www.wavecrest.org.uk/wavecrest/Sentic%201a2.htm</a>
<br />
Sentic forms are some sort of elementary curves, with a resemblance to 
<br />
natural landscapes of peaks and valleys (say, virtual landscapes putting 
<br />
together coupled distributions of neural excitation/inhibition). One of the 
<br />
possibilities we consider is the study of some of the sentic forms 
<br />
underlying laughter by means of Michael's 'process grammar' (could then the 
<br />
circle be closed, and  light be thrown onto the primary steps of musical 
<br />
sensory processing by 'groups' somehow mirroring the motor ones???)  Pure 
<br />
speculation, I admit.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It goes without saying that mechanical thinking is extraordinarily useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for solving mechanical problems. Our challenge, it seems to me, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distinguishing mechanical from non mechanical problems.  In earlier posts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I referred to this distinction as the difference between Shannon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information and human communication.  Speciation of relations?
</em><br />
<p>The reflection is very much in common. But I think that at the time being 
<br />
we cannot unwound or untie the Gordian knot at the thick place you suggest. 
<br />
We should attempt cutting it at a thinner place: the living cell. My 
<br />
opinion is that our common task of advancing a new &quot;informational 
<br />
explanatory framework&quot;, beyond the limitations of the mechanical, is a very 
<br />
complex, generational challenge. Actually it involves upturning and 
<br />
repositioning quite many conceptual stepping-stones, and not just targeting 
<br />
a new formalism (be it group theory, partitions, category theory, Boolean 
<br />
nets, non-euclidean counting, deterministic chaos, power laws, etc., all of 
<br />
them may be relevant to the info explanat. framework!). So the long-term 
<br />
importance of attracting interdisciplinary people to the list, and keeping 
<br />
patiently mixing our speculative ideas in very different fields...
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Recent movements in the list: Inputs of SCOTT (through John Collier) 
<br />
and ADRIAN (through myself). Unfortunately EDWINA left several weeks ago 
<br />
(she made no comments). We are around 90 people now.
