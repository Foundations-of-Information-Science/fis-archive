<p>
Dear discussants and FISers all,
<br />
<p>About John C's initial warning on entering the 'abduction garden' we have 
<br />
an idiom in Spanish ('meterse en un jardín') that means candidly placing 
<br />
oneself into a labyrinth. So, the caveat in Spanish sounded both prudent 
<br />
and humorous. Well, the notion of a labyrinth may capture our info problem 
<br />
rather than the passage in between Scila and Caribdis --and we can insert a 
<br />
few more interesting referents than just Shannon and McLuhan only, for 
<br />
instance those three classics, Adam Smith with the 'invissible hand' as a 
<br />
metaphor for info distributed causation, Cajal with his intriguing 
<br />
'principle of brain economy', and of course Darwin's towering 'fitness 
<br />
optimization', etc.
<br />
<p>I briefly return to the biological origins of the present abduction 
<br />
exchanges. We have a system, the cell, with a peculiar macro-meso-micro 
<br />
organizational texture. Let us liberally assume that we can characterize 
<br />
those three levels by the recent discussions here in our list: macro with 
<br />
James' purpose, meso with Cristophe constraints, micro with my fuzzy mol. 
<br />
recognition, and the ongoing communication dynamics with Jerry´s category 
<br />
model. Abduction (in my opinion) enters the picture to characterize how 
<br />
these organization levels interact so that the entity relates to its 
<br />
environment in an autonomously changing way, selectively, teleonomically. 
<br />
Well, that phenomenon or that capacity to select (depending on its 'needs' 
<br />
or goals) the boundary conditions with wich the system is going to 
<br />
informationally (and energetically) interact, is what could be called 
<br />
abduction. The biological agent abduces its environmental coupling... 
<br />
Anyhow, apart from writing the above while taking the customary pinch of 
<br />
salt, I invite Juan to retake his line on the interest to distinguish, from 
<br />
the physical perspective, the especial relationship of the living with its 
<br />
boundary conditions.
<br />
<p>About Edwina's comments on McLuhan, in natural science we rarely  place 
<br />
dismissive 'labels' on authors --semioticians included. We care whether 
<br />
they are interesting or not. And McLuhan (obviously without following in 
<br />
all the extremes) was a pioneer in quite many regards: multidisciplinary 
<br />
approach to info, evolutionary nature of social info, criticisms of 
<br />
specialism and of engineering views (Shannon), etc. Particularly, his 
<br />
'understanding media' is splendid. In the coming sessions --not perhaps 
<br />
right now, let us keep within this mostly bio discussions-- I will much 
<br />
welcome a reasoned discussion on the pros and cons of this author --not 
<br />
just whether he belonged to the Secondary, Triasic or Quaternary. 
<br />
Seriously, IMO, both the theoretical abscences and presences in his scheme 
<br />
are very important for our analysis of social info, which is another 
<br />
garden-labyrinth to visit in some of the next conference sessions.
<br />
<p>Finally, I would like to refer to the 'timing' dimension that is so 
<br />
apparent in the cellular and social usages of info. Related to that, in 
<br />
both domains, what I call the 'industry of novelty' tends to occupy more 
<br />
and more of the systemic activities... But am afraid that following that 
<br />
path would make this message too long.
<br />
<p>Best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
