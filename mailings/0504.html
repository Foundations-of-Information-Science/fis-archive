<p>
In reply to Soren Brier's post, where he writes that:
<br />
<p>&quot;I want to attract your attention to the fact that my paper attempt to
<br />
solve many of the problems you are discussion by suggesting: Five
<br />
levels of existence: 1 Quantum vacuum field. 2. Energy/matter. 3.
<br />
Information/signals or proto signs. 4. Signs/meaning. 5. Language.&quot;
<br />
<p>I haven't had time to read his paper but I like the sense of an
<br />
increasing complexity of organization. I'll have to read what a
<br />
'quantum vacuum field' is - but I agree with the basic concepts of the
<br />
quantum field as a process of energy dynamics. Energy then 'cools' to
<br />
become what we recognize as matter, differentiated into organized mass
<br />
(information)...which can operate as signals and then signs. Language
<br />
is, to me, a type of relation, a symbolic type of relation.
<br />
<p>Soren then writes: &quot;In this way you can follow Stonier in his
<br />
objective information concept and make it the organizing aspect of
<br />
nature as Taborsky also wants. Meaning is arising with the living
<br />
systems as fully triadic signs with meaning are first found with
<br />
living systems and language with symbols ( see Terrance Deacon: The
<br />
Symbolic Species) only in humans. Information is still a part of human
<br />
messages in language.&quot;
<br />
<p>Here - I would say that the triadic process is operative right down to
<br />
that basic quantum field theory. I disagree with the idea that
<br />
'meaning' begins only with living systems, though I fully agree that
<br />
only human language is symbolic.
<br />
<p>Soren's statement &quot; I suggest then the Peircian objective idealistic
<br />
pragmatic and evolutionary metaphysical framework that avoids both pan
<br />
informationism and pan semiotism. It is the only one I can see holding
<br />
this complexity although I know that many scientists think it is too
<br />
high a price to pay.&quot;
<br />
<p>Now- here, I disagree. Peirce is a pansemiotician or
<br />
pan-informationalist. He was, after all, a chemist, and a lot of his
<br />
writings deal with molecular interactions as semiotic. And as anyone
<br />
who knows me also knows - I'm a pansemiotician. I feel that semiosic
<br />
processes are basic - and found in the physico-chemical as well as the
<br />
biological and human realms. But- there's no point in trying to 'make'
<br />
everyone agree with this perspective. I think that one simply has to
<br />
state one's beliefs - and that's it.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what scientists are fearful of is quite valid- a
<br />
reductionism to what almost amounts to essentialism. However, stating
<br />
that processes of organization are operative at all levels is hardly a
<br />
reductionist essentialism. The key is to consider that each realm has
<br />
its limits. The physico-chemical realm cannot set up symbolic
<br />
relations! But it most certainly can operate within iconic and some
<br />
indexical relations. All such relations are triadic. There's an Object
<br />
to which one relates (another molecule). There's my long-term
<br />
normative rules of relation (the Representamen)..which I, as another
<br />
molecule , must follow in setting up how I relate to that Other
<br />
Molecule. And, there's my actual Interpretation, which is the result
<br />
of that relationship (I'm now bonded to that Other Molecule). So- it's
<br />
a triad, even though it's simple. The relation that I have with this
<br />
Other Molecule is equally simple - iconic or at most indexical. But
<br />
only a simple relation. The fact that I can't set up a secondary
<br />
referential system (symbolic) to talk about this interaction is not
<br />
relevant to the semiosis.
