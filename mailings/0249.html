Dear FIS researchers
<br />
<p>In the conference below FIS will meet with systems people, with second oprder cybernetics (ASC) and with semiotics of nature and ethics plus many others. It is a unique event to have so many perspective on FIS, systems, cybernetics and semiotics and to ha
<br />
ve Bela Banathy from FIS to orchestra the meeting. Please join and make this a major historical event. We want as many different paradigms as possible represented.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special FIS issue of Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing is going to be published in February.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><p><p>&nbsp;ANNOUNCEMENT OF ANNUAL MEETING
<br />
AND GENERAL CALL FOR PAPERSTHE FORTY-THIRD MEETING OFTHE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SYSTEMS SCIENCES
<br />
<p>June 27-July 2, 1999
<br />
Asilomar Conference Center on the Monterey Peninsula
<br />
Pacific Grove, California, USA
<br />
<p>HUMANITY, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY:
<br />
THE SYSTEMIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE INFORMATION AGE
<br />
<p>During the past few centuries we have achieved a remarkable synthesis of science and technology.  We have been less successful in establishing a graceful or even workable relationship between nature, humanity, science, and technology.  It is becoming incr
<br />
easingly important for us to ask the fundamental questions that will lead to an understanding of these relationships.
<br />
<p>Unique to our age is the massive scale at which we are applying science and technology to the construction of our physical, social, and cultural reality.  However, our approach to the construction of these realities is fragmented.  A distinguishing featur
<br />
e of the next millennium must be a more systemic view of science and technology.  A view that gives full expression to the creative energy of the human spirit upon which the information age can be built. 
<br />
<p>A disciplined approach to engaging our creative energy calls for a level of understanding that crosses the boundaries between the humanities, the arts, the sciences, and technologies.  It certainly calls for a re-examination of science, one that embraces 
<br />
different ways of knowing, and different ways of being.  The boundary-crossings may well be rooted in our humanity, in our conceptions of aesthetics, justice, morality, and ethics.
<br />
<p>The above discussion echoes the sentiments of the founders of ISSS.  Some 44 years ago a group of systems thinkers asked: How can science be unified?  How can science be applied to the improvement of the human condition?   Since the time when these questi
<br />
ons were asked, humanity has achieved a remarkable synthesis of science and technology.  Some fragmentation has been overcome; however, significant, and deep-rooted fragmentation remains.  It may well be that in order for us to take the next step, the ori
<br />
ginal questions should be rephrased to read:  How can the improvement of the human condition become the basis for the unification of science?  How can the unification of science become the basis for the improvement of the human condition?  
<br />
<p>This Annual Meeting is being organized in collaboration with: the American Society for Cybernetics,  Andean Institute of Systems, General Evolutionary Research Group, Institute for The Study of Complex Systems, International Systems Institute, and the res
<br />
earch group on the Foundations of Information Science.
<br />
<p><p>ORGANIZATION OF MEETING
<br />
<p>The Annual Meeting will be organized around plenary sessions, symposia, paper sessions, workshops, discussion groups, and poster sessions.  In addition, some sessions will encourage pre-meeting discussion of topics in a virtual conferencing format on the 
<br />
internet.
<br />
<p>The abstracts of papers selected for presentation will be posted on the ISSS web-site prior to the meeting, in order to encourage participants to become familiar with the content of presentations before arrival.  Such postings should encourage collaborati
<br />
on among authors, and integration across sessions.

<br />
<p><p>Foundations of Information Science
<br />
<p>An Exploratory Session on the Question:
<br />
Is there a way beyond the conflict between the mechanistic-logical and the phenomenological-semiotic view of science and cognition?
<br />
The classical approach to science looks for universal laws and logical structures uniting physicochemical nature, the living, cognition, intelligence, and society. But it has created a big divide around the problem of semantics and signification in bio-so
<br />
cio-cultural systems. On the one side, phenomenological and linguistic views have tended to ignore the biological nature of the observer and communicator, seeing the problem of meaning only as socially and individually constructed. While on the other side
<br />
, the classical approach to information science, derived frominformation theory and the computer sciences, has seen the problem of meaning under the light of &quot;representation&quot; and &quot;syntax&quot;, implying a questionable extension of the mechanistic world view in
<br />
to the socio-cultural realm.Is there a possible non-reductionist unification of the two views from some kind of new Foundations of Information Science? Or do we have to live with the full-blown version of both information para!
<br />
digms in a sort of complementarity philosophy (N. Bohr)?   Indeed the present &quot;information age&quot; represents a powerful stimulus to attempt the synthesis of a unified information discipline. A historical parallel with the emergence of thermodynamics after t
<br />
he onset of the industrial revolution may be in order.  Will the concept of information change our worldview as the concept of energy did?   Send Abstracts and Papers to:S=F8ren Brier, Ph.D., Session Chair, Landboh¿jskolen Inst. for Oekonomi, Skov og Land

<p><p><p>Submission of Material for the 1999 ISSS Conference
<br />
<p>Abstract
<br />
<p>The abstract should give an overview of your main theses, methods by which you plan to support your ideas and, if appropriate, a description of the case studies you plan to present.  
<br />
<p>Abstracts can be a full page in length, figures may be included, but do not go over the one page limit.  Use the paper style guidelines for abstract style.  Abstracts do not need to be submitted on disc.  We do however need a clean, hard copy to work from
<br />
.  The preferred procedure is to send a hard copy and an e-mail copy to the SIG Chair and also to Bela  Banathy.  Faxed abstracts will be accepted only under special circumstances.  Abstracts should be submitted immediately.
<br />
<p>The abstracts will be reviewed and the acceptance of papers will be based on the reviews.  Even if an abstract has been accepted, if a full paper is not received by the paper submission deadline, the abstract will not be included in the abstract book and 
<br />
we will assume that the author is not planning to present his/her work at the conference.  
<br />
<p>The abstracts will be printed while the proceedings will be available on CD-ROM.  An author may choose to submit a revised abstract along with the full paper.  Then the revised abstract will be used in the creation of the book of abstracts.
<br />
<p>Submission of Papers
<br />
<p>Papers are to be submitted in the specified computer format on disc.  If this is difficult, we will try to arrange either to have your paper scanned or typed at an additional charge to you.  Please let us know as soon as possible if this will be necessary
<br />
.  Please follow the paper style guidelines.
<br />
<p>If your paper is intended for a specific SIG, please submit it both to Bela Banathy and the appropriate SIG chair.  Bela Banathy must receive both hard and soft copies of your paper by April 15, 1999.  The SIG chair may only require a hard copy.
<br />
<p>Paper Editing
<br />
<p>After submission, papers may be edited.  Jennifer Wilby and Martin Hall will be the general editors, but they will co-opt experts in different areas for assistance.  We will attempt to forward your paper to you after editing for your approval, but that ma
<br />
y not always be possible. 
<br />
<p>The Vickers Award
<br />
<p>A plaque and check for $500 will be awarded for the best student paper.  Although the advisor may be a co-author on the paper, it is understood that this award is meant to recognize student accomplishment and the paper should reflect principally the work 
<br />
of the student.  Please indicate at the time of paper submission if your paper is to be considered for the Vicker*s award and certify that this work was performed while you were a student.  (You may have since received your degree.)
<br />
<p>Submission
<br />
<p>Submit abstracts immediately, papers by April 15, 1999 to both SIG Chair and Bela  Banathy
<br />
