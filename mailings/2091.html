                <p>John,
                    <br />
                <p>Thanks for bringing this into the conversation. There is another
                    <br />
                    relevant body of literature written largely by behavioral scientists
                    <br />
                    based on individual performances in experimental economic games. For
                    <br />
                    example, one well-studied game (I forget the name of the game)
                    <br />
                    establishes two classes of subjects: givers and receivers. Each
                    <br />
                    giver starts with a meaningful sum of money on paper and is paired
                    <br />
                    with a receiver, and each is anonymous to the other. The giver must
                    <br />
                    decide how much of the sum to offer to the receiver, and the receiver
                    <br />
                    either accepts or rejects the offer. If the offer is rejected,
                    <br />
                    neither individual gets any money. If it is accepted, then each
                    <br />
                    receives the agreed upon amounts. When this game was played with
                    <br />
                    individuals from primitive cultures the total amount at stake was
                    <br />
                    equivalent to something like 1/3 of an annual income. This
                    <br />
                    experiment has been repeated many times and in a variety of social
                    <br />
                    contexts. The results have always been largely inconsistent with the
                    <br />
                    basic assumption of standard Keynesian economics, which states that
                    <br />
                    individuals act so as to maximize their profits. It seems that
                    <br />
                    cultural norms are much more important drivers of individual economic
                    <br />
                    behavior, and that these norms are free to evolve far from the
                    <br />
                    Keynesian criterion. I see these results as providing strong support
                    <br />
                    for the notion that economic behavior evolves as an aspect of
                    <br />
                    cultural self-organization. For those who are not familiar with this
                    <br />
                    literature I can suggest a couple of references.
