Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>We now enter the next stage. Following Peter's lead, I will pose three 
<br />
questions prompted by the papers for this stage. The papers are:
<br />
<p>R. Lahoz-Beltra and Vieri Di Paola, Towards a computational view of cell: 
<br />
do cells bear a resemblance with computers?
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler, Organic Communication I. Conceptual Background
<br />
<p>Christophe Menant, Information and Meaning
<br />
<p>As we have seen from the discussion so far, there is not a lot of agreement 
<br />
on the meaning of 'information'. However, we have been able to communicate 
<br />
fairly well, despite diverse views on the matter. This suggests that the 
<br />
definition of 'information' is far less important than the enthusiasm about 
<br />
the correct definition of the term might lead one to believe.
<br />
Two uses of the idea of information that arose (&quot;emerged&quot; is far too 
<br />
strong) primarily in the latter half of the 20th Century are that of 
<br />
&quot;information processing&quot; and &quot;communication theory&quot;. Both deal solely with 
<br />
syntactic or formal aspects of information, but have had a powerful impact 
<br />
on our conceptions of information in general. These applications of the 
<br />
idea of information are essentially technological, notwithstanding their 
<br />
highly formal nature, and were developed primarily by engineers, or those 
<br />
working in an engineering environment.
<br />
<p>This history raises two very general questions: 1) How much can technical 
<br />
applications tell us about information &quot;in the wild&quot;?, and 2) How far can 
<br />
we go with formal and mechanical models of the properties of information?
<br />
<p>All three of these papers deal, at least implicitly, with these two 
<br />
questions. For focus, I suggest the following questions concerning each 
<br />
paper. These are just suggestions, and should not be thought of as intended 
<br />
to limit discussion.
<br />
<p>R. Lahoz-Beltra and Vieri Di Paola say:
<br />
<p>================================================
<br />
2.      The 'hardware + software' dualism leads to a misleading conception 
<br />
of cell. In cells 'biomolecule + function' are inseparable elements in 
<br />
contrast with computers. For instance, it is possible to have a computer 
<br />
without operating system and software. Of course, it is not useful but in 
<br />
cells it is impossible to have biomolecules without biological function.
<br />
================================================
<br />
<p>Q4. How important is this difference, and does it have any bearing on the 
<br />
issue of whether a formal system can have a semantics that is not implied 
<br />
externally?
<br />
<p><p>Jerry LR Chandler says:
<br />
<p>================================================
<br />
A central hypothesis is that correspondence relations between algebraic 
<br />
species and organic species generate a robust basis for message specificity 
<br />
and sensitivity.  I presuppose that category theory is a suitable 
<br />
mathematical framework for a general theory of communication.
<br />
================================================
<br />
<p>Q5. Must this correspondence be such that organic species resemble 
<br />
computational &quot;agents&quot; as used in Alife programs, in which communication is 
<br />
fully formalized in terms of explicit rules (&quot;methods&quot;)?
<br />
<p><p>Christophe Menant says:
<br />
<p>================================================
<br />
A meaning is an information representing the connection between an incident 
<br />
information and the constraint of the system.
<br />
<p>More completely:
<br />
&quot;A meaning is a meaningful information that is created by a system 
<br />
submitted to a constraint when it receives an external information that has 
<br />
a connection with the constraint. The meaning is formed of the connection 
<br />
existing between the incident information and the constraint of the system. 
<br />
The function of the meaningful information is to participate to the 
<br />
determination of an action that will be implemented in order to satisfy the 
<br />
constraint of the system&quot;.
<br />
================================================
<br />
<p>Q6. Is this characterization of meaning formalizable, and in particular is 
<br />
the notion of the constraint of the system formalizable?
<br />
<p><p>Obviously, I have assumed that people have read the relevant abstracts. Do it!
<br />
<p><p>I'll be in Yalta until July 9th, trying to help organize self-organization. 
<br />
Please try to avoid requiring moderation until then :-), but do post your 
<br />
thoughts.
<br />
<p><p>John
