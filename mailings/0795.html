<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and valleys have to change (eg, prokaryots vs. eukaryots; plants vs.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;less follow him in this overall approach to biological (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technological!) exploration of optimality when the environment presents 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conflicting demands... Besides, evidences of optimality in biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;STRUCTURES, very well studied ones, pile up in the classical literature 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(eg, D'Arcy Thompson): skeletons, bones, shells, internal organs, brains, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neuronal connections, plants, leaves, flowers, widespread Fibonacci series 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and golden mean ratios in morphologies, etc. In the late 80's, quite many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;studies of MOLECULAR optimality were done (eg, glycogen molecular design, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pentose cycle, Kelvin cycle, metabolic control, etc.), and quite many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mutational analysis were performed --with the result that most natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enzymes are just 'optimal' to their molecular function... FUNCTIONALLY or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physiologically (pretty more difficult terrain) there also lots of studies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and controversies on allometric relationships, grounded on optimal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;efficiency when metabolism, transportation, maintenance, degradation, etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are considered together.  The prevalence of the 3/4 power law relations in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most animal species is understood as a hallmark of the systemic quest for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;optimal efficiency.
</em><br />
<p>Although I would agree that there are cases in which optimality IS 
<br />
relatively well-defined, I doubt that fitness landscapes can give us 
<br />
optimality criteria in general. The main problem is that fitness is a 
<br />
relation between an organism or population of organisms and environment. If 
<br />
the parameters of the two are independent (as required by the autopoiesis 
<br />
account of autonomy or the closure view of efficient causation inn 
<br />
organisms), then there is no problem, but if the two are dynamically linked 
<br />
such that function depends on both (as I suggested), then changes in the 
<br />
organism can change the fitness landscape (and vice versa, of course) so 
<br />
that non-linear relations between the two can affect fitness measures. 
<br />
Effectively, this means that moves towards optimality can change the 
<br />
landscape, which becomes a moving target. This is just the interaction case 
<br />
that Jerry invokes, quite correctly and insightfully, in my opinion. This 
<br />
objection would also apply to optimality explanations of enzymes -- the 
<br />
question still arises, why this molecule rather than that one -- the 
<br />
optimality space is not obviously well defined for sets of alternative 
<br />
molecules, even if the molecular shape space is dependent only on the 
<br />
molecule. If their is some global criterion (global extremal principle), 
<br />
optimization within this constraint is possible. But, as I said, there are 
<br />
reasons to think that at least two proposed extremal principles related to 
<br />
ordering and organization are not generally true. This isn't to say that 
<br />
there are not others. 3/4 power law relations might be an alternative. I 
<br />
have looked at these only superficially. I doubt that they are general 
<br />
enough, from what I have seen so far, and there has been some criticism of 
<br />
the data fit to the power law. The explanation in terms of branching 
<br />
distribution and collection patterns is intriguing (the 4 space network 
<br />
filling the 3 space volume), but it seems to me that we really should have 
<br />
1 space transport systems filling a three space volume, and we should get a 
<br />
3-x/3 law. Some critics have said that laws of this form are consistent 
<br />
with the evidence. Anyway, I remain sceptical.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for John, I appreciate the very elegant synthesis presented about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different approaches (mostly non-biological ones) to extremal principles. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am particularly intrigued by the MaxEntPro. The only additional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suggestion I would make about that principle is, What would happen if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enzymes had efficiently decoupled their 'informational' work from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thermodynamic entropy (&amp; free energy) requirements?
</em><br />
<p>I haven't thought about this much for enzymes, about which my knowledge is 
<br />
embarrassingly small. Some people (e.g., Stan Salthe) have tried to apply 
<br />
MaxEntPro to informational space when information and energy are largely 
<br />
decoupled. I would suppose that the same considerations abut extremes would 
<br />
apply to the informational space (we should expect neither maximal 
<br />
information preservation nor maximal information dissipation). I have 
<br />
argued various cases with Stan for some time, but though our positions have 
<br />
hardened, I don't think either of us has a knockdown argument. In any case, 
<br />
for enzymes, assuming decoupling, MaxEntPro would imply maximal elimination 
<br />
of alternatives. Stan, in recent discussion with me, justifies this with 
<br />
selection from competition for energy gradients, but it could also arise 
<br />
from competition for information (I take it that this was his earlier view, 
<br />
which he has not rejected, but he tends now, as he has at times in the 
<br />
past, to assimilate information and energy considerations). For my part, I 
<br />
doubt that competition for resources is decisive, mostly because I think 
<br />
that the notion of resource is a moving target. I am not clear how to 
<br />
specify this for the case of enzymes. I just don't know enough. If it 
<br />
turned out that enzyme competition is strong compared to rates of change in 
<br />
the values (resources) for which there is competition, Stan might be right 
<br />
for the enzyme case. There may be a range of cases, or typical cases may be 
<br />
irreducibly complex, and non-optimizable.
<br />
<p>I think it is an interesting question, which I intend to keep in mind.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
John
