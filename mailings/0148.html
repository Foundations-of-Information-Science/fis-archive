<p>
This is my first posting to the fis list, I think, so let me introduce myself.
<br />
<p>I am working in the area of information infrastructure to support
<br />
collaboration of many people and organizations to conduct very complex
<br />
projects. We have a real problem in how we model the behavior in these
<br />
systems and the information which supports them. For reasons not of
<br />
interest here, probablistic and modal systems are inadequate, and we likely
<br />
cannot do as well here as we want unless there is a major breakthrough in
<br />
information science for this domain.
<br />
<p>I have only been thinking about these issues in an fis way since Vienna, so
<br />
please forgive the incompleteness of these thoughts.
<br />
<p>First, I understand &quot;information&quot; to mean two different things:
<br />
<p>---information(1) is the way of representing the dynamics of systems so
<br />
that we can understand them. As such, the abstractions provide basis for
<br />
science, the purpose of which is to understand and predict.
<br />
<p>---information(2) is the way of explaining the organizational pull on systems.
<br />
<p>A main theme of fis as I understand it, is to examine info(2) to shed light
<br />
on info(1) rather than the traditional mode of the other way around.
<br />
Info(1) requires an observer whereas info(2) does not. The appeal of
<br />
info(2) is that one can also exclude the clockmaker from the equation as
<br />
well as the clockwatcher and look purely at how the clock organized itself.
<br />
In the Biosystems issue, I  noted two ideas that follow from this fis
<br />
perspective that may be useful.
<br />
<p>Idea 1: Vertical Information Flow
<br />
<p>The world's information flows are layered. The dynamics of what organizes
<br />
systems at the atomic level are somehow fundamentally different from those
<br />
at, say, the cellular level, and again different from the social level.
<br />
(Forget for a moment how many layers there are and whether the division is
<br />
canonical.) In other words, the abstraction space of physics information is
<br />
different than that of biomechanics. The latter can, of course, be at least
<br />
partially &quot;explained&quot; by particle physics, but some new abstractions are
<br />
introduced at the &quot;higher&quot; level, and all abstractions from the lower level
<br />
must be remapped.
<br />
<p>Yet, it is clear that from an info(2) perspective, some of the
<br />
organizational rules of partical physics are at play in how biological
<br />
systems organize. The information flow through this &quot;vertical&quot; layer (form
<br />
physics to biology) is interesting. We not only have an information dynamic
<br />
which organizes quarks into atoms and molecules and thence into galaxies
<br />
(so-called &quot;horizontal&quot; information flow), we also have a (presumably
<br />
information-motivated) organizational principle that (perhaps creates and)
<br />
spans these vertical layers.
<br />
<p>Most fis-ers work purely within one layer and then look for analogies that
<br />
can be mapped from one horizontal to another. But I think this vertical
<br />
flow is much more basic. Conrad particularly impresses me because he is
<br />
empirically working at one of these boundaries.
<br />
<p>This notion is important when it comes to the social layer. I believe that
<br />
we can only go so far in looking at the horizontal mechanics of biosystems
<br />
for insights and analogies to inform the (horizontal mechanics of the)
<br />
social/cultural layer. Instead, the jumping of the vertical abstraction
<br />
layers seems more fundamental, more rewarding to examine.
<br />
<p>(Incidentally, I believe symmetry primitives may provide an abstraction
<br />
vocabulary which can carry information through the different conceptual
<br />
spaces of the various layers. But that is another message
<br />
)
<br />
<p>Here is the payoff. At the boundary below the social/cultural layer,
<br />
info(1) and info(2) become more congruent, because the &quot;users&quot; are the
<br />
actors as well. In Vienna, I proposed that this boundary is the most
<br />
rewarding for fis attention because of both:
<br />
<p>---the potential for a breakthough by using the ideas of linguistics and
<br />
messaging (distinctly info(1) concepts) since these only have meaning with
<br />
a reflective observer. Matsuno impresses me as having done some good
<br />
thinking here. As well, I personally have found liguistic-related ideas to
<br />
be the most leverageable (situation and category theories).
<br />
<p>---the idea of what this is all about. We want (new insights for) a
<br />
_science_. That's an info(1) idea. It requires an observer and a platform
<br />
above the vertical boundary below the human/cultural) level.
<br />
<p>Moreover, that layer is much more in obvious need of new science, than say
<br />
partical physics. This need, and the costs of not having a useful science,
<br />
means that the work may be not only more immediately useful and accepted,
<br />
but more readily funded.
<br />
<p>Bottom line of this idea:
<br />
<p>---vertical flow is more promising than the already visible fis preference
<br />
for horizontal dynamics;
<br />
<p>---for a variety of reasons, the social/cultural layer (and relations to
<br />
lower levels) is the most promising area for focus;
<br />
<p>---the distinction between info(1) and (2) is important, and probably
<br />
leverageable in bringing in mathematical principles of language and
<br />
information as tools for exploration
<br />
<p>Idea 2: An Extropic Motivator
<br />
<p>Within both horizontal and vertical flow, we presume that there are
<br />
information-based organizing principles at work. Conventional science
<br />
posits two concept spaces for this: the space of the &quot;creator&quot; from whence
<br />
the laws at work come (which are immutable) and the space of the phenomena
<br />
which (must) follow these laws. The differentiation of concept spaces for
<br />
clockworks from clockmaker is the same as between info(1) and (2). Focusing
<br />
on (2) allows us to be freed the clockmaker, and the vexing idea of entropy
<br />
that follows. (Entropy is a specifically (2) concept.)
<br />
<p>An info(2) view allows us to posit an anti-entropic (or extropic)
<br />
mechanics. Here, &quot;lost information&quot; instead of being lost, adds to the form
<br />
and strength of the law at work. The clock creates itself and the laws
<br />
under which it operates by being and operating as a clock.
<br />
<p>There's more on this idea. But for now, let's just look at implications for
<br />
the social/cultural level. I suppose that the situation is not a simple
<br />
layer cake with fundamental particles at the bottom and societies at the
<br />
top. Instead, this is a circular collection. The top/bottom layer is what
<br />
we've filled with the blunt concept of God.
<br />
<p>The leverage here is that we now have a layer above the social/cultural
<br />
layer and an outline for an info(3) which are the extropic principles. It
<br />
is the analogy of the observer status except the observer is the universe.
<br />
<p>Bottom line of this idea:
<br />
<p>---information is not only the principle around which systems organize
<br />
within laws, but is also the principle around which the universe organizes
<br />
those laws;
<br />
<p>---once again, examination of the social/cultural layer is the high payoff
<br />
area here, this time on the boundary above;
<br />
<p>---also again, the nature of abstraction itself is the key idea which could
<br />
inform us. But it has to be a recursive concept, since the laws of
<br />
abstraction are part of the laws which self-create. The discussions on
<br />
cosciousness bear on this.
<br />
<p>Comments (I've been periodically dipping into the discussion; please
<br />
forgive me for whatever misunderstandings this imperfect student has):
<br />
<p>Artigiani: in his first sentences of the kickoff message, he defines the
<br />
info(1) and (2) problem. However, for my purposes, VEMs are not sufficient;
<br />
they are not abstract principles which can inform a new science, unless he
<br />
has something interesting under the thumbnail of &quot;values.&quot; I see this as a
<br />
slightly better articulation of the higher level than &quot;God.&quot; He does,
<br />
however, introduce persistence of information outside the layer, which I
<br />
think is a vertical process.
<br />
<p>Marijuan: I do not understand infopoieis. But I do understand his
<br />
suggestion that mechanics of division are more fundamental than those of
<br />
unification, and that laws of death (autonecrosis) may be more rewarding to
<br />
examine than laws of creation (on which we seem to be stuck). The
<br />
partitional calculus seems intriguing and I'd like to hear more about the
<br />
language principles invoked.
<br />
<p>Stonier: frustrates me because he seems to stick to one layer and be
<br />
concerned with horizontal dynamics. However, the idea of examining
<br />
granulatity seems rewarding, since that is likely related to verticality.
<br />
Interestingly, his term &quot;infon&quot; (at least for my use) is identical to the
<br />
same term invented by Barwise and Perry in 1981. But infons do not capture
<br />
a notion of state. That is why in Vienna, we introduced the notion of
<br />
&quot;acton&quot; which is at once more fundamental and includes a state delimiter.
<br />
But I've already noted these are not objective. In fact, they could serve
<br />
as the basis for non-realism.
<br />
<p>Matsuno: as noted, seems to have done some careful thinking about language
<br />
primitives and &quot;grammatology.&quot; His notions of tense mirror our info/acton
<br />
conversion, and in particular can be seen as a basis of causality.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
