In reply to Soren:
<br />
<p>My comment to the first paragraph below, with the phrase &quot;interpreting
<br />
things that are not intended to be a sign&quot; is that this is a
<br />
semiological and not a semiotic perspective, understanding
<br />
semiological to refer to language based or symbolic interaction. A
<br />
sign, to me, using the Peircean framework can refer to its object
<br />
iconically, indexically or symbolically. It is only in the latter
<br />
case, the 'symbolic' style of object-reference, that  anthropomorhpic
<br />
intentionality is inserted. But, as Soren points out, for Peirce,
<br />
intentionality is basic to all levels of semiosis.
<br />
<p>As for classical logic being without meaning, that refers only to the
<br />
Form of its infrastructure. However, since I am not a Platonist -
<br />
where Form is operative separated from context (ie, pure form or
<br />
design separated from matter)....then, I feel that such a state simply
<br />
cannot exist. A pure abstract Form, in Peircean terms would be a
<br />
rhemetic iconic legisign, which is an abstract diagramme. BUT, no
<br />
abstract diagramme exists as such, floating in the air, in all its
<br />
pure design. The action of abstracting that diagramme from the
<br />
particular realities in which that design actually exists, is a
<br />
process carried out by Mind. The abstract diagramme - as abstract and
<br />
general - is without context (ie, without meaning). BUT, it cannot
<br />
exist as such a universal in reality, for universals do not exist
<br />
separately from context (unless, again, you are a Platonist). They
<br />
only exist (and universals ARE real) as contextualized within
<br />
particulars (Aristotle).
<br />
<p>Finally, I don't think that Peirce sees logic as evolving from
<br />
signification, which suggests that the latter is prior to the former.
<br />
They are co-evolving. Signification or semiosis is a logical process.
<br />
There's no such thing as signification (semiosis?) separate from
<br />
logic.
<br />
<p>Dear John and Edwina
<br />
<p>&quot;Sign games&quot; is my term for what animals have ,seen in relation to the
<br />
human &quot;language games&quot;. It is the life context for communication
<br />
processes. You could say that every interpretation is  signification,
<br />
but as far as I can se Winfried Nöth uses it spe
<br />
cifically for the process in - what he calls ecosemiotics -
<br />
interpreting things that are not intended to be a sign to stand for
<br />
something anyway. This is the crucial difference between Peirce and
<br />
Saussure's theories of signs, that Peirce accept non-inte
<br />
nti
<br />
onal signs.
<br />
<p>I think that classical logic in itself is supposed to be meaningless.
<br />
content and meaning comes from what you apply it to. But Edwina is
<br />
right that Peirce sees logic as evolving from signification and
<br />
therefore always be in a meaningful context. I also t
<br />
hink that it is a great advantage in his theory.

In reply to John Holgate
<br />
<p>It's minor, but the usual term is 'semiotician' rather than
<br />
'semiotist' (as used by JH)...but..who can say that it won't change.
<br />
<p>However - I'm unclear why 'signification' is set up as a synonym for
<br />
'sign games'. Indeed, I have no idea what a sign game is.
<br />
<p>(1)Then, John states that IF &quot;so then signification (sign games) and
<br />
the abductive method rather than classical syllogistic (or Florido's
<br />
alethic) logic is our starting point. Alternatively , if 'information
<br />
science' is to be based on a theory of 'meaning' that's a whole new
<br />
ball game&quot;.
<br />
<p>And also:
<br />
(2) Since Peirce redefined 'induction' away from the classical sense
<br />
towards
<br />
a heuristic principle of signification it may be fruitful to explore
<br />
his six modes of abduction
<br />
(hunch/symptom/metaphor/clue/diagnosis/explanation). If we could make
<br />
a connection between
<br />
'abduction' in the biomedical domain and 'abductive triggers'
<br />
(surprise/novelty/anomaly) in phenomenology it could have considerable
<br />
explanatory power for a unifying theory.
<br />
<p>And also:
<br />
(3)If we separate meaning from classical logic (exemplified in
<br />
Florido's concept of semantic information) as has occurred more or
<br />
less in postKantian phenomenology (Heidegger, Derrida, Peirce etc) we
<br />
are left with the admittedly vague function of abductive inference and
<br />
context-bound interest . Does it yield 'too little knowledge' for a
<br />
working methodology which would satisfy all 'four corners'of your
<br />
model?
<br />
<p><p>Let me comment, point by point.
<br />
<p>(1) I'm not sure what signification=sign games means, so it's rather
<br />
difficult to comment on this. The signifying action is a process, made
<br />
up of at least three basic Relations. These  relations establish
<br />
measurements, or 'organized links' within certain codes
<br />
(organizational patterns) of a mass of energy to another mass of
<br />
energy. By virtue of these relations, the mass is contextualized,
<br />
organized, 'held', so to speak in an existential reality in time and
<br />
space. THIS IS A LOGICAL PROCESS. The measurements or encoded actions
<br />
of organization must operate within a logic, a formal process. The
<br />
three relations are, in themselves, a logical process.
<br />
Indeed, the very basis of Peircean semiosis - is logic. Logic, to
<br />
Peirce, is another term for semiotics.
<br />
<p>(2) Again, I'm not sure what you mean by defining induction away from
<br />
the classical sense to a 'heuristic principle of signification'.  The
<br />
notion of induction as a means of establishing statistical probability
<br />
rather than necessary conclusions is 'classical'...and is Peircean.
<br />
Abduction is one of the three classical (Aristotelian and Peircean)
<br />
methods of 'finding knowledge', and is, as Soren points out, premissed
<br />
on the notion of chance and freedom. What's so special about abduction
<br />
in the biomedical domain?
<br />
<p>(3) I think that it would help if you defined your understanding of
<br />
'meaning'. I don't see that meaning has ever separated itself from
<br />
logic  A logic without meaning is illogical. How can you put Peirce
<br />
side by side with the phenomenologists such as Heidegger and (yuck)
<br />
Derrida?? The point of the Peircean semiotics/logic, is that it
<br />
enabled a meaningful world - and that is valid within all processes
<br />
whether physico-chemical, biological or socioconceptual. Recall that
<br />
the Peircean semiotic triad, its syllogism, has a major premiss,  -
<br />
that is, a cohesive ground of continuity. That prevents the
<br />
interpretant (meaning) from being ONLY defined within current-time
<br />
contexts and insists that the interpretant's reality (its meaning)
<br />
exists within links to a cohesive history of interactions, and to a
<br />
set of links to very wide contexts - not just the immediate local
<br />
context.
