                    The polarisation between &quot;subjective&quot; processes within the brain and
                    <br />
                    &quot;objective&quot; processes within the brain is but a social etiquette. The
                    <br />
                    sentences &quot;I feel hungry&quot; and &quot;I know that 2+2=4&quot; (or simply &quot;2+2=4&quot;)
                    have
                    <br />
                    but a social reliability implication difference (in case A we cannot share
                    <br />
                    this feeling and it is temporary, in case B we /believe to/ know that we can
                    <br />
                    share this feeling and we /believe to/ know that it aeternal and ubiquitous.
                    <br />
                    /Isn't it funny that since the Emlightement, as we dissolved God, we appear
                    <br />
                    to believe in God-like properties of all-pervasiveness, neutrality,
                    <br />
                    rationality, all-validity, temporal and spatial omnipotence of the so-called
                    <br />
                    objective fact?/).
                    <br />
                    This polarisation has brought up many a variety of tortured strenuous
                    <br />
                    approaches to consolidate and polarise, according to the (economic)
                    <br />
                    requirements of the philosophers. The mind/body antagonism, the atavistic
                    <br />
                    instincts vs. civilised progress /with the burden of white men e.g. to
                    <br />
                    spread democracy/, the noble savage called Emile and the alienated urban
                    <br />
                    slave; the healthy, natural instincts vs. one-dimensional, seducted,
                    <br />
                    brain-heavy participant in the rat race are some of the most usual clichees,
                    <br />
                    and to each one there has already been produced a mirror-symmetrical
                    <br />
                    rhetorical opposite too.
                    <br />
                    The more one polarises the more one finds bridges and consolidation
                    <br />
                    necessary, pleasant, an unfulfillable wish. Freud lived in an era where the
                    <br />
                    military used to be seen as a vehicle towards progress (bellum pater
                    <br />
                    progressii), and a &quot;colonist&quot; was a brave, unselfish man who spread
                    <br />
                    civilisation amongst the uncivilised. So it takes no wonder, that the
                    <br />
                    terminology of functions of the brain became such a horrible authoritarian
                    <br />
                    and supremacist shnafu. The &quot;upper&quot; levels of consciousness, the &quot;animal&quot;
                    <br />
                    urges, the &quot;resistance&quot;, the &quot;defence mechanisms&quot;, &quot;overwhelming&quot;,
                    &quot;pockets
                    <br />
                    of misguided emotions&quot;, &quot;breakthrough&quot;, etc. lead us into the conceptual
                    <br />
                    landscape of the last years of the Imperial and Royal Academy of the
                    <br />
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was usual to consider &quot;me&quot;, the part of the
                    <br />
                    brain having gotten hold of the microphone as a self-congratulatory pompous
                    <br />
                    official Father, who has of course no needs and drives but thru whom the
                    <br />
                    Objective Truth and Values speak, whilst the opposing was everything
                    <br />
                    including filthy, cheating, crooked, sick, irritated, irrational, childish,
                    <br />
                    primitive, sensual (!), sensuous, intuitive, resilient and so forth, what
                    <br />
                    the &quot;real, objective, oriented, calm, concetrated, thinking, logical,
                    <br />
                    grown-up, etc.&quot; PR-agent of the brain has depicted itself.
                    <br />
                    Now we begin to realise that one lobe (or layer, or exciotation pattern) of
                    <br />
                    the brain haeps abuse on other parts of the brain, but both parts of the
                    <br />
                    brain are in the same cranium.
                    <br />
                    Consolidate this! would be the answer (with deNiro) to the allegory with the
                    <br />
                    clouds. The mystery with consolidating and consiliencing (?) is that it was
                    <br />
                    us who have de-consolidated and de-consilienced the concepts and now we
                    <br />
                    stand around and pretend we are surprised it is so hard to make them whole,
                    <br />
                    one again.
                    <br />
                    Specifically, one can and does describe in a neutral, sober, non-hysteric
                    <br />
                    way the interdependence between &quot;thoughts&quot; and &quot;emotions&quot;.
                    <br />
                    This present discussion about consiliencing reminds me of a discussion about
                    <br />
                    &quot;how can we integrate the wild, animalistic, original, unrestrained impulses
                    <br />
                    of a natural animal with the cool, logical, insightful, intelligent soul of
                    <br />
                    the crown of genesis, human?&quot; which never intended to come to results
                    <br />
                    because the possibility of integration would show that it is the rhetorics
                    <br />
                    of polarisation which had set these concepts apart in the first place. The
                    <br />
                    discutants of that time were shocked by the proposition (of Freud) that the
                    <br />
                    cool, intellectual, etc. is in some ways also rooted in an animal (-istic
                    <br />
                    nervous system).
                    <br />
                    Today, I try to put forward the notion that there are very many ways of
                    <br />
                    consolidating diverse observations by recognising similarities and
                    <br />
                    structural identities among the objects we find hard to consolidate. Only,
                    <br />
                    in this case the objects we look at are abstract concepts, like
                    <br />
                    &quot;information&quot;, &quot;predetermination&quot;, &quot;evoultion&quot;, &quot;order&quot;,
                    &quot;symmetry&quot;,
                    <br />
                    &quot;consilience&quot; and all this the FIS chat group has chatted about this
                    <br />
                    semester and the last few.
                    <br />
                    In Freud's time the critic went like &quot;but anatomy and physiology are not
                    <br />
                    sufficient to point out that we are in some ways also animals, and at least
                    <br />
                    comparable to animals in our urges and needs and impulses, because the Soul
                    <br />
                    and the Intellect are not muscles and blood, but transcendent ideas&quot;. Today,
                    <br />
                    the critic would be &quot;But numeric translations by means of the feature of
                    <br />
                    distinctness and similarity regardless of size do not show that space,
                    <br />
                    energy and matter have common density/probability/distinguishability
                    <br />
                    properties, because the Ideas and the Information and the Philosophy are not
                    <br />
                    numbers but Unrelated Concepts&quot;.
                    <br />
                    Making things fit together is not that easy if one does not want to become
                    <br />
                    obvious that one has broken them previously apart. What has made it
                    <br />
                    necessary to want to consolidate concepts? I wish for the next session of
                    <br />
                    FIS as a central topic the Incommensurability and the Distinctness of that
                    <br />
                    what we try to understand as being au fond similar.
                    <br />
                    Thanks for the Christmas peace and best wishes to the FIS from
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>Dear colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>Unfortunately the end of this session on consilience is close. Around this
                    <br />
                    weekend Malcolm will post his final comments on the philosophical
                    <br />
                    whereabouts of this fascinating concept...
                    <br />
                <p>The recent comments by Stan, John, and Bob add to the complex mosaic ---I
                    <br />
                    wonder whether the reflection on the cloud ascend/descend existing
                    <br />
                    asymmetry could contribute to clarify the panorama and unite some different
                    <br />
                    strands. At least, I would like to write down a few ideas that just reflect
                    <br />
                    my own fooliness around.
                    <br />
                <p>About &quot;ascend&quot; first. What is the driving force for it? No doubt it is
                    <br />
                    largely the creation, the imagination, the inspiration of the individual
                    <br />
                    scientist. The social-communal networking may introduce further checkings,
                    <br />
                    experiments, teams, discussions, etc., and then the crucial &quot;validation&quot;
                    <br />
                    aspect that any serious scientific journal or publisher will demand before
                    <br />
                    adding it to the existing Galaxy. In spite of the vast mechanization of
                    <br />
                    knolwdge operated in our times, I venture this creative (and validation)
                    <br />
                    theme has not much changed, and it won't. Scholarship (in its
                    <br />
                    interdisciplinary splendors) should be mentioned too.
                    <br />
                <p>The &quot;descend&quot; is much different. Although both are social-communal
                    <br />
                    processes, their differences cannot be more pronounced. Who
                    <br />
                    &quot;mandates&quot;for the descend, for the application? Rarely it will be the
                    <br />
                    imagination or the ingenuity of an individual (the isolated, creative
                    <br />
                    technologist). Rather, it will be mandated by a corporate body, perhaps the
                    <br />
                    &quot;committee&quot;, which may be present under multiple forms in an heterogeneous
                    <br />
                    collision of industrial companies, developers, institutions, the military,
                    <br />
                    political entities of all kind, markets, fashions, ideologies, etc., etc.,
                    <br />
                    who just want some bits of science &quot;on tap&quot; so to increase some apparent
                    <br />
                    &quot;utilities&quot; around. Application of science is thus marked by an
                    <br />
                    extraordinary heterogeneity of influences that continuously &quot;elbow&quot; on each
                    <br />
                    other, with the result that the extra-ordinary action capabilities allowed
                    <br />
                    by the clouds of scientific knowledge often become a destructive force
                    <br />
                    (Stan's).
                    <br />
                <p>All this means that the social &quot;closure&quot; of the two arrows of scientific
                    <br />
                    knowledge is quite peculiar and asymmetric indeed (in this, it far
                    <br />
                    separates from our own personal &quot;closure&quot; in the action/perception cycle
                    <br />
                    where symmetry considerations are really crucial---Berthoz's and Michel
                    <br />
                    Leyton's stuff could bring quite intriguing reflections on this regard).
                    <br />
                    All this also means the importance, in my personal opinion, of exploring
                    <br />
                    new approaches and angles about the heterogeneous collisions of knowledge
                    <br />
                    realms, starting by mopping up the misconceptions existing in our own house
                    <br />
                    of the sciences (Bob's on Wilsonian reductive consilience).
                    <br />
                <p>But, Have we been --both Wilson and herein at fis discussions-- performing
                    <br />
                    an undue overstretching on Whewhell's consilience? It is really a serious
                    <br />
                    question. Should we change gears, pay our respect to a very elegant
                    <br />
                    historical concept, and look for a new term? My own excuse to keep
                    <br />
                    defending the enlarged use of consilience is that finally heterogeneous
                    <br />
                    inductions --even of different disciplines and even of different realms of
                    <br />
                    knowledge-- have to &quot;conciliate&quot; each other in our own practice too,
                    <br />
                    Perhaps implying a common mental mechanism beyond the metaphorical abuse?
                    <br />
