Dear Jerry,
<br />
<p>thanks for your excellent clarification
<br />
on the nature of *organic messages* (your
<br />
answer to John) particularly as distinct from the 
<br />
engineering perspective (Shannon). It seems to me
<br />
that (logically) prior to message generation,
<br />
transmission, reception and interpretation (and
<br />
storage/retrieval of *past messages*?) there
<br />
is the question about the concept of *message*.
<br />
I have made some research concerning this
<br />
concept at the anthropological level. Here are 
<br />
a few results:
<br />
- A message is sender-dependent, i.e. it is a
<br />
heteronomic or *asymmetric* concept: we 
<br />
send (or receive) a message, but we 
<br />
ask for information.
<br />
- A message is supposed to bring something 
<br />
new/relevant to the receiver (form the standpoint of
<br />
the sender)
<br />
- A message can be distorted through *social
<br />
noise*
<br />
- A message can be coded and transmitted
<br />
(better:  offered) through different media
<br />
- A message has a (in a large sense, inlcuding
<br />
'tacit' dimensions in the case of objects)
<br />
linguistic character and causes a process
<br />
of interpretation from the receiver standpoint.
<br />
This implies some kind of *pre-understanding*
<br />
as well as an *autonomy* regarding the receiver's
<br />
interpretation. Luhmann makes the distinction
<br />
between *Mitteilung* (=offering a message)
<br />
and *Information* (=the selection of the
<br />
message and its interpretation (=*Verstehen*)
<br />
within the system)= *communication*
<br />
- Messages can be seen as *pragmatic
<br />
information* as they are supposed to influence
<br />
(in an imperative, indicative or optative way)
<br />
the receiver)
<br />
- We can conceive a sender that imagines to
<br />
have an (imperative) *message* for all human
<br />
beings in all times and vice versa (someone who
<br />
things *everything* is a kind of message to
<br />
him/her). There are individual and social
<br />
*deseases* related to these possibilities as
<br />
well as *steps* in between the extremes (dependent
<br />
on power structures concerning especially the
<br />
technical media used for message transmission)
<br />
- From an Aristotelian viewpoint we can distinguish
<br />
between form, content, goal and producers of
<br />
messages (Vilem Flusser has developped a
<br />
*comunicology* in which some of theses structures
<br />
are analyzed. For instance the difference between
<br />
dialogical (=create new information) and discursive 
<br />
(=distribute information) goal of communication.
<br />
- A key question concerns the criterium for considering
<br />
that a *message* has achieved (or not) its goal. I
<br />
think that this criterium is dependent on the above
<br />
mentioned parameters. In other words, I plea for
<br />
at theoretical (formalized) ad historical (or contingent)
<br />
approach to the (as you can see) non-trivial question
<br />
*what are messages?*
<br />
- My colleague Peter Janich has developed a *culturalist*
<br />
theory of information considering it (originally) as an
<br />
anthropological category (to be applied only analogically
<br />
at the biological and/or tecnical level). According to
<br />
Janich, information is concerned with a pragmatic
<br />
dialogue situation in which we may ask for something
<br />
that is invariant with regard to the sender, the receiver
<br />
and the way it is being communicated (for instance:
<br />
asking at a train station for an *information* about
<br />
when a train starts etc.). As far as I can see, *information*
<br />
and *message* are not synomyms, particularly with
<br />
regard to the above mentioned *asymmetry*
<br />
- If the medium is (not) the message... what are
<br />
messages? We have media theory but not a theory
<br />
of messages (or not as an object of a broad and
<br />
interdisciplinary (!) discussion).
<br />
I do not know how much biologists in general
<br />
and geneticists in particular can take profit of this.
<br />
For a more detailed (also empirical analysis) see
<br />
my (in German): <a href="../../www.capurro.de/botschaft.htm">http://www.capurro.de/botschaft.htm</a>
<br />
Carl-Friedrich von Weiszaecker would probably remark
<br />
that there is a (necessary) *circle* concerning the
<br />
question about *in-formation* (=determination of
<br />
form, genitivus obiectivus) as it happens to be at
<br />
the biological level, is (for us) dependent on what
<br />
we think to be a *message* i.e. of the determination
<br />
of form (genitivus subiectivus). But probably
<br />
modern biology is teaching is that a pure platonistic
<br />
(and idealistic) view is finally (for us) untenable as
<br />
(also) we are primordially message receivers.
<br />
kind regards
<br />
Rafael
