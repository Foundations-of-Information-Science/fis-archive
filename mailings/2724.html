Reacting to both Igor's, Pedro's &amp; Ted's communications:  The many
<br />
complexities facing us as society can be parsed as follows, using a
<br />
specification hierarcy:
<br />
{physical constraints (material/chemical constraints {biological
<br />
constraints {sociocultural constraints}}}}.
<br />
Here we an apply Ted's: &quot;My understanding is that when those information
<br />
abstractions (which evolve with the system) become overloaded, a new level
<br />
of the system is created, with new, &quot;cleaner&quot; abstractions.&quot;
<br />
<p>Ted continues: &quot;But it might be - and I am sure of this - fruitful to look
<br />
at layers &quot;below&quot; us.&quot;
<br />
Please note that the emergence of each more specified level is formally a
<br />
refinement.  Thus, with the institution of bological constraints, many
<br />
coordinate possible ways of being (based on various abiotic dissipative
<br />
stuctures) have been excluded.  That is, with this hierarchy being a tree
<br />
of possibilities, only ONE branch has been selected by biology.  That is to
<br />
say that vast amounts of complexity have been rendered moot by moving onto
<br />
one branch.  The emergence of socio-cultural constraints has refined the
<br />
number of possible relevant constraints even further. So here I agree with
<br />
Loet, who said: &quot;My main point is that the biological metaphor may be the
<br />
wrong starting
<br />
point for a discussion of social and cultural complexity&quot;. An example would
<br />
be, as I am experiencing even now, I do not have to worry about changing
<br />
temperatures as a winter storm (a physical perturbation)is approaching,
<br />
because my society has provided heating machines to eliminate this
<br />
worrying.  However, what happens if the electricity is knocked out by the
<br />
storm? Then would I have been cast back into biological world? -- not quite
<br />
because I now have warm blankets, fire places and other accouterments to
<br />
stave off physical danger.  So, it is often pointed out that with the
<br />
emergence of new integrative levels untold numers of possibilities are
<br />
opened up, as a blossoming of positive complexity opportunities.  What I
<br />
point out here is that untold numbers of negative complexities have been
<br />
left behind as well -- given only that the new level does not disappear
<br />
entirely.  Of course, the operation of social forces might unleash
<br />
previously hidden dangers, as when our culture invented atomic weaponry.
<br />
Prior to this we had little to worry about from fluctuatins in this aspect
<br />
of the physical world.  Yet even here it is social forces only that will
<br />
make these subatomic forces emerge to confront us directly.  In short, in
<br />
society we exist within a cocoon of reduced complexity.

<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Igor and colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your question is fascinating, perhaps at the time being rather puzzling or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even un-answerable...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What are the complexity limits of societies? Our individual limits are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious ---the size of &quot;natural bands&quot; depended both on ecosystems and on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the number of people with which an individual was able to communicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;meaningfully&quot;, keeping a mutual strong bond.  Of course, at the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time  the band was always dynamically subdividing in dozens and dozens of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible multidimensional partitions and small groups (eg. the type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evanescent grouping we may observe in any cocktail party). Pretty complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in itself, apparently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Comparatively, the real growth of complexity in societies is due (in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rough simplification) to &quot;weak bonds&quot;. In this way one can accumulate far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more identities and superficial relationships that imply the allegiance to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sectorial codes, with inner combinatory, and easy ways to rearrange rapidly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;under general guidelines. Thus, the cumulative complexity is almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unaccountable in relation with the natural band --Joe provided some curious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;figures in his opening. And in the future, those figures may perfectly grow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;further, see for instance the number of scientific specialties and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subspecialties (more than 5-6.000 today, less than 2-3.000 a generation ago).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Research on social networks has highlighted the paradoxical vulnerability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of societies to the loss of ... weak bonds. The loss of strong bonds is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comparatively assumed with more tolerance regarding the maintenance of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex structure (human feelings apart).  Let us also note that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considering the acception of information as &quot;distinction on the adjacent&quot; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argued weeks ago, networks appear as instances of new adjacencies... by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual nodes provided with artificial means of communication (&quot;channels&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In sum, an economic view on social complexity may be interesting but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;secondary. What we centrally need, what we lack,  is  a serious info
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective on complexity (more discussions like the current one!). By the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way, considering the ecological perspectives on complexity would be quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
