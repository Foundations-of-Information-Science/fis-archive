Dear FIS Colleagues 
<br />
<p>Please find below some thoughts related to the current discussion
<br />
on the Physics of Information.  I am not a physicist so some of the 
<br />
ways of approaching the issue may come over in a different way
<br />
to the usual scheme - anyway, here goes.
<br />
<p>The discussion presented below seeks to provide a partial catalogue 
<br />
of some of the 'tools of thought' that are used to talk about 
<br />
'information'. I think it will also be appropriate to other parts of the
<br />
FIS conference but make a beginning here.
<br />
<p>I have tended to apply the analysis to biological ideas regarding 
<br />
information but think there is some scope to extend the discussion to 
<br />
physics also. 
<br />
<p>At this point I am not directly addressing physical or philosophical 
<br />
problems but rather seeking to clarify the nature of the concepts and 
<br />
(possible) referents which people use.
<br />
<p>My basic argument why the following type of analysis is of value relates 
<br />
to comments made by Roche (1990) who notes that many concepts, even in classical
<br />
physics, are poorly understood. A simple example would be: how can I explain
<br />
the idea of (say) latent heat or free energy or information without using
<br />
mathematics or analogy ?   
<br />
<p>As a result of this kind of reflection, it may turn out that 
<br />
some ideas are mathematically defined but
<br />
may be physical artefacts. Others may be abstract objects in their own right.
<br />
I think PART of the problem of understanding the nature or existence of 
<br />
'information' is that no-one is really clear on its status.
<br />
Consequently, how can we get it to go beyond the syntax of mathematical
<br />
equations ?  This argument is also pursued by e.g., Rosen, Pattee etc.   
<br />
<p><p><p>Information Verbs to Metaphors
<br />
==============================
<br />
<p>Some background to the ideas discussed in this section 
<br />
can be found on the Metaphor in Scientific Thinking Web Page:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rcp/metaphor.html">http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rcp/metaphor.html</a>
<br />
<p>It is proposed that an analysis of verbs commonly used in
<br />
association with information can help clarify some of 
<br />
the boundaries of our understanding.
<br />
<p><p>&quot;is transferred &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt; &lt;via&gt; ... &quot;
<br />
This presupposes a CIRCUIT in which information flows.
<br />
What does transfer imply:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source - - &gt; destination (could be teleological)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carrier (see below)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow - - &gt; time, duration, cost of movement, direction ...
<br />
<p>Clearly, thermodynamic issues apply here as well as local interactions.
<br />
<p><p>&quot;acts on&quot; or &quot;is acted on by&quot;
<br />
In this case information becomes a thing or a force.
<br />
<p><p>&quot;interacts&quot;
<br />
There are a number of associated verbs in this area that can be related to
<br />
acts but also suggest many exchanges as in a society. In this case
<br />
<p>&quot;contains&quot; and/or &quot;is contained in&quot;
<br />
The container metaphor predominates a number of areas - not least
<br />
dominant ideas about hereditary information. 
<br />
<p><p>&quot;carries&quot; or &quot;is carried&quot;
<br />
This is similar to contains and CIRCUIT.
<br />
<p><p>&quot;information = form&quot;
<br />
This is common in certain biological discussions. It can be related to 
<br />
D'Arcy Thompson and subsequently to e.g., Thom's semio physics and
<br />
other arguments that organisms are coded representations of their 
<br />
environment.   
<br />
<p><p>Information : Glue, Verb and Relation
<br />
Information is involved/produced/generated when physical objects 
<br />
interact. 
<br />
<p>Further details:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~biocomp/areas/glue2.html">http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~biocomp/areas/glue2.html</a>
<br />
<p>Rephrasing a comment by Shroedinger, the most striking feature 
<br />
of quantum mechanics is the 'non classical'
<br />
kind of 'glue' that is called entanglement.
<br />
<p><p>Information, Meaning and Symbol
<br />
Cognition and interpretation may not be appropriate ideas in physics
<br />
although some authors make use of such reasoning in their proposals.
<br />
I'm sure this will be a developing theme as the conference
<br />
unfolds.
