Dear Stan, Pedro, group 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
One of the fathers of Cybernetic science R. Ashby defined information based
<br />
on both Shannon's definition of probabilistic entropy [-1*SUM(p*log(p))] and
<br />
Wiener's definition of amount of information [SUM(p*log(p))] as 'that which
<br />
removes uncertainty'. Both Shannon and Wiener suggested to measure amount of
<br />
information by the amount of uncertainty (probabilistic entropy) it removes
<br />
from a system... Obeying conclusions made on this list one has probably to
<br />
add that in order to be able to remove the uncertainty, information has to 
<br />
be meaningful. In this case meaningful information should be understood as
<br />
one side of information/probabilistic entropy or information/uncertainty
<br />
duality of opposites the same way as hot/cold, light/dark, white/black, +/- 
<br />
top/down dualities are. Direct relation between probabilistic entropy and
<br />
thermodynamic entropy is still undefined in terms of mathematics and formal
<br />
logic. Therefore before saying information is equivalent to enthalpy one has
<br />
to prove that uncertainty (probabilistic entropy) is equivalent to
<br />
thermodynamic entropy (I will get back to this in yet another post). 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Regarding 'constraints as covenants' among cells... What is constraint ? 
<br />
Formally it is a relation between several sets, that occurs when the variety
<br />
(in bits=log2(x)) that exists under one condition is less than the variety
<br />
that exists under other. In other words presence of any invariant over a
<br />
set of phenomena implies a constraint. Constraints also describe systems not
<br />
just as a product of our imagination but as real facts - objects as joints 
<br />
of nature or technology. Let's take a chair (an example from Ashby's book)
<br />
Movement of any free object in 3D Euclidean space has 6 degrees of freedom
<br />
Parts of a chair unconnected each would have its own 6 degrees of freedom.
<br />
Thus for legs have 24 degrees of freedom. However, after they are joined
<br />
into a system (a chair) they will have only 6 degrees of freedom as a single
<br />
object. Therefore the essence of a system is unity, rather than just a
<br />
collection of independent parts what corresponds to the presence of
<br />
constraints. In case of an organic tissue (population of cells) constraints
<br />
are not limited to geometrical space, but are projected on to a 
<br />
multidimensional functional space which can be described as a variety of
<br />
independent functions the cell is able to perform... Another axiom of
<br />
cybernetics (decay of variety) also states that as time progresses the 
<br />
variety can not increase and will eventually diminish as system will become
<br />
stabilized. Then as time goes both an observer's uncertainty about system
<br />
s state and uncertainty within a system itself can only diminish. So any
<br />
constraints in the light of the cybernetic definition of information as 
<br />
that which removes uncertainty' may indeed be regarded as 'covenants'.
<br />
Amount of information within a system also decreases with decreasing
<br />
variety. And this amount of information actually is the part which is not
<br />
meaningful (anymore). So one can conclude that meaningful information is 
<br />
that which removes meaningless information from a system leading all parts
<br />
of the system to synchronized functioning by synchronizing internal states
<br />
of its elements'. This phenomenon was named 'the law of Experience' by Ashby
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Let's try to look for more parallels between the second law of
<br />
thermodynamics and probabilistic entropy... It is clear that because of the
<br />
2nd law any system arriving to certain stability eventually will also
<br />
minimize entropy related loss of energy which is system's response to and
<br />
not the process defined by the 2nd law. This is yet another law to oppose
<br />
entropy - law of energy loss minimization. Thus thermodynamically we have a
<br />
duality of energy loss vs. energy optimization. I would not dare to think
<br />
that one of them is more important than the other, rather I would think they
<br />
have to be in equilibrium. When the 'weights' move to one or another side
<br />
because of changed constraints - system becomes unstable and tries to
<br />
re-stabilize itself and thus to reach that equilibrium again by arriving to
<br />
a new state stable both internally and externally. However if we take a life
<br />
cycle of any system we will see that there is a period when system's entropy
<br />
and variety indeed increase. In natural biological systems it is related
<br />
with growth, in technology it is related with production of a system from
<br />
parts - making a chair or a microchip for example. This is because
<br />
construction of any new system is based on increasing consumption and
<br />
destruction of other systems which may be considered as total
<br />
destabilization of those and which eventually leads to a temporal increase
<br />
of both thermodynamic and probabilistic entropies. But in any case system
<br />
ends up reaching equilibrium state with minimized variety, amount of
<br />
information and the both entropies. However most living and technical
<br />
systems eventually die, while life time of other systems increases moving
<br />
further apart from the center of complexity hierarchy/levels. Life time of
<br />
bodies is longer than that of cells, molecules or ecosystems live longer
<br />
than bodies, that of atoms or stars/planets is much longer and life time of
<br />
elementary particles or galaxies is very much longer than those. But it is
<br />
the life who overcomes this life-time problem by process known as
<br />
reproduction. 
<br />
