<p>
Dear Friends,
<br />
<p>everyone contributing to this discussion has his/her own concept of what is 
<br />
news, what is information. In some cases, the picture communicated is a 
<br />
juicy, emotionally appellative one (donkey, archaic heroes, rope, lovely 
<br />
feminine figure), in other cases information, this Rorschach-plate concept, 
<br />
is perceived as a mysterious, transcendent, active something that has 
<br />
(hidden) meanings. There are also many other mental images about what we 
<br />
experience if a curiosity is satisfied. (After all, information is that 
<br />
what we have received, the answer, not the question.)
<br />
<p>As many kinds of food as many kinds of hunger, as many ways of saying &quot;I 
<br />
have received something nourishing - now I feel better&quot;.  On having 
<br />
received information, some subtle biochemical processes in the brain are 
<br />
differing to their state before. A curious animal behaves differently to 
<br />
one that has found what it has been looking for. What are we curious about? 
<br />
About curiosity itself, about the ways we dream up open questions  and our 
<br />
ability to answer them. Let us not forget that the questions we deal with 
<br />
(&quot;meaning of life&quot;, &quot;meaning of information&quot;, &quot;well-ordered homeostasis&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;goals of creation&quot; and the like) are not empirical, factual questions but 
<br />
philosophical ways of looking at the world.
<br />
<p>Therefore, our answers cannot be right or wrong, they can at the most be 
<br />
pleasing, trustworthy, satisfying, wholesome, general, including, and 
<br />
ultimate.  An explanation is never right or wrong (as Russell has pointed 
<br />
out), it may be experienced fitting or less fitting. We deal with emotions 
<br />
as we try to satisfy our curiosity. Emotions being what they are, namely 
<br />
subjective, momentarily, diffuse in their meaning, there is an urge to 
<br />
clarify their meaning. This happens by getting ever more objective, 
<br />
impersonal, detached while talking about what satisfies the curious person, 
<br />
about what is the meaning of the term information. This is like turning a 
<br />
convention of maitre-chefs into a congress of nutritional scientists.
<br />
<p>You can't beat numbers on their ability to radiate the image of objectivity 
<br />
and solidity. This is like saying at a school of cooking &quot;forget the taste 
<br />
- what is the Joule value?&quot;. Some may find this approach tasteless, 
<br />
inappropriate or revolting. They may be right. Nevertheless, if one talks 
<br />
about feeding people (and in cooking, this is not an unimportant side 
<br />
aspect), the stripped-down numeric value of how many does come into play. 
<br />
The same is the story with biology, genetics, creation, life, heredity, 
<br />
information, abduction, nature, weaving and insight. It all boils down to 
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<p>Make your own decision, whether you believe that biology is rational or 
<br />
not. If biology is rational, it must be pictured in the rational world. 
<br />
Then it must allow for 'needs' to be satisfied. There must be a concept of 
<br />
a void into which some objects or parts fit better than other objects. Then 
<br />
we can understand ourselves as rational machines which have a void (namely 
<br />
a question) and look for an object that fits in (an explanation). I have no 
<br />
problems imagining my brain to have some local under-concentrations of a 
<br />
hormone and electrical discharges (what the layman terms &quot;thoughts&quot;) 
<br />
starting and stopping production of hormones until satisfied. I have 
<br />
developed the guidelines of a biological model doing exactly this. Allowing 
<br />
for local under-concentrations and sequences that initialize and stop 
<br />
production of substances. This is an utterly rational approach --it is a 
<br />
boringly rational approach.
<br />
<p>The reason I keep popping up and talking about numbers is that someone 
<br />
wrote that &quot;&lt;how&gt; and &lt;where&gt; have no connection. &quot; (Actually, it went 
<br />
like   &quot;But finally, philosophically speaking,the clarification of the 
<br />
*how* does not explain *time* itself.&quot;) This is simply inaccurate, or at 
<br />
least not up to date. Please read again the section &quot;Neighborhood and 
<br />
Cyclicity&quot; of my contribution, and you will find that the &lt;how&gt; translates 
<br />
quite well into &lt;here1&gt;, &lt;here2&gt;, ..., &lt;here_k&gt;, where the &lt;here&gt; (their 
<br />
number and distances among each other) are dependent on the &lt;how&gt;.  The 
<br />
number of steps along a sequence until everything is again as it was, is 
<br />
what is commonly termed &quot;time&quot;, and this is what all the discussion is 
<br />
meandering around: what is the news value of &lt;now&gt; being &lt;so&gt; and of &lt;so&gt; 
<br />
being &lt;now&gt;.
<br />
<p>The answer lies in counting the maximal number of &lt;how&gt;s and of &lt;where&gt;s 
<br />
and making combinations of them. Then one knows the meaning of the term 
<br />
&quot;information&quot;, without reverting to subjective poetry (nice as it may be). 
<br />
The theoretical answer is there, the question is whether we are ready to 
<br />
accept it or not.
<br />
<p>Let me make another allegory. It was well and widely suspected, known and 
<br />
proven that the Earth is round well before the Catholic Kings gave cash out 
<br />
to that cheat from Genova: ok now you go and show it. That was the truly 
<br />
revolutionary moment, not the scientific revolution, not the adventurers' 
<br />
readiness to risk their life on that unproven thesis that they shall 
<br />
reappear in the East. No, the real revolutionary was Isabella and Ferdinand 
<br />
(Pedro will correct me if it wasn't them.)
<br />
<p>Now we need someone who will finance the informational voyage. Let us dream 
<br />
it shall be a European king (or a queen!).
<br />
<p>Best wishes for the next post-conference session,
<br />
<p>Karl
