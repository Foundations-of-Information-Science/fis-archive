<p>
Dear John,
<br />
<p>I find very intriguing your paragraphs in response to Q1: 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, if self-organization is taken seriously, rather than merely as some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vaguish metaphor, there must be something that is dissipated to create and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maintain information. Furthermore, not just any dissipation will do; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will have to be dissipation of something of the right sort to permit the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relevant sort of information to form.. So, rather than give an answer, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ask the following questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is dissipated in the production of information within the cell? Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just energy, or is there a selection and disposal of information as well?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How much is the information budget of the cell hierarchical? Are the lowest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;levels primarily energetic, and does this continue in the same mode to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher levels, or are their specifically informational (control) levels in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the cell in which new information requires the dissipation of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at lower levels?
</em><br />
<p>My whole point about these questions is that you are inquiring about a
<br />
unitary info--but what if biological info appears in several 'flavors'?
<br />
Imagine that we are inquiring about a unitary 'force' in nature: probably
<br />
we could not advance too far in our analysis unless we further distinguish
<br />
the very different several forces at action (the 4 ones). Well, 'energy'
<br />
came to the rescue providing the unitary entity, and appearing today for
<br />
many people as the necessary referent to conceptualize info. So the
<br />
cul-de-sac, in my opinion, as the different infos would be far closer to
<br />
the 'forces' category problem than to the 'energy' one. 
<br />
<p>For me the living cell is the theater of at least three different info
<br />
varieties or forms (or processes?), structural, generative, and
<br />
communicational, interlinked in a variety of ways; and probably it should
<br />
be four ones, as the above 'structural' implies lumping together the
<br />
mission of membranes, proteins, enzymes, metabolites...  plus the crucial
<br />
antithetic work performed by constructive ribosomes / degradative
<br />
proteasomes. It looks an unsatisfying scheme, for myself too, but at least
<br />
provides room for making some further discussion of a family of related
<br />
concepts: representation, symmetry, function, life cycle, teleology... It
<br />
also highlights the unilaterality of those who think that enzymes only
<br />
interact by low-energy non-covalent bonds with their surrounds (Barham),
<br />
looking only at one type of communicational processes. But what about the
<br />
multitude of enzymes and proteins who suffer modification by
<br />
phosphorilation, dephosphorilation, methylation, acetylation,
<br />
proteolisis...  aren't these interactions covalent?, and aren´t they quite
<br />
crucial in gene expression (histone-code), cycle control, and even the
<br />
signaling system itself?  So my message is about not lumping together the
<br />
info dynamics (emphasis added on the 's') of the living cell under one
<br />
single category, otherwise we will always been talking about incoherent
<br />
properties, and we will never produce an interesting chart of the whole
<br />
bioinfo territory.   
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the brain, I think it is obvious that the formation of new information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires the rejection of dissonant information. Higher level concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aren't merely the sum of a lot of lower level instances, but act as filters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that sort and reject information. The question I ask is, can this be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usefully reduced purely to the processing of energy, or is there a special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sort of dissipation related to the formation of concepts? Alternatively, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept formation not really a case of self-organization, but merely a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fancy sort of reorganization that produces no new constraints?
</em><br />
<p>I much agree with the special dissipation idea, perhaps placing the
<br />
emphasis towards what I called 'abduction'. The capacity to selectively
<br />
destroy masses of info that we throw into irrelevence. Take the case of
<br />
laughter: as we argue in the final version of the fis 2002 paper (have a
<br />
look, it is brand-new) laughter makes much sense in the
<br />
info-hyper-saturated environment of human groups --as a genuine 'info
<br />
destroyer'. It throws into irrelevance items that had undeservedly taken
<br />
the attentional resources--and it leaves a pleasant background of generic
<br />
bonding among the co-laughing people. Again we are pretty unsatisfied with
<br />
the analysis we have done (although it includes intriguing formal chaotic
<br />
traces), but we believe that it serves to highlight laughter as a
<br />
'protophenomenon' of human socioinfo, strategically converging groupal,
<br />
emotional, cognitive &amp; neurodynamic strands. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The same questions can be asked at the firm level, but here we may also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have dissipation at the social level of communications and perhaps other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resources. What are the relevant resources? ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mark Burch and I extended our treatment of rhythmic entrainment, in both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the reorganization and self-organization cases to the social level: &#x201c;Order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Rhythmic Entrainment and the Origin of Levels Through Dissipation&#x201d;
</em><br />
<p>I agree that 'Rhythmic Entrainment' looks a very important organizing item.
<br />
Let us think for instance on the inevitable economic cycles. But how could
<br />
we connect your idea with the very info structures on which firms and
<br />
markets are founded? I mean, inventions such as money, prices, accounting
<br />
systems, markets, stocks...? Could other FISers produce their suggestions
<br />
about the 'info granularities' that emerge along the time dimension of
<br />
economic systems?
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
