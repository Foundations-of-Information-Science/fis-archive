&nbsp;Dear Loet, colleagues,
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would one not expect that the systems disturb each other in their recursive
</em><br />
selections albeit perhaps at the margins?
<br />
v: there is also a law of the first number (a.k.a. Benford's law)
<br />
accompanying the power laws (Zipf's, Pareto, etc). One can observe it in
<br />
nature as the presence of 1 dominant species in communities in amounts much
<br />
higher comparing with the rest species found there, etc... May this relate
<br />
with what you call margins ? Being an impatient speculator :) I would
<br />
imagine them as not necessarily margins in space but more as 
<br />
functional-interacting margins' or 'communication gateways' of those systems
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these disturbances are also recursive, this would again lead to powerlaws,
</em><br />
wouldn't it?
<br />
v: theoretically recursive, iterative and self-reference processes
<br />
(evolution, growth, learning, and maybe communication...) should lead to
<br />
many sorts of powerlaws, fractals, self-similarity. I guess...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In biological systems one would therefore expect powerlaws to prevail. But
</em><br />
in social systems, innovations are possible that would change the shape
<br />
(exponent) of the powerlaw? What would be the expectation in these cases (e
<br />
g., discourses)? 
<br />
v: however some properties of social systems such as size of cities and
<br />
business enterprises are known to perfectly obey zipf's law. Maybe
<br />
innovations are a natural part of those like mutations or genes drift in the
<br />
living part of the nature.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I assume that at a higher level of aggregation one would again expect
</em><br />
powerlaws in the distributions. Would it be possible to specify when one
<br />
would expect powerlaws and when not? Most situations are neither completely
<br />
random nor completely determined in social systems.
<br />
v: being on the edge of chaos (i.e. neither completely random nor completely
<br />
determined) is probably a property of the most systems in nature and those
<br />
systems usually are the systems showing behavior 'compatible' with power
<br />
laws. Uniform (i.e. truly random) distributions - do not.
<br />

<br />
I would suggest one more interesting reading related to Zipf's law and
<br />
communication in general. Their results strongly suggest that Zipf's law is
<br />
required by symbolic systems and is not a meaningless feature (!..) thus
<br />
reminding the last discussion on &quot;what is meaning&quot; on the FIS list:
<br />
Ramon Ferrer i Cancho and Richard V. Sole, 2003. Least effort and the
<br />
origins of scaling in human language. PNAS, vol. 100, no. 3. pp: 788-791.
<br />
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0335980100
<br />

<br />
And if you search www.nature.com articles for &quot;zipf's&quot; keyword the output
<br />
will contain ~10 articles from various fields of science including social
<br />
science and economics. Just an interesting stuff...
<br />

<br />
Best regards
<br />
Viktoras

Dear Viktoras, Stan, and colleagues, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Would one not expect that the systems disturb each other in their recursive
<br />
selections albeit perhaps at the margins? If these disturbances are also
<br />
recursive, this would again lead to powerlaws, wouldn't it? In biological
<br />
systems one would therefore expect powerlaws to prevail. But in social
<br />
systems, innovations are possible that would change the shape (exponent) of
<br />
the powerlaw? What would be the expectation in these cases (e.g.,
<br />
discourses)? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I assume that at a higher level of aggregation one would again expect
<br />
powerlaws in the distributions. Would it be possible to specify when one
<br />
would expect powerlaws and when not? Most situations are neither completely
<br />
random nor completely determined in social systems.
<br />
&nbsp;

<br />
&nbsp;Power-law frequency distributions are known to reveal self-similarity and
<br />
fractal geometry in the underlying structures (B. Mandelbrot, 1997. Fractals
<br />
and self-affinity). In other words they reveal hierachy of real-world
<br />
structures (systems) and their composition. So naturally they have to be
<br />
widely spread thus being a good proof for the theory of hierarchies too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Truly random events (characterized by uniform distributions) can not be
<br />
plotted in this manner. What's left - 'not (so) random' events/systems with
<br />
their internal structure and rules of their emergence/growth and
<br />
functioning/communication. So 'all what is left' follows power laws just
<br />
because they are parts of a structure being composed of yet smaller
<br />
structures, etc... Thus everything with fractal-like structure in nature is
<br />
a system.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In practice data points rarely ideally fits the power law distribution (not
<br />
a big surprise) and those distributions for different kinds of systems have
<br />
different slopes. So if data points plotted as a power law distribute into
<br />
different clusters along the line of power law (axes are logarithmic), then
<br />
most likely they belong to different systems. Or if some places show
<br />
substantial gaps, this should mean that system is under-sampled and it's
<br />
structure not completely represented.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Just suggestions. I am looking for more articles on this topic for more
<br />
proof. Also going to test those assumptions some time in future :)
<br />
with my own data.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />

<br />
So, given that one can find power laws EVERYWHERE in ALL KINDS of
<br />
data, material and linguistic (just as one can do statistics anywhere), how
<br />
do you construe it that the susceptibility of data to being plotted as a
<br />
power laws suggest systems? What would be a result of an Xi by i (rank)
<br />
plot have to look like in order to falsify your system hypothesis?
