                <p>
                    I think you hit a central point in this discussion as well is in the one
                    <br />
                    about Bell's inequality, but I (and SOA) would give it the arguments a
                    <br />
                    slightly different twist.
                    <br />
                    You said in reply to Ted:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why do we think that such a thing as quantum gravity should exist at
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; all? The only reason is again the Copenhagen dogma about the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; completeness of QM. If one assume that QM is not complete at all, so it
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not fundamental theory (and if one be even more provocative and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that QFT is neither fundamental and complete theory), then there
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no reasons to think that such a thing as quantum gravity exists.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; May be the real fundamental theory is purely classical and QM is just an
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximation of such a theory.
                    </em><br />
                <p>I think we have to go ever deeper below the surface of knowing and ask why
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;we do say that quantaum gravity exists - or that any phenomenon exists for
                    <br />
                    that matter. I mean after all it make a lot of difference if one says a
                    <br />
                    concept exists as a convention or in &quot;reality.&quot; If we cannot be clear about
                    <br />
                    what type of existence we refer to then we must leave all questions
                    <br />
                    unsettled.
                    <br />
                    If we cannot dig out the essence of what it means for something
                    <br />
                    ontologically &quot;exist&quot; then all our talking about &quot;ontological existence&quot; is
                    <br />
                    meaningless in principle - and bewildering. To my my this is what Bohr
                    <br />
                    refers to when he denies ontology - but he don not deny concepts to exists
                    <br />
                    by CONVENTION. The problem here is that conventional existence cannot be
                    <br />
                    proved by experimental means - and this presents a big problem to physics -
                    <br />
                    since many physicists seem to ask for an experimental proof of a
                    <br />
                    convention for its acceptance, which clearly is impossible.Bohr claim goes
                    <br />
                    further as he claimsthat ANY CONCEPT used in physics (and all sciences
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;- including mathematics andlogics) I would say - is a mattter of
                    <br />
                    convention.
                    <br />
                    This is why ontology is forbidden to Bohr's mind and my.
                    <br />
                    The force of gravity - as any force - is just an expanandum. In Newton's
                    <br />
                    classical definition F = ma; F is just an abstraction of feel explaining why
                    <br />
                    a &quot;body&quot; defined by its visal feel of mass change its velocity in a
                    <br />
                    visual impression, which is also a feel - however all felt by the same
                    <br />
                    subjective observer. F=ma is a relation of subjective feels (Newton's) that
                    <br />
                    is so clever that it gained the consensual acceptance as a model in physics.
                    <br />
                    F, m,
                    <br />
                    or a in this expression do in not explain themselves in any way or take
                    <br />
                    their places in an ontological domain unless we place them there BY
                    <br />
                    CONVENTION.
                    <br />
                    So classical physics cannot explain gravity and why should QM or QFT be
                    <br />
                    different? The problem is, to mymind,that we, as part of a scientific
                    <br />
                    culture most influenced by Plato maybe,
                    <br />
                    have misleading expectations. Some expect a theory to be able to explain the
                    <br />
                    &quot;essence of a phenomenon&quot; - which simply is to ask to much. If
                    <br />
                    ontology is forbidden - then also the &quot;what is&quot;-question is forbidden -
                    <br />
                    for the simple reason there is no answer to be found. The answer &quot;what is
                    <br />
                    gravity&quot; has no ontological answer - we can only provide an answer by
                    <br />
                    providing by reference to a model (of convention), which is an
                    <br />
                    epistemological answer. So
                    <br />
                    it seems your assumtion that QM and
                    <br />
                    QFT is neither fundamental or complete theory is a very useful one.
                    <br />
                    Futhermore this assumtion is useful for any theory - in case one expects an
                    <br />
                    ontological explanation or proof from a theory. This is impossible and today
                    <br />
                    even matematicians
                    <br />
                    know that we are not able to prove anything with certainty. Accordingly then
                    <br />
                    there is no reasons to think that such a thing as quantum gravity exists (in
                    <br />
                    its ontological sense) - since ontological existence is a misconception.
                    <br />
                    What exists is
                    <br />
                    personal experience - and Bohr is very clear on this point. Ontology is
                    <br />
                    forbidden - as is the idea of ontological existence. If something exists ...
                    <br />
                    it exists in the mind of a knower (not necessarily an observer). If a
                    <br />
                    society of knowers use a concept like gravity, mass or acceleration in
                    <br />
                    consensus they have decided that the idea of gravity, mass and acceleration
                    <br />
                    is useful in describing the physicist's experience - this is the al and the
                    <br />
                    end. We cannot come further (deeper) and we need not come futher - because
                    <br />
                    predictions effectively works on personal experience - and &quot;featureless&quot;
                    <br />
                    experience.
                    <br />
                    After all the term force of gravity is just a way to connect the everyday
                    <br />
                    man to
                    <br />
                    his very experince of feels - and this is good since it make him understand
                    <br />
                    mathematics - but does in no way give him (or other human beings) what is
                    <br />
                    the essence of &quot;force&quot;. We must be content with that we by convention can
                    <br />
                    provide a common model because then we can communicate and use our
                    <br />
                    experience in a
                    <br />
                    way that is scientific and moreover virtually MAKE SENSE.
                    <br />
                <p>Best wishes at all
