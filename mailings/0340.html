Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>This message is only another perspective of one of the many aspects that
<br />
characterize what I consider the worst crisis ever faced by the human
<br />
species since the civilizing adventure started to take place on the planet.
<br />
<p>The development of perspectivism aims firstly at making explicitly evident
<br />
how the validity of knowledge depends on the PERSPECTIVE from which that
<br />
knowledge is perceived and secondly at making clearer how the disciplinary
<br />
and mutidisciplinary validity of the Bertalanffian Perspectivism is a way
<br />
of getting closer and closer, though diversely, to the 'absolute truth' of
<br />
every aspect of the whole reality. Obviously all the perspectives, as views
<br />
explicitly expressed of a certain aspect of the reality, are valid. At the
<br />
same time none of them is more authentic than the other. This perspectivism
<br />
is the proper alternative between nihilism - the rejection to make an
<br />
effort towards the absolut truth because it is something impossible to
<br />
reach - and absolutism - the dogmatism that has generated the scientism,
<br />
which assigns value to nothing but science itself; and has produced the
<br />
bloodstained fanaticism in religious and political actions  (Symposium V of
<br />

<p><p><p>RESPONSE TO CRITICS OF THE MERIDA MANIFESTO (*)
<br />
<p>(*) Manifesto agreed in the First Latin American Colloquium on Interpretive
<br />
Systemology
<br />
<p>Thanks to elohimjl's initiative  the Merida Manifesto was diffused  to ISSS
<br />
and other organizations and individuals related directly and indirectly
<br />
with systems thinking and the systems movement. In the ensuing days to the
<br />
publication we got many reactions, some positive and some negative, some
<br />
showing a deep understanding of the grave and sensitive issues dealt with
<br />
in the manifesto, others very  emotional. Some people got very supportive
<br />
of the ideas expressed in the manifesto, others took offense with what it
<br />
was said. Let me reassure you all, before going on, that our intention was
<br />
not to offend the American people (or any other people or individual for
<br />
that matter). On the contrary, it is because we feel a high respect for the
<br />
American people that we think our duty to be very frank and discuss openly
<br />
and seriously the attacks of September 11 and the response of the US
<br />
government to them. A respectful human being, that is, someone who really
<br />
cares about another, when he/she honestly thinks this other human being is
<br />
being taken (in this case by his/her government) in a direction that may
<br />
bring serious harm to him/her and his/her people, must speak up his/her
<br />
mind and say his/her message loudly. This call to duty is even more
<br />
stronger when is humanity as a whole which is  involved in the situation.
<br />
<p>Coming back to the general reactions to the manifesto, we thank all of you
<br />
who have read it and  bother to send us your criticisms and/or support.
<br />
Nevertheless, I personally think  there have been some misunderstandings
<br />
and therefore I feel it is my duty to clarify  them.
<br />
<p>To begin with, let me remind you  the Merida Manifesto is the outcome of a
<br />
colloquium  of systems thinkers which took place in Merida Venezuela this
<br />
month (October). Two main interests brought together these thinkers. One
<br />
was their common preoccupation with the  radical turn the systems movement
<br />
has taken from its original founding values. Those were not only the need
<br />
to integrate the sciences but also humanity as a whole. World justice and
<br />
peace were main concerns of people like Bertalanffy, Churchman, Rapoport
<br />
and others. They thought that systems thinking could make a difference in
<br />
this world, concerning these issues. Gradually these ideals which
<br />
originally propelled the systems movement were replaced by market ideals,
<br />
i.e. by systems methodologies which can help to make money and compete with
<br />
others in all sorts of win-lost games. Many systems thinkers became
<br />
consultants and systems methodology salesmen for big business. The people
<br />
gathered in the colloquium thought we should reflect on this situation and
<br />
see if something could be done to protect and sustain the few groups that
<br />
still work under the aegis of the original ideals of the systems movement.
<br />
The second  common interest was the grave problems Latin America is facing
<br />
and how they are related to globalization and other  current world issues.
<br />
From our systemic perspective, the two interests turned out to be highly
<br />
interrelated.
<br />
<p>Now let me deal with some misunderstandings. One of them was in relation to
<br />
why a manifesto like the Merida Manifesto was released through a network
<br />
that has to do with systems thinking and in particular with the Bertalanffy
<br />
Anniversary Conference. Apparently some people thought the MM has nothing
<br />
to do with interests considered more proper of the systems movement. To
<br />
answer this query and for the benefit of those who are not familiar with
<br />
the systems movement, I will make a little bit of history. Bertalanffy is
<br />
not only the founder of the General Systems Theory but one of the
<br />
initiators of the systems movement. In fact the Bertalanffy Anniversary
<br />
Conference is celebrating the birthday of a man whose thinking was beyond
<br />
traditional disciplinary bounds. He was able to see the importance of
<br />
holistic thinking not only for the integration of the sciences but also,
<br />
and most importantly, for  the pursue of the  humanistic ideal of creating
<br />
an authentic global community, able to live in peace. He believed that to
<br />
make  this dream come true, a very important and basic systems thinking
<br />
principle had to be taken into account. Let us call it the &quot;perspectivist&quot;
<br />
principle. Such a principle is expressed when Bertalanffy says &quot;We must
<br />
begin protecting the individual and cultural identity of others&quot;. Surely,
<br />
the kind of protection, rather caring,  he was talking about was not merely
<br />
the one  provided for instance to American Indians in the USA government
<br />
reservations. These are, rather, the epitome of disrespect for these
<br />
ancient cultures. The only true protection of another culture is to let
<br />
that culture be, not to impose on it our values, no matter how dear and
<br />
wonderful one may think they are. In this sense protection is equivalent to
<br />
RESPECT for the values and dignity of others. It is also caring, i.e.
<br />
making sure their harmony within the whole is maintained.  However, true
<br />
respect for others cannot be felt unless one tries seriously to understand
<br />
the way other cultures see the world (i.e. their Weltanschauung). Another
<br />
founding father of the systems movement, Churchman, has expressed the same
<br />
systems thinking principle when he says that &quot;the systems approach begins
<br />
when first you see the world through the eyes of another&quot;.  In turn, seeing
<br />
through the eyes of another makes us aware of our own worldview, i.e. our
<br />
own presuppositions, values, culture and historical background. Here we
<br />
have in a nutshell the critical aspect of systems thinking. Good systems
<br />
thinking must be able to reflect on  its own assumptions and how we have
<br />
come to be and think as we do in the present.
<br />
<p>Now, if one reads carefully the Merida Manifesto, one will realize that it
<br />
starts precisely by denouncing a process undergoing in the Western world,
<br />
what we call the growing of anti-cultural forms, that impedes to reflect on
<br />
our own cultural and historical constitution, let alone see the world
<br />
through the eyes of another culture. One of these anti-cultural forms
<br />
embodies, apparently,  beliefs and cherished values of the West such as
<br />
individualism (i.e. the idea that everybody should be allowed to freely
<br />
choose the way of life he/she deems appropriate), the God of the market,
<br />
etc. plus the central idea that these values must be adopted by every
<br />
single human being on this planet, even if they have to be imposed by
<br />
force. Clearly this is an outrageous pretension and it certainly
<br />
disregards Bertalanffy's  systemic principle   mentioned earlier.  Now,
<br />
taking into account Bertalanffy's warning that  &quot;&#x160;we are dealing with
<br />
emergent realities; no longer with isolated groups  of men, but with a
<br />
systemically interdependent global community&#x160;&quot;  then a systems thinker must
<br />
expect that such imperialistic behavior must bring consequences for other
<br />
cultures in the globe including that of the US (i.e. feedback
<br />
consequences). In the Merida Manifesto we have pointed out  the
<br />
consequences  of this behavior at the most fundamental level of a culture,
<br />
namely, its constitutive practices: nursing, raising and caring. When these
<br />
practices are interrupted or destroyed the  devastation of precious
<br />
cultural soil is produced and a meaningless world arises, a world of
<br />
desperation and deprivation, a soil appropriate to grow people willing to
<br />
give their lives crashing a plane against a building or blowing
<br />
himself/herself in a pizza parlor.
<br />
<p>Therefore, this part of the Merida Manifesto is calling the attention of
<br />
systems thinkers in general, and those to attend the BAC 2001 in Viena  in
<br />
particular,  to focus  research efforts not only on rescuing the humanistic
<br />
ideals of von Bertalanffy and the systems movement but also, and together
<br />
with it, on  beginning to understand  this complex systemic process of
<br />
cultural devastation. Here lies, we are suggesting, the key to begin to
<br />
comprehend the horrendous (and by all means  questionable) attacks on
<br />
September 11.
<br />
<p>I expect the manifesto is now a little bit more clear to all of you and why
<br />
we (the participants in the Merida Colloquium on Interpretive Systemology)
<br />
thought it was appropriate to air it through the von Bertalanffy site. But
<br />
there is more. When some of the readers of the manifesto, like professor
<br />
John Warfield, react  and say that it contains  very negative comments
<br />
about the USA and its people, and that &quot;the world will be negatively
<br />
affected if the United States is unable to function&quot;,  I  must call your
<br />
attention to two points. First, in the spirit of von Bertalanffy's
<br />
aforementioned systemic principle, systems thinking is critical. This, I
<br />
repeat,  means a systems thinker, like professor Warfield,  cannot allow
<br />
himself  not to examine his own assumptions, the platform so to say from
<br />
which he sees the world. This is the reason why we in the colloquium
<br />
decided to examine some Western values, in particular democracy, and took
<br />
as a model the USA's world acclaimed democracy. What we found was  an
<br />
appalling schizophrenic behavior. While it is true that since its
<br />
independence from Britain successive USA governments are trying to build
<br />
within the United States a model of democracy, justice, freedom  and peace,
<br />
nevertheless in its foreign policy (at the back of its citizens, who very
<br />
often are completely ignorant of what their government is doing) they are
<br />
very hardly trying to set up a planetary tyranny (together with its
<br />
European allies) in Latin America, Asia and Africa. This is not just a very
<br />
negative comment we are making, with the purpose of offending USA citizens
<br />
(may be because we envy their freedom and prosperity!), nor is this another
<br />
piece of leftist propaganda. We are doing it because we have to expose the
<br />
serious contradictions of a government which promotes at the same time
<br />
democracy and tyranny, freedom and oppression, wealth and misery. This
<br />
behavior is a fact (see for instance the Chilean Files recently disclosed
<br />
by the CIA), often hidden from the American public by its own government by
<br />
all sorts of mechanisms, among them the media.  Now, what a systems thinker
<br />
has to do then is to face this schizophrenic behavior and  find a context
<br />
where it makes sense, i.e. a platform or point of view from which we can
<br />
see and understand such phenomenon. We can  even do better and try to
<br />
explain how have the US successive governments  gradually become so
<br />
schizophrenic, i.e.  the values underlying their foreign policy are just
<br />
the opposite of those behind their  domestic policy.
<br />
<p>We systems thinkers  gain nothing by closing our eyes and our ears and
<br />
claiming to the world that the American government and society are perfect,
<br />
and they have  done nothing to elicit these terrible terrorist attacks the
<br />
United States is suffering, and then clinch to the simplistic explanations
<br />
the media and president Bush and his government are given, namely  &quot;..these
<br />
are evil acts against  Western civilization and freedom&#x160;God is on the side
<br />
of the American people, they hate our freedom&#x160;etc.&quot;
<br />
<p>If we do not reflect, if we do not try to understand our deeper assumptions
<br />
about the world, and the consequences they have on our actions, if  we
<br />
decide to act just by mere impulse and the desire  of revenge, not only we
<br />
are not solving the problem of terrorism but we will contribute even more
<br />
to the mess and cultural desolation we in the West have created.  A systems
<br />
thinker cannot allow this to happen if he/she is really committed to the
<br />
systemic and humanistic principles von Bertalanffy and other founding
<br />
fathers of the systems movement expressed almost half a century ago.
<br />
<p>The second and final point is this. To say the world  will be negatively
<br />
affected if the US stops to function sounds like if the US stops the world
<br />
stops.  This may sound a bit arrogant but is true. Nevertheless, to a
<br />
systems thinker I am sure  such a statement  must be a challenge to his/her
<br />
thinking.  What kind of global system are we building that if one of its
<br />
components stops  the whole system collapses?  There must be something
<br />
seriously wrong with this world if this is the case. How have we  become
<br />
such a stiff and negatively interdependent world? How can the study of
<br />
anti-cultural forms we suggest  and of the growing desolation process
<br />
brought about by them  help to understand our current predicament?
<br />
<p>When I try to think systemically and seek to stand upon a different
<br />
perspective from that of CNN,    a perspective perhaps more open  to the
<br />
Islamic culture, the meaning of the tragic events of September 11 do not
<br />
appear as  an act of EVIL.  As Tony Judge (in his paper entitled Some
<br />
Questions diffused by elohimjl in this network) says: &quot;Rather than
<br />
characterizing the attack as an act of evil, I see it as a terrible  last
<br />
act of desperation by people who believed they had no other way to make
<br />
themselves heard than to resort to violence and mayhem. It is absolutely
<br />
critical that we see not only their willingness to use horrible, illegal
<br />
means, but that we also hear their desperation which makes them view such
<br />
means as the highest form of heroism including the sacrifice of their
<br />
lives.&quot;     	And I see something more. Humanity is at a crossroads and
<br />
systems thinking can either remain a good idea whose time has already past
<br />
or  stand up and make a vital contribution to our understanding and
<br />
comprehension of the current situation. The road the world leaders are
<br />
telling us is the appropriate to take in this historical moment I think is
<br />
utterly irrational and I am afraid will only reinforce the very same
<br />
historical conditions that brought us to the current situation in the first
<br />
place. I am sure the Western civilization has plenty of intellectual
<br />
resources to do better and the systems movement cannot elude this crucial
<br />
challenge. This is, I believe, the rationale that moved those who  signed
<br />
the Merida Manifesto to make it public.
<br />
<p>As the critics of the MM can see, it has nothing to do with  making
<br />
negative comments just for the sake of it nor it is irrelevant for systems
<br />
thinking and the BAC2001 site.
<br />
