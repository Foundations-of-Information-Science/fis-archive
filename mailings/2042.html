                <p>
                    Dear FIS colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>At the risk of adding to the current &quot;entropy&quot; of themes in the list, I
                    <br />
                    would like to enter a few points on networks in society, in economy and
                    <br />
                    elsewhere --just as a solo reflection!
                    <br />
                <p>To start with, why not discussing about the emergence of the social
                    <br />
                    networking phenomenon itself? Given that social networks are far beyond the
                    <br />
                    physicochemical happenstance (aren't they?), I think an interesting
                    <br />
                    &quot;foundational&quot; place to search by could be ethology, where we find a
                    <br />
                    relatively well-accepted concept to apply specifically to mammal groupings:
                    <br />
                    &quot;attachment&quot; (or inter-individual &quot;bonds&quot;: materno-filial bonds, family
                    <br />
                    bonds, groupal bonds, etc.). It is a rather bizarre point, I can accept,
                    <br />
                    but it may be an interesting characterization for a basic level of
                    <br />
                    networking in all human societies: a basic fabric of primary, very strong
                    <br />
                    bonds --family ties-- we find everywhere. Also, one could take ideas from
                    <br />
                    Jared Diamond, and from many others, to argue about the existence of a
                    <br />
                    further level of natural grouping or networking, based on a more labile and
                    <br />
                    versatile level of &quot;medium&quot; bonds linking together, for instance, the
                    <br />
                    members of hunter-gatherer bands (e.g., relatives &amp; 'friends').
                    <br />
                <p>Alas, with the creation of &quot;artificial ecosystems&quot; and the possibility to
                    <br />
                    complexify social nets, most societies have historically added a great
                    <br />
                    variety of new types of bonds. In my previous message I alluded to
                    <br />
                    &quot;partitions&quot; that imply very weak social bonds that we may somehow
                    <br />
                    experiment under the form of multiple &quot;identities&quot;. Economy is basically
                    <br />
                    involved here, of course, as it becomes the main source of transient,
                    <br />
                    volatile, but overall very efficient and productive &quot;weak bonds&quot;. Thus, the
                    <br />
                    &quot;organizational revolution&quot; as coined by Kenneth Boulding may also be seen
                    <br />
                    as a cacophony of multiple new classes of such weak bonds superimposed on
                    <br />
                    the primary level of medium and strong bonds. Retarded (or underdeveloped)
                    <br />
                    societies are unnatural, as much as are advanced societies --both depending
                    <br />
                    on artificial ecosystems and producing a very large ecological footprint--
                    <br />
                    but the former keeps a stronger net of primary bonds while the latter have
                    <br />
                    clearly less primary bonds and an extraordinary diversity of weak ones.
                    <br />
                    Amazing may seem, but statistics indicate that Nigerians have a higher
                    <br />
                    &quot;index of happiness&quot; than over-consumerism indulged US and Western citizens
                    <br />
                    (happiness would depend more closely on the structure of primary bonds
                    <br />
                    around oneself than on accumulation of techno-gadgets and obesity).
                    <br />
                <p>In the story of social networking, knowledge creation has also to be
                    <br />
                    involved, fundamentally, as the greatest transformations in social
                    <br />
                    networking have been preceded by great jumps in the social elaboration and
                    <br />
                    dissemination of knowledge --several scientific and industrial revolutions
                    <br />
                    as we have called them. let us note that, intrinsically, science and
                    <br />
                    technology partake the form of nets too, and some aspects of this very
                    <br />
                    discussion have already surfaced in previous fis discussions (&quot;locality&quot; of
                    <br />
                    sci. knowledge, interdisciplinarity, consilience...)
                    <br />
                <p>To sum up these crude reflections: ecological networks, social-economic
                    <br />
                    networks, scientific-technological networks, How are they related? Let me
                    <br />
                    finally suggest to our discussion chairs, Bob and Igor, that we look afresh
                    <br />
                    on these networks organizing principles, both specific and common--perhaps
                    <br />
                    among them: information, ascendancy, value... It may conduce to another
                    <br />
                    interesting approach to the sustainability theme.
                    <br />
                <p>best regards
                    <br />
