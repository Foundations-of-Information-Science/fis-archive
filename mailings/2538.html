<p>
Andrei,
<br />
<p>I have read some of the works of Hameroff, Penrose, Zizzi, Kauffman;  
<br />
and I have been fascinated by the Penrose-Hameroff “Orchestrated  
<br />
Objective Reduction” (Orch OR) argument.  I particularly have enjoyed  
<br />
Hameroff’s suggestion that consciousness caused the Cambrian  
<br />
Explosion, and Zizzi’s “Big Wow” theory that Orch OR happened right  
<br />
after everything coalesced into a single universe.  McFadden’s  
<br />
“quantum evolution” sides more with Prigogine and his entropy-spewing  
<br />
“dissipative structures.” Still, what they are saying that matters  
<br />
most about the quantum of anything are those teensy-tiny material  
<br />
structures like fullerenes and microtubules.
<br />
<p>Why should I bother with such things if I am trying to apprehend  
<br />
biological QI?  I really don’t think biological evolution reaches  
<br />
down far.  Frankly, I don’t think natural selection can distinguish a  
<br />
fullerene from microtubule any better than a dog can tell the  
<br />
difference between a gunnysack and a Persian rug.
<br />
<p>What seems oddest to me about this discussion on QI is its tendency  
<br />
to avoid any “quantum” aspects genetic information, which is taken by  
<br />
some to mean “pure information” (Dawkins); and, as such, it is an  
<br />
irreducible aspect of Darwinian evolution.  If there really is such a  
<br />
thing as QI in biological systems then the genes and their digital  
<br />
algorithms ought to be at least as important as the creative  
<br />
consciousness that caused the Cambrian Explosion to explode.  Would I  
<br />
be any more speculative if I proposed that genes are the outright  
<br />
manifestations of Orch OR, cooperating out of a coincidental  
<br />
universe, where little bits of matter matter less than no matter at all?
<br />
<p>Thanks.  I have had my two posts for the week.
<br />
<p>—Richard
<br />
<p>————————
<br />
<p>Dear Richard,
<br />
<p>As I pointed in my previous Emails, one should not identify the
<br />
mathematical formalism of QM (as well as QI) with its one special
<br />
application, namely, to the description of probabilities (and hence
<br />
information) for so called quantum systems. The formalism is
<br />
essentially very general. It could be applied in particular in biology
<br />
and genetics. But it should not be a reductionist application. One need
<br />
not try reduce biological processes to dynamics of quantum systems
<br />
(electrons, neutrons, photons, ... composing a biological system).
<br />
<p>My point of view (which was developed in details in my
<br />
book:Information dynamics with applications to psychology, cognitive
<br />
and social sciences and anomalous phenomena, Kluwer, Fundamental
<br />
series in Physics) is that the mathematical formalism of QM (namely
<br />
calculus of probabilities described by vectors and density matrices in
<br />
the complex Hilbert space) could be used everywhere we want to
<br />
represent information in the probabilistic framework by neglecting by
<br />
huge amounts of information (which we are not able to get) about
<br />
systems.
<br />
<p>I called such representations not quantum (by reserving the latter
<br />
terminology for quantum systems), but quantum-like.
<br />
<p>I do not think that such a thing as quantum biology or genetics could
<br />
be created, but quantum-like biological or genetic models might be
<br />
created and they could be useful.
<br />
<p>I would like to make comparasion with the problem of applications of
<br />
QM to decription of cognition. There was published a lot of paper
<br />
about QUANTUM cognition (e.g., Roger Penrose connected it with quantum
<br />
gravity). I do not think that there is some reality behind such
<br />
speculations. There is the huge gap between quantum and neuronal
<br />
scales!!! But we can speak about quantum-like cognition. In this
<br />
approach we do not try to reduce cognitive processes to real quantum
<br />
processes. But we say: cognition is a probabilistic representation of
<br />
neuronal information. THis is a probabilistic projection of the
<br />
detreministic world of billions of neurons to our feelings and
<br />
sensations which are nothing else but probabilistic images extracted
<br />
from the deterministic neuronal world. Since there is projection of
<br />
information, one could apply quantum like models: in my book there is
<br />
an algorithm for representing statistical data by complex probability
<br />
amplitudes. After this one can work in quantum mathematical formalism.
<br />
<p>All the best, Andrei
<br />
