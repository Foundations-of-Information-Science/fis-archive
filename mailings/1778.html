Dear Pedro,
<br />
<p>You wrote
<br />
<p>&lt;Some of the essence of information belongs to the boundaries with which we have to surround it.
<br />
<p>That insight, consiliently, applies to the Hegelian dialectic of limits and horizons, to fractal boundaries or to cloud regulation by the DMS of phytoplankton in the Gaia hypothesis. 
<br />
<p>An interesting example of horizontal consilience I came across recently was the use
<br />
of the term 'infotropic' in an article on astrocytic networks <a href="../../www.antanitus.com/hypothesis/default.htm">http://www.antanitus.com/hypothesis/</a> .
<br />
<p>'Infotropism' was invented by Ronald Reagan's favourite IT guru George Gilder
<br />
to describe (on the analogy of phototropism) networks which turn towards
<br />
data and clients (the Internet itself may be seen as an infotropic organism).
<br />
The term comes with the posthuman anti-Darwinian 'philosophy' that carpetbagging George
<br />
espouses but in the cited article it is used to describe the movement of astrocytic glia towards a neurotransmitter, guided by synaptic activity. Does infotropism provide a clue to 'operations of thought' and the informational dynamic as well as a possible explanation of epilepsy?
<br />
<p>Loet's recent comment about postmodern 'vapour' is also reflected in Gilder's view that computing is moving away from hardcoded systems towards 'vapourware' - the input changes the hardware, minds cobble brains. Our plane has finally landed in...Cloud Cuckoo Land at the Norbert Wiener Airport where 'information' has become uninformation, infotropic glial clouds.
<br />
<p>Continuing the meteorological metaphor, it would seem Ted Goranson's original concept of 'brainstorming' (with his lightning flash of insight) might turn out to be pretty close
<br />
to the neurological truth.
<br />
<p>Cheers, 
<br />
<p>John H

<br />
<p><p>Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>Thanks to Heiner, Stan, Aleks and others for their new aspects of the
<br />
metaphor. Clouds are perhaps the most subtle part of the Goddess GAIA --her
<br />
divine circulation through the giant water cycle that runs on the planet...
<br />
And in the globalized society of today, the knowledge clouds become the
<br />
subtle maintainers of the global circulation of goods and manufactures.
<br />
<p>Somehow, we should try to ensemble a new view uniting the God's view needed
<br />
for the intracloud phenomena (analytical philosophy, theoretical structures
<br />
and developments) with the terrestrial processes of ascent and descent,
<br />
where applying the God's view immediately destroys the whole intellective
<br />
limitations that surround our actions and perceptions (not our idealized
<br />
concepts). Let me repeat Whitehead's comments about the cipher 'zero' and
<br />
its consequences for modern science: &quot;Civilization advances by extending
<br />
the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking
<br />
about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle
<br />
--they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must
<br />
only be made at decisive moments.&quot; Some of the essence of information
<br />
belongs to the boundaries with which we have to surround it.
<br />
<p>Living in the cloud, we only consider &quot;fresh horses&quot; which infatigably
<br />
gallop from discipline to discipline, always towards the &quot;frontier&quot;. While,
<br />
helas, in the earth we become very tired workhorses. For instance, what is
<br />
the average conceptual size of a disciplinary filed (just as a network of
<br />
citations)? In how many citations we may run from an extreme to another? Is
<br />
is another &quot;small world&quot; case?
<br />
<p>I unjustly summarize too much, but reductionism, taken by Wilson as a leit
<br />
motiv or as a preferred tool to extend Whewellian consilience, obliterates
<br />
the most interesting aspects of the social problem of knowledge
<br />
(interdisciplinary dynamics &amp; closure). Science has provided societies with
<br />
an enormous range of new actions / perceptions (distinctions, measurements,
<br />
computations, instruments) which may be obtained by means of quite
<br />
intriguing communal aspects, that transcend the individual limitations in
<br />
an extraordinary way, both in the creation and the application aspects. But
<br />
stringent individual, institutional, social, national, etc., limitations do
<br />
persist. Just lets look around, how do we treat poor GAIA.
<br />
<p>A new &quot;cloudology&quot; needed!
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
