With regard to Rafael's post, we all use different terms and must
<br />
therefore, work around these. From my translation of Rafael's terms to
<br />
my own Peircean analysis, I can see certain similarities. That is, the
<br />
interpretive or interactional process is triadic and transformational
<br />
rather than direct, linear, dyadic. However, what should be stressed,
<br />
in my view, is that this transformative process requires different
<br />
levels and therefore types of codification. The triad given by Rafael
<br />
of pre-formation/ in-formation/ new-formation doesn't show us these
<br />
differences and we could view it as linear and serial rather than
<br />
transformation.
<br />
<p>One step, a median step, must be operative in a different process. In
<br />
Peircean terms, it is Thirdness, and is the process of generalization.
<br />
Some people have called this a digital code (Hoffmeyer, Pribram); the
<br />
point is, it is a process of condensing information and thus enabling
<br />
it to become general and applicable to numerous instances.
<br />
<p>Yes, there is a difference between the external and internal but I
<br />
don't think that an organism lives only within the internal. That is,
<br />
an organism's semiosic process must be both external and internal;
<br />
working within contextual links of information, and internal data and
<br />
internal habits.  This internal and external really has nothing to do
<br />
with the observer. I myself prefer to leave this individual out of the
<br />
picture.
<br />
<p>With regard to Pedro's differentation of the cell into three levels:
<br />
macro, meso and micro- I'm not in agreement. Purpose can't be confined
<br />
only to the macroorganism, nor do constraints operate only at the meso
<br />
level, nor does fuzziness operate only at the micro level. I think
<br />
that all these processes operate at all levels and can't be located in
<br />
size-regions.
<br />
<p>Abduction is a process operative within both sides of the experience:
<br />
the 'individual' and the 'environment'.
<br />
<p><p><p><p><p><p>John and Edwina,
<br />
<p>very interesting discussion on abduction. Thanks.
<br />
I think it is time to talk about the relation of
<br />
semiotics and hermeneutics and... to see if this
<br />
brings something to information science (related
<br />
particularly to biology). There is, first of all, the
<br />
triadic relation. It is a classical (particularly since
<br />
Heideggers Being and Time § 32) topic of hermeneutics
<br />
to make a distinction between:
<br />
(pre-)understanding - interpretation - understanding - new
<br />
pre-understanding...
<br />
The main point in this *circle* (which is supposed to be
<br />
a *constructive* not a *vicious* circle) is, that interpretation
<br />
does not produces by itself an understanding *out of nothing*
<br />
but is always based (and *biased*) on a pre-understanding
<br />
that it makes explicit giving thus rise to a new pre-understanding
<br />
etc.
<br />
This is related by Heidegger with regard to the existential
<br />
constitution of (human) existence and particularly with
<br />
regard to *signs*  (Being and Time § 17) in the sense that
<br />
the formal relations (&quot;Beziehungen&quot;) between signs (as explicited by
<br />
Husserl)
<br />
are not identical with the existentiall grounded relations
<br />
(&quot;Verweisungen&quot;)
<br />
in which we (in the life-world) are *already* immersed.
<br />
The point is now, in my view, to see how for in non-human living
<br />
nature (a cell, for instance) is *immersed* in a network of
<br />
*living relations* in such a way that the *horizons* of
<br />
pre-understanding-interpretation-understanding are more or less (!)
<br />
(how far?) fixed by *natural laws*. But there is a difference
<br />
between the way we (as observers)  see these relations and the
<br />
way an organism *lives* within them (Koichiro's different between
<br />
two different *time* views: exo/endo-view). So the phenomenon
<br />
of *abduction* could be seen, within such a hermeutic perspective,
<br />
as something that questions a given (implicit) pre-understanding
<br />
giving rise to a process of interpretation. Within *natural
<br />
philosophy* (or *biophilosophy*) we could speak
<br />
of pre-formation - in-formation - (new)formation
<br />
<p>kind regards
<br />
