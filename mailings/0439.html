----------------------------------------
<br />
<p>I am working my way through a brilliant book, SYMMETRY, CAUSALITY, AND
<br />
MIND.  Michael Leyton.  MIT Press.  1992
<br />
<p>I wish it made for smoother reading, but he is intent on establishing
<br />
theorems and principles that he can prove so the book plods a bit. However,
<br />
his ideas are very useful.
<br />
<p>For example, &quot;The meaning of an art-work is the process-history inferred
<br />
from it.  The experience of an art-work is the experience of inferring that
<br />
history, i.e., the experience of solving its history-recovery problem. &quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;There is a primary drive to seek causal explanantion; i.e. a drive
<br />
independent of, and not subservient to, any other goal.  In other words,
<br />
the history-recovery problem is a primary drive.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;(1) Each individual has a preferred amount of environmental asymmetry, an
<br />
amount that the individual seeks, and finds extremely appetitive. (2) As
<br />
the amount of environmental asymmetry is raised or lowered from this level,
<br />
the environment becomes more and more aversive.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;The Representation-is-Explanation principle states that any cognitive
<br />
representation is a causal explanation.  Thus, since aesthetics is the
<br />
intrinsic evaluation of causal explanation, aesthetics is the intrinsic
<br />
evaluation of cognitive representation.  ...this makes aesthetics
<br />
intertwined with the very substance of cognition.  That is,
<br />
since,...causality is the content of all cognition, we conclude that
<br />
aesthetics is the evaluation of cognitive content. &quot;
<br />
<p>A lot here I have skipped but one can get the general idea.
<br />
<p>I am attracted to the connection he makes..&quot;an important means by which the
<br />
mind recovers the past is by shape. Shape forms the basis for memory. The
<br />
mind assignes to any shape a causal history explaining how the shape was
<br />
formed. It is by doing this that the mind converts shape into memory.&quot;
<br />
These are principles that I have always worked with in making paintings,
<br />
and tried to express to students of painting.  Here we have a cognitive
<br />
psychologist going at the problem of and connecting it to basic cognitive
<br />
drives in the species.
<br />
