                    &nbsp;From Wednesday 3rd to Friday 5th May 2006 THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                    <br />
                    COMPUTERS &amp; PHILOSOPHY will be held at Le Mans University in Laval (near
                    <br />
                    Rennes, France).
                    <br />
                <p>Overview: Those interested in the study of philosophical problems and
                    <br />
                    related technological applications are encouraged to participate; in
                    <br />
                    addition to the suggested research areas provided in the list of topics
                    <br />
                    given, society's philosophical, epistemological, theological and
                    <br />
                    anthropological stances on the use of machines are of relevance to the
                    <br />
                    conference.

                <p>SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME
                    <br />
                    The increasing interaction between Philosophy and Computing over the past
                    <br />
                    40 some years has lead to many position-taking stances in theories of mind,
                    <br />
                    applied machine-embedded Intelligence and cultural adaptations to the
                    <br />
                    onslaught of robots in society. In the first instance, the Chair is seeking
                    <br />
                    short manuscripts contributing to the body of knowledge within or about the
                    <br />
                    intersection of the two fields &#x2014;i.e. are there established dialogues
                    <br />
                    between Philosophy and Computing? Is there a proper answer to the question
                    <br />
                    of whether machines can think? Contemporary thought on computers and
                    <br />
                    Artificial Intelligence is not the exclusive aim of the conference; the
                    <br />
                    arise of newer forms of machine intelligence can inform us about potential
                    <br />
                    human beliefs and permissibility thresholds with regards to technology
                    <br />
                    &#x2014;i.e. are all communities equally-footed with respect to machines that
                    <br />
                    speak, have desires and beliefs, autonomously increase their own learning
                    <br />
                    capabilities, develop bodily functions, play games with us, help us learn,
                    <br />
                    help children or the ill to express themselves, care-give the elderly, etc.
                    <br />
                    To this end, comparative studies and forward-looking accounts are welcome,
                    <br />
                    as well as reports on innovative uses of knowledge previously gained at the
                    <br />
                    crossroads of Philosophy and all &quot;Intelligent Machinery sciences&quot;. Breaking
                    <br />
                    news in Computer Science that &quot;pull&quot; the philosopher towards the
                    <br />
                    computationalist point of view on mind are equally encouraged; and so are
                    <br />
                    propositions that show the limits of representationalistic theories in
                    <br />
                    portraying the workings of mind or leading to multi-modal simulations (i.e.
                    <br />
                    suggesting post-cognitivist approaches or attitudes). The Scientific
                    <br />
                    Committee have taken note of the very convincing simulations of (not only
                    <br />
                    human) life that exist and thus remain open to originality, both in
                    <br />
                    presuppositions and visions, whether scientific or philosophical. The main
                    <br />
                    goal of the conference is to spur on interdisciplinary dialogue between
                    <br />
                    50-80 engaging intellectuals. Potential contributors may wish to use the
                    <br />
                    topics listed below for further inspiration.

                <p>&quot;Life and Mind&quot;
                    <br />
                    It's sometimes said, and even more often assumed, that life is necessary
                    <br />
                    for mind. If so, and if A-Life promises to throw light on the nature of
                    <br />
                    life as such, then A-Life is in principle highly relevant to the philosophy
                    <br />
                    of mind and cognitive science.
                    <br />
                    However, very few philosophers have attempted to argue for the relation
                    <br />
                    between life and mind. It's usually taken for granted. Even those (mostly
                    <br />
                    in the Continental tradition, including some with a following in A-Life)
                    <br />
                    who have insisted on the linkage have stated it rather than justified it.
                    <br />
                    If an evolutionary account of intentionality is acceptable, then perhaps
                    <br />
                    biological life 'makes room' for mind. But that claim is problematic, since
                    <br />
                    it's not clear that the type of self-organization involved in life-as-such
                    <br />
                    must necessarily include evolution. Even if it does, it's a further step to
                    <br />
                    show that life is strictly necessary for mind.

                    What are the future technological milestones that will drive changes in
                    <br />
                    relationships between people and machines? At different times in history
                    <br />
                    different technologies have been more or less significant in determining
                    <br />
                    people's attitudes towards machines as beings. Some technological trends
                    <br />
                    will soon change the way a non-specialist will relate to certain machines.
                    <br />
                    Other plausible changes in relationships may depend on scientific
                    <br />
                    realizations that are as yet uncertain. And perhaps we will surprise ourselves.

                <p>&quot;Computers as prostheses for the imagination&quot;
                    <br />
                    Many scientists' experiments are aided, or even made possible, by such
                    <br />
                    perception-magnifiers as microscopes and telescopes; philosophers' thought
                    <br />
                    experiments can be just as dramatically extended by use of computers to
                    <br />
                    discipline their imaginations. Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Life,
                    <br />
                    and evolutionary economics are best seen as new varieties of more rigorous
                    <br />
                    philosophy. And on a more informal, traditional level of philosophizing,
                    <br />
                    the concepts of computer science can help banish failures of imagination
                    <br />

                <p>&quot;Beyond Mind. How Brains Make Up Artificial Cognitive Systems&quot;
                    <br />
                    At the roots of thinking abilities there is a process of disembodiment of
                    <br />
                    mind that presents a new cognitive perspective on the role of external
                    <br />
                    models and representations. Taking advantage of Turing&#x2019;s comparison between
                    <br />
                    &#x201c;unorganised&#x201d; brains and &#x201c;logical&#x201d; and &#x201c;practical&#x201d;
                    machines the
                    <br />
                    presentation will illustrate the centrality to cognition of the
                    <br />
                    disembodiment of mind from the point of view of the interplay between
                    <br />
                    internal and external representations, both mimetic and creative.
                    <br />
                    The last part of the presentation will describe the concept of mimetic mind
                    <br />
                    I have introduced to shed new cognitive and philosophical light on the role
                    <br />
                    of computational modelling and on the decline of the so-called Cartesian
                    <br />
                    computationalism.

                <p>&quot;Foundations of the Formal Pragmatics of Discourse&quot;
                    <br />
                    Like Montague, I believe that pragmatics should use the resources of
                    <br />
                    formalisms (proof, model and game theories) and philosophical logic in
                    <br />
                    order to construct a theory of meaning and use. I will explain how to
                    <br />
                    further develop intensional and illocutionary logics, the logic of
                    <br />
                    attitudes and of action in order to characterize our ability to converse.
                    <br />
                    One important issue is to analyze the logical form of intentional actions,
                    <br />
                    to explicate the minimal rationality of speakers and the dynamics of
                    <br />
                    dialogues. By considering previous utterances and conversational goals, the
                    <br />
                    theory of meaning becomes more dynamic. It can better determine the force
                    <br />
                    and propositional content of individual illocutionary acts and the nature
                    <br />
                    of collective illocutionary acts to which speakers intend to contribute.

                    <br />
                    planning extended stays in the area. The two events are not held back to
                    <br />
                    back in order to allow time for sightseeing and rest. Laval is known to be
                    <br />
                    a city of character for its history, art and culture. Located on the
                    <br />
                    Mayenne River in beautiful Western France, it offers all the amenities of a

                    <br />
                <p>Authors must circumscribe the general idea of the final paper by writing
                    <br />
                    concisely. They should submit an electronic version of an extended abstract
                    <br />
                    (total word count approximately 800-1000 words). The file should also
                    <br />
                    contain a 150 word abstract that will be used for the conference
                    <br />
                    website/booklet. Keywords (up to six) should be provided as well as full
                    <br />
                    information concerning the authors (affiliations, titles, professional
                    <br />
                    addresses, telephone numbers, etc.).
                    <br />
                    The final full papers, to be submitted AFTER the conference, will not
                    <br />
                    exceed a total word count of 4500 words and will be accompanied by a word
                    <br />
                    count and an abstract of not more than 250 words. These post-conference
                    <br />
                    submissions for the 1st of August 2006 are to take into account the
                    <br />
                    comments made by the Scientific Committee during the conference. A selected
                    <br />
                    number of papers will be published &#x2014;after peer review of the final
                    <br />
                    versions&#x2014; in a special issue of an international journal (title TBA). The
                    <br />
                    Chair will also negotiate publication in a hard cover book for especially
                    <br />
                    advanced or brilliant pieces of research.
                    <br />
                <p>The submissions should be made electronically, written in a format
                    <br />
