Dear Michael,
<br />
<p>The philosophy of science on which you build your argument is on grounds
<br />
much shakier than the sciences on which it reflects, and it has moved beyond
<br />
the point of the Popper-Kuhn debate. For example, one calls this within the
<br />
philosophy of science &quot;the linguistic turn&quot; (e.g., Quine). It seems to me
<br />
that the sciences have been developed as specific communication systems
<br />
(discourses) which use, for example, arguments. My main interest is in how
<br />
these discursive structures develop and how epistemic considerations are
<br />
constructed and validated with them. Thus, the focus is on scientific
<br />
communication structures and how one can study these. Perhaps, one can call
<br />
this a communicative turn in the philosophy of science.
<br />
<p>Because the sciences develop both in terms of the information exchanges
<br />
(e.g., experimental results), the meaning provided to these informations in
<br />
discourses, and the validation processes in these discourses generating
<br />
provisional knowledge, the system under study is complex. Information theory
<br />
enables us to study such complex systems both dynamically and in terms of
<br />
their complexity. (In social science statistics it is difficult to recombine
<br />
the multi-variate perspective with the longitudinal.) Therefore, my interest
<br />
in these discussions is mainly from a methodological perspective. However,
<br />
my main theoretical interest is in (empirical) science studies or more
<br />
generally in the study of knowledge-based systems.
<br />
<p>It is a very clear result from the empirical study of the sciences that the
<br />
various sciences develop with different dynamics. You mention Kuhn who
<br />
already pointed to the different meaning of the concept of atomic weight in
<br />
chemistry and physics at his time. The differences with biology, for
<br />
example, are much larger--not to speak of economics or the social sciences.
<br />
For example, &quot;nature&quot; itself is considered in evolution theory as an
<br />
operation (&quot;natural selection&quot;), while in physics the natural data are
<br />
&quot;given&quot;. In economics &quot;selection&quot; is often defined with reference to a
<br />
market system. 
<br />
<p>Herbert Simon has proposed to think more operationally about the sciences in
<br />
terms of heuristics (&quot;truth finding&quot;) and problem-solving. This is not to
<br />
deny that the searching for truth assumes that some statements are more true
<br />
than others. I am not a relativist in that sense, but I think that we have
<br />
to think about the sciences in a more relaxed and reflexive mode: how do the
<br />
different sciences develop? how can we study these processes empirically?
<br />
can we measure the development of knowledge? is it possible to simulate
<br />
these developments? Such questions seem also socially very urgent given the
<br />
increased of the science-technologies in a knowledge-based economy, isn't
<br />
it?
<br />
<p>What will be validated as scientific and what not, cannot be said ex ante.
<br />
When Volta did his experiments with electricity, he himself proudly
<br />
announced them as a new philosophy as by the way did Newton in his time. One
<br />
of the major challenges of today is to study systems in which the humans are
<br />
enroled. Psychology with a more objective approach to studying human
<br />
behaviour has much advanced in developing scientific rigour in its methods.
<br />
When we study the sciences, the communicative structures add importantly to
<br />
the behavioural layer. 
<br />
<p>With kind regards, 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
Loet

PS:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we're all better off for that diversity. But, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worries me, is a possible diminution of the natural sciences,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where sloth, or unreason, or just selfish interest, may find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an excuse in ambiguous use of the term scientific method, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lack of a determined defense of the historical efficacy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those methods., for the publication of nonsense camouflaged
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a scientific imprimatur.
</em><br />
In the meantime, there are about 1700 journals covered by the Social Science
<br />
Citation Index against appr. 5500 by the Science Citation Index.
