This is a reply to Jerry (***):
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Let us discuss the concepts of &quot;element&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;quality&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;such in more depth and detail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;The word &quot;element&quot; can be understood both in a set-theoretical and in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;chemico-logical sense. The concept goes back to the Greek a-tomos (not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;divisible).
</em><br />
<p>***The concept of a number (in mathematics) is a unique abstraction - it
<br />
signifies a unique position in an endless sequence of unique
<br />
positions.  Peano named these successor relationships within a
<br />
defined group of axioms over one hundred years ago.
<br />
<p>Now I extend this definition by saying: &quot;The concept of a number includes -
<br />
above signifying its position in an endless sequence of positions cf.
<br />
Peano - a statement about the fragmentation of the entity this number
<br />
describes. A number is a description of an extent AND concurrently a
<br />
statement about the integrity of that extent. A value - matched to the
<br />
number - does not imply the integrity of the underlying concept.&quot;
<br />
Difference Peano - Javorszky:
<br />
Peano understands under &quot;5&quot;: &quot;This is an extent, signifying an extent
<br />
between the extents 4 and 6.&quot;
<br />
Javorszky understands under &quot;5&quot;: &quot;This is an extent, signifying an extent
<br />
between the extents 4 and 6. Furthermore, it signifies that the underlying
<br />
interval is not segmented. Possible other ways of writing '5' as a value are
<br />
:1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+3, 1+2+2, 2+3, 4+1. These descriptions are
<br />
Peano-equivalent, Javorszky-distinct.&quot;
<br />
<p>The concept of a chemical element is also unique and it also occupies
<br />
a position.  However, the notion of &quot;successor&quot; is radically
<br />
different in chemistry.  Roughly speaking, the combining capacity of
<br />
a chemical element is unrelated to the successor relation.  Same
<br />
terms, but very very different meanings in the two disciplines. Was
<br />
it not B. Russell who introduced this semantic trick in an attempt to
<br />
justify his logistics of &quot;atoms&quot; of logic?  A similarity of meaning
<br />
exists but it certainly is not an semantic &quot;isomorphorism&quot; that
<br />
builds a bridge between chemical logic and mathematical logic.
<br />
<p>The concept of understanding is to translate unspoken experiences into the 
<br />
public language. That chemistry has so far not been understood by 
<br />
mathematics is a marketing chance. If there were no subjective abysses 
<br />
between the concepts: &quot;set of understandable, logical relations&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;chemistry&quot;, there were no progress possible. Imagine how the situation was 
<br />
before trigonometry was discovered. There were things you could count, 
<br />
reckon and calculate and then there were distances and heights. There was 
<br />
of course no isomorphism between bushels of grain, gold pieces and the 
<br />
height of towers.
<br />
Progress is possible. Progress shows itself by being all of sudden
<br />
able to calculate something one was not able to calculate before.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;It is basically a tactile experience. If you can touch it and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;is of minimal extent, we call it &quot;object&quot;, &quot;element&quot;, &quot;idealised thing&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;such. If you cannot touch it and it is of a minimal extent, we call it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&quot;force&quot;, &quot;space&quot;, &quot;relation&quot;, &quot;logical principle&quot; and the like.
</em><br />
<p>*** The tactile experience is indeed important component of
<br />
distinguishing &quot;real&quot; stuff from abstractions, ideas and the like.
<br />
None the less, the concept of a chemical element also includes an
<br />
abstract component by virtue of its relations with other
<br />
abstractions.  Chemistry is thus a &quot;bridging&quot; discipline in which it
<br />
functions in both the world of ideas and concepts as well in the
<br />
world of sensory perceptions.
<br />
<p>Yes. Chemistry occupies itself both with the stable, static concept of an
<br />
&quot;atom&quot; or &quot;molecule&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; and as well with derived concepts like
<br />
&quot;valence&quot; and &quot;affinity&quot; and &quot;aggressiveness&quot; and &quot;nobility&quot; (in German,
<br />
they say The noble gases because they have no desires towards others)
<br />
This point we have complete meeting of minds, or have I not understood your 
<br />
injunction?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;As we play with cards, we distinguish the cards as physical things we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;bite on and sensually experience and the ways of playing (with) them which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;we cannot sense by older regions of the brain. Experiences we make before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;having learnt to speak we treat differently to experiences we store in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;parts of the brain the lexicon is in connection with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;So, we have avoided mixing (linking) the two levels up: the set of objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;and the set of their relations. Yet, it is a great difference if we speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;of a set, whether we mean the number of &quot;Sachverhalte&quot; (Wittgenstein: ~
</em><br />
logical facts) or the number of tactile things.
<br />
<p>*** In chemistry, this is unavoidable.  The meaning is determined from
<br />
the context.  When I use the word &quot;benzodiazapine&quot;, the reference may
<br />
be an abstraction as a set of atoms arranged in a pattern or it may
<br />
mean a drug for human consumption.
<br />
<p>Yes. Now we begin to see eye to eye. The idea is to look more into the
<br />
connection between what a thing is and how its possibilities to appear in
<br />
context are. (&quot;Ueber das Ding und die Moeglichkeiten seines Vorkommens in 
<br />
Sachverhalten&quot;) This is what the song goes about. Absolutely right. Now we 
<br />
beign to discuss, how many contexts are there if one uses n things.
<br />
This is the right approach. In how many distinct contexts can n things
<br />
appear? And how many of the n are distinct (within/among themselves)? Yes, 
<br />
this is it! Now we talk about the same question.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;My approach integrates the Kant concept of the thing as such and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Wittgenstein concept of the (number of) ways of being included in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Sachverhalte (logical relations). My starting point is to investigate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&quot;How many logical relations are there per object AND which fraction of
</em><br />
thing
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;is needed to represent a logical relation with?&quot;. These symmetric questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;touch the information carrying ability of carriers, therefore have some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;relevance.
</em><br />
<p>*** In chemistry, the logical relations are not a mathematical variable
<br />
in the sense that you are using the term, rather a property of the
<br />
element with respect to other elements as well as the circumstances.
<br />
The logical combining of chemical elements is highly dependent on the
<br />
reaction partner as well as the circumstances of the conjoining
<br />
environment.  This is one of the critical components of the endless
<br />
diversity of unique chemical substances.  This endless diversity of
<br />
chemical structure is also the source of living systems.
<br />
<p>Right. The question therefore is: &quot;a property of the
<br />
element with respect to other elements as well as the circumstances.&quot; - how 
<br />
many of these are there?
<br />
Maybe we should rethink the usage of the word &quot;endless&quot;. You will no doubt 
<br />
have seen satellite-made images of the Earth. We will agree that on this 
<br />
planet no thing can exist in an endless quantity. So please let us drop the 
<br />
term and the concept of endless. The question is: how many? We shall have 
<br />
to dwell on this point until we agree that the usage of the term &quot;endless&quot; 
<br />
in these 2 sentences is false:
<br />
&quot;This is one of the critical components of the endless
<br />
diversity of unique chemical substances.  This endless diversity of
<br />
chemical structure is also the source of living systems.&quot;
<br />
and, after that, reformulate the question with &quot;how many&quot; instead of the
<br />
obviously irrelevant and non-fitting term &quot;endless&quot;.
<br />
In short, both chemical mathematics (reactivity, selectivity) and
<br />
biochemical mathematics (reactivity, operations, selectivity) are
<br />
highly irregular compared to the natural numbers or to such
<br />
mathematical structures as groups.
<br />
<p>So the task is to find such a way of presenting natural numbers that the
<br />
pattern we observe will be reflected in the way we look at the natural
<br />
numbers. This task has been attempted by me (and with no small success, may 
<br />
I say.
<br />
<p>*** I will not comment on the issues of your languaging of &quot;partitions&quot;
<br />
and choice because I do not understand how your work relates to the
<br />
Mobius inclusion exclusion principle and related general methods for
<br />
identifying unique subsets.  I feel that your explorations are being
<br />
developed as our conversations continue.
<br />
<p>As I don't know what Mobius meant, I cannot comment further. I agree that 
<br />
as people talk they will find out if and how far they understand each other.
<br />
<p>Best regards
<br />
<p>Karl
