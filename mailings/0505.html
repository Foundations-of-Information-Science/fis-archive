<p>&quot;(1) Life emerged due both to material and information processes.
<br />
<p>(2) There is no information where there is no life.
<br />
<p>(1) and (2) imply:
<br />
<p>(3) Life cannot emerge!&quot;
<br />
<p><p>The fallacy lies in (1).  It is not correct to say that &quot;life emerged
<br />
due to information processes.&quot; Rather, we should say &quot;life emerged&quot; and
<br />
the thing that emerged was an information process. In other words, life
<br />
CONSTITUTES an information process. That is just what life consists of,
<br />
that is the very thing that emerged with the origin of life.
<br />
<p>If one believes that there was a time when there was no life, then it
<br />
must be admitted that life emerged. If one accepts my view that life
<br />
consists of a sui generis dynamics which constitutes information use (in
<br />
the form of low-energy triggers mediating nonlinear oscillators and the
<br />
circumstances supporting their dynamical stability), then the emergence
<br />
of information is no more mysterious than the emergence of life itself.
<br />
They are one and the same phenomenon.
<br />
<p>Now, I do not pretend that emergence, in any form, is not a little
<br />
mysterious. Furthermore, I must admit that the emergence of life is even
<br />
more mysterious than other forms of emergence. But the only alternative
<br />
to emergence is universal, Laplacian reductionism, which I consider
<br />
absurd. Emergence has now become quite well integrated into parts of
<br />
physical theory (especially, effective field theory). In this
<br />
connection, one must side with the condensed-matter physicists against
<br />
the high-energy physicists.
<br />
<p>So, within a general picture of a series of symmetry breakings from the
<br />
big bang forward, each of which gives rise to qualitatively novel states
<br />
of matter with new causal powers (cf. Walter Thirring's notion of the
<br />
&quot;evolution of the laws of nature&quot;), the emergence of life and
<br />
information becomes a little less mysterious. But the mystery will only
<br />
be throrougly dissipated when we have a real theory of the living state,
<br />
that is, a theory of information dynamics that can be properly
<br />
formalized, integrated into an expanded quantum field theory, and
<br />
empirically confirmed.
<br />
<p>I don't know how far away that day is, but maybe not as far as we think
<br />
(see the work of Emilo Del Giudice, Giuseppe Vitiello, Mae-Wan Ho, and
<br />
others).
