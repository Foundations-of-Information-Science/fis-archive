<p>
I do not like at all the so called &quot;kickoff&quot; BECAUSE it is applied to 
<br />
what I assume should be a constructive interaction.
<br />
<p>Football is only an image of the warfare that characterizes the 
<br />
prevailing civilization where each contender keeps fighting though 
<br />
claiming that it is playing,  till the end of the event, in order to 
<br />
be recognized as the winner after being defeated and necessarily 
<br />
humiliated the loser
<br />
<p>Anyhow as I hope it is only an incidental assumption, I dare to argue 
<br />
that the INFORMATION in every mind can be no more than a partial 
<br />
interpretation of some aspects of the reality that will be always 
<br />
&quot;infected&quot;, &quot;poluted&quot;, &quot;deviated&quot;, misinterpreted, etc. by the 
<br />
prejudices generated in each brain under the influence of knowledge 
<br />
(that will be always incomplete) and experiences acquired (that will 
<br />
be always individually limited)
<br />
<p>Therefore assuming that each one of us accepts to recognize as true 
<br />
and valid some of the statements expressed by Adam Smith, Darwin, 
<br />
Ramon y Cajal,... it will remain always as a continuous challenge to 
<br />
continue building the bridge. However, it seems evident that many of 
<br />
us from time to time believes that the bridge has been completed for 
<br />
making possible to cogitate a certain theoretical speculation or 
<br />
lucubration or for reaching a practical purpose while learning to 
<br />
survive one day after another.
<br />
<p>I dare to argue that  in my view (which is biased by the cultural 
<br />
values that I managed to assimilate, and certainly not always 
<br />
properly) the best approach about &quot;bridges&quot; between practice and 
<br />
theory is in the domain of Perspectivism proposed by Ludwig von 
<br />
Bertalanffy
<br />
<p>&quot;...the validity of knowledge depends on the perspective from which 
<br />
that knowledge is perceived. It represents  a world rich with the 
<br />
truth of many perspectives. It helps to comprehend the fallacy of 
<br />
absolutism. This Perspectivism approves in fact the Socrates' maxim 
<br />
that the learned person is someone who is aware of his or her 
<br />
ignorance. It is indeed necessary, for any human to maintain 
<br />
continuously open his mind to valuable new ideas, those that are 
<br />
generated by other minds trying also to comprehend the reality, each 
<br />
one through a particular discipline. The multidisciplinary views of 
<br />
any aspect of the whole reality make possible always its 
<br />
interdisciplinary assessment which may lead consequently to its 
<br />
transdisciplinary comprehension.&quot;

<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Koichiro,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks a lot for the very elegant 'primer'. For my taste, in a couple of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paragraphs (below), you have encapsulated the whole fis mission. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question (unfortunately have had no time to read carefully John's and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Andrei's yet, what I promise to do this weekend) is about the extent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which, in your opinion, we are advancing towards the collective synthesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ted was openly optimistic weeks ago...  Personally I think that in between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'Darwin' and 'Adam Smith' principles (fitness and utility) we are still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;missing a central arch for the theoretical info bridge. Curiously Ramón y
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Cajal attempted a principle of 'brain bookeeping economy' 100 years ago,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but has received little attention). Your posting strongly reminds me on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that missing arch...  (it reminds Leyton's neurodynamics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurosymmetries too)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;bookkeeping between supplier and consumer is the sole means for tailoring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;such an exquisite and unbelievable invisible hand. Adam Smith must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;anticipated what the 21st century would be going to accomplish in the name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;Information at the turn of the 21st century seems to be a thread
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;connecting physics, chemistry, biology and even economics. A common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;denominator is serious negotiation between supplier and consumer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro C. Marijuán
</em><br />
<p><p>Pedro,
<br />
<p>Your remark touches upon the relationship between Charles Darwin and the
<br />
economists of his time. In school, I learned that Darwin got his economics
<br />
from Malthus as a champion of the dismal science, instead of from Adam
<br />
Smith. Could it simply be a historical accident? If Darwin had consulted
<br />
Smith, the course since then would have been much more different than what
<br />
we see today.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro Matsuno
