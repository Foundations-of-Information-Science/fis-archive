Dear Koichiro and colleagues,
<br />

<p>I have snipped this first line from a longer and interesting post for 
<br />
comment.  A sometimes explicit, but often ambiguously implicit, 
<br />
difficulty in discussing the physics of information has to do with the 
<br />
definition of information itself.  I would like to suggest a hierarchy 
<br />
of information concepts, and labels for my categories (I don't really 
<br />
want to claim these categories as MINE, but I also don't want to impose 
<br />
them on others without their approval), that might improve the clarity 
<br />
of our future comments.
<br />
<p>As I see it, Shannon's familiar equation, H = - Sum p log(p), is a 
<br />
measure of POTENTIAL INFORMATION content.  The actual information 
<br />
encoded by the observed data depends on the configuration of the parts, 
<br />
which is not represented in Shannon's formula.
<br />
<p>The ACTUAL INFORMATION encoded by the observed data exists in the form 
<br />
of patterns in the data.  The extent of structure in the data is always 
<br />
&lt;= H.
<br />
<p>The PERCEIVED INFORMATION, which is the form of information described 
<br />
above by Koichiro, results from an interaction between the state of the 
<br />
observer and the observed data.  I think that this is an interesting 
<br />
and important kind of information, but its inherent contingency on the 
<br />
state of the observer makes it a particularly difficult (if not 
<br />
entirely intractable) platform for the development of a general theory 
<br />
of information physics.  Note that neither POTENTIAL INFORMATION nor 
<br />
ACTUAL INFORMATION embody such a contingency, which is the reason I 
<br />
turn to them in the context of discussions about the relationship 
<br />
between information and entropy.
<br />
<p>I am not claiming that PERCEIVED INFORMATION is unreal; rather I see it 
<br />
as pattern imposed on the observer by the act of observation.  In the 
<br />
context of human communication, as with this post, the goal of clear 
<br />
communication might be to recreate the geometry of a neural path in the 
<br />
brain of the sender, which encodes an idea, in the brain of the 
<br />
receiver.  There is a great deal of information re-encoding along the 
<br />
way (e.g., my writing these words, which become digitally encoded by my 
<br />
computer, which are decoded by your computer, and re-encoded into your 
<br />
neural paths), which makes communication error-prone; but I think that 
<br />
by far the most sensitive junction in human communication is the 
<br />
process of re-encoding by the receiver due to the strong dependence of 
<br />
the outcome of this process on the state of the receiver (e.g., as a 
<br />
result of past experience).  In principle, I see no reason why we can't 
<br />
develop objective measures of PERCEIVED INFORMATION, even for abiotic 
<br />
objects.   A rock rolling down hill can be marked by the event (e.g., 
<br />
it can be re-shaped), and these induced patterns would be the 
<br />
information perceived by the rock.  A good geologist may be able to 
<br />
infer this information by studying the rock, but he/she would never be 
<br />
able to learn everything about the hill or the rolling event because 
<br />
the PERCEIVED INFORMATION is extremely unlikely to faithfully record 
<br />
all of the ACTUAL INFORMATION encountered by the rock as it moved over 
<br />
the surface of the hill during its roll.
<br />
<p>I am very interested in criticisms of this framework, and if it is 
<br />
palatable to most, then I hope use of the terms POTENTIAL, ACTUAL, and 
<br />
PERCEIVED INFORMATION will help to clarify our future posts.
<br />

<br />
