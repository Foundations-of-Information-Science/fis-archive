                <p>
                    Karl:
                    <br />
                <p>I will respond to both your new title to the thread and to your
                    <br />
                    philosophy of mathematics.
                    <br />
                <p>When you ask the question, &quot;what is life, logically?&quot; what is the
                    <br />
                    nature of the question that you wish to address? Given your history
                    <br />
                    of posts, I am almost certain that I do not understand what you are
                    <br />
                    asking.
                    <br />
                <p>The principle issue that separates our views is not the nature of
                    <br />
                    life or information, it is the nature of scientific logic and a
                    <br />
                    philosophy of mathematics.
                    <br />
                <p>The concept of &quot;logic&quot; dates back to pre-Aristotelian days and it is
                    <br />
                    no clearer today, in my opinion, than when Aristotle defined his
                    <br />
                    views of causality and categories. (The small book, &quot;Logic, A short
                    <br />
                    introduction&quot; by Graham Preist, OU Press, is to be recommended.)
                    <br />
                    Model theory and various sorts of set theory are often promoted by
                    <br />
                    promoters. Yet, no one has succeeded in applying set theory to
                    <br />
                    chemical theory and phenomena. The oft stated claim that &quot;quantum
                    <br />
                    theory&quot; covers all of chemistry lacks supporting evidence. It really
                    <br />
                    refers to calculating properties of molecules AFTER one is given the
                    <br />
                    exact enumerations of structural organization in space.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone would like to demonstrate that quantum theory covers
                    <br />
                    chemistry, the place to start is to show how quantum theory applies
                    <br />
                    to a simple enzymatic reaction. For example, give an exact
                    <br />
                    calculation of the transfer of electrons from ethyl alcohol to NAD
                    <br />
                    via the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, starting from physical
                    <br />
                    principles. Chemists have developed exact methods to give an
                    <br />
                    accounting of the particles and their positions for this reaction.
                    <br />
                    The simple fact of the matter is that physical quantum theory is
                    <br />
                    derived from the chemical table of elements and chemical relations
                    <br />
                    and not vice versa. The list of chemical elements is an abstraction
                    <br />
                    about invisible particles with electrical properties and relations
                    <br />
                    among them. Chemical quantum mechanics simply places the objects in
                    <br />
                    motion. (Physical quantum mechanics is awash in the mathematical
                    <br />
                    approximations that attempt to use 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 different
                    <br />
                    mathematical definitions of force into a logically consistent
                    <br />
                    framework. Which notion of force should I believe in? Have you a
                    <br />
                    favorite definition of force? If one makes a sufficient number of
                    <br />
                    approximations, one can eventually fit empirical data - this is
                    <br />
                    remote from the exactness of chemical calculations!)
                    <br />
                <p>More generally, I believe that the nature of logic itself is
                    <br />
                    intertwined with the the semiotics of the symbol systems. Logical
                    <br />
                    methods are not general. We have many classes or types of logic.
                    <br />
                    These logics are intimately intertwined with the grammar of the
                    <br />
                    particular symbol system that is being used. The grammar of addition
                    <br />
                    is hardly the grammar of our emotions, is it? The grammar of music
                    <br />
                    is hardly the grammar verbal expression. The grammar of chemistry is
                    <br />
                    highly context dependent. a modal grammar that is closer to Aristotle
                    <br />
                    than to quantum mechanics and its inability to correspond directly
                    <br />
                    with human sensory perceptions. Can anyone point out how the axioms
                    <br />
                    of set theory or group theory express the grammar of genetic systems?
                    <br />
                <p>I point I am seeking to make is that the oft expressed notion that
                    <br />
                    certain logical statements are &quot;true for all time and place&quot; is a
                    <br />
                    statement that can not be placed directly in correspondence with
                    <br />
                    empirical observations in the many, many many areas of biology and
                    <br />
                    medicine.
                    <br />
                <p>So, when you ask, &quot;what is the life, logically?&quot;, I think you will
                    <br />
                    get many answers and that these answers are more apt to reflect on
                    <br />
                    the individual philosophy of mathematics and science and little to do
                    <br />
                    with the question.
                    <br />
                <p>For me, a rough answer that is little more than a tautology is &quot; Life
                    <br />
                    is a chemical system that co-operates with an ecosis to reproduce
                    <br />
                    systems similar to itself. &quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Enough venting of my views! A few comments are interlaced into to
                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; *counting the cuts together with the stitches is a principle that

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an idea for which the time is always right to propose, but
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; in times
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; afore, computers were not as readily available, so the idea was
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; investigate (because it involves quite a lot of counting). There is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; a little
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit of common sense to this idea, and it smells to the layman, too,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; like it
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be useful in chemistry and theoretical physics.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends on many factors, how an idea translates into profit
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (whatever form
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; profit will appear in). Among the factors that influence the fate
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this idea
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; you and your action or inaction are quite important and relevant.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for the inquiry whether one may model chemistry better than
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; heretofore by an improved counting system, which also considers the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; cuts along
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the stitches. The answer is positive: yes, this is the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; research is taking. More helping brains can well improve the speed
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; precision of the effort. Thanks again for thinking along.

                <p>Karl, your argument wanders over vast domains. What I am seeking is
                    <br />
                    a particular path, a particular collation of syllogisms (sorites)
                    <br />
                    that relate the concepts of number theory to the concepts of
                    <br />
                    chemistry, biology and medicine. If such a path is stated, then we
                    <br />
                    can compare the statements to particular observations in the
                    <br />
                    experimental sciences.
                    <br />
