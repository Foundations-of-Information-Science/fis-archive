<p>
Attempting an understanding of John Collier's posting given  below --
<br />
<p>He mapped systems with Atlan's &quot;infinite sophistication&quot; (which cannot be
<br />
modeled solely from the properties of their components) to computational
<br />
systems that do not halt given all relevant inputs, and so are not, in his
<br />
terminology, &quot;globally mechanical&quot;, as well as to Rosen's systems that do
<br />
not have &quot;synthetic models&quot; (i.e., model and system do not 'commute').
<br />
<p>Such systems (e.g., living systems) can, however, be &quot;locally mechanical&quot;
<br />
and support (Rosen's) 'analytical models'.  That is, some of their
<br />
functions can be given limited logical representations, one or a few at a
<br />
time.  Thus, there can be no global model of a cell or an organism -- and,
<br />
I would add, of any dissipative structure (i.e., complex, organized
<br />
material systems).  These have infinite sophistication just from the fact
<br />
that they can be classified as having scalar hierarchical structure -- that
<br />
is, they are susceptible to being classified as compositional hierarchies,
<br />
as in [context [whole [part]]]. A whole is 'emergent' from cohesion of its
<br />
parts in a given context.
<br />
<p>Biological functions and the traits entrained by them are the products of
<br />
biological inquiry.  Gell-Mann's and J. Crutchfield's 'effective' or
<br />
'structural' complexity is estimated by the length of a list of such
<br />
functions, each of which could be represented by an analytical model which
<br />
is stepwise mechanical.  The fact of infinite sophistication is reflected
<br />
as what I call (borrowing a term from Jerry Chandler) 'perplex complexity',
<br />
the aspect of complexity that makes it resistant to prediction.

------------------------------------------------
<br />
John said:
<br />
Pedro has pointed out a real problem, I think. I have a few words to say on
<br />
it that may be of some help in sorting out the issues. They derive partly
<br />
from my trying to make sense of Atlan's use of computational language along
<br />
with his claim that some biological (biochemical really) structures have
<br />
&quot;infinite sophistication&quot;. A structure with infinite sophistication cannot
<br />
be computed from the properties of its components. Sophistication, as far
<br />
as I can tell, is a measure of computational depth, which depends on the
<br />
minimal number of computational steps to produce the surface structure from
<br />
the maximally compressed form (Charles Bennett). Atlan has made the
<br />
connection, but also noted it is not fully clear as yet, since Bennett's
<br />
measure is purely in terms of computational steps, and is relative to
<br />
maximal compression, not components. Cliff Hooker and I noted these
<br />
problems (before we knew of Atlan's work -- well, I did, but it was
<br />
presented poorly by one of his students -- see Complexly Organized
<br />
Dynamical Systems, Open Systems and Information Dynamics, 6 (1999):
<br />
241-302. You can find it at
<br />
<a href="../../www.newcastle.edu.au/centre/casrg/publications/Cods.pdf">http://www.Newcastle.edu.au/centre/casrg/publications/Cods.pdf</a>). The
<br />
question relevant to Pedro's post is why is computation relevant if common
<br />
biological systems have infinite sophistication, and thus are not
<br />
effectively computable, even if they have finite complexity?
<br />
<p>Here is my stab at an answer: the notion of mechanical since Goedel and
<br />
Turing (I would say since Lowenheim-Skolem, since Turing's and Goedel's
<br />
results are implicit in their theorems) breaks up into two notions,
<br />
stepwise mechanical and globally mechanical.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A globally mechanical system can be represented by an algorithm that halts
<br />
on all relevant inputs (Knuth algorithm); these are computable globally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stepwise ones have no global solution that is effectively computable,
<br />
but are computable locally (to an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is similar to that between a Turing machine that halts on
<br />
all relevant inputs and one that does not. Both are machines, but only the
<br />
latter corresponds to Rosen's restricted notion of mechanical. So
<br />
computation theory can help us to understand the difference between things
<br />
that are stepwise mechanical, and things that are not. Things of infinite
<br />
sophistication are not globally mechanical. I will say without proving that
<br />
they correspond to Rosen's systems that have analytical models but no
<br />
synthetic models. They may still be mechanical in the weaker sense. In fact
<br />
I have not been able to see how they cannot be mechanical in this way.
<br />
<p>Consequently, there are Turing machines that are mathematically equivalent
<br />
to systems of infinite sophistication, but they do not halt.
<br />
<p>So you are probably wondering how processes of this sort can occur in
<br />
finite time. The answer is dissipation. I'll not give the solution here, as
<br />
my coauthor on another paper just came into the room and asked me how it
<br />
was going, and I said I was writing something else that was peripherally
<br />
relevant :-) A case in point is given in my commentary on Ross and Spurrett
<br />
in Behavioral and Brain Sciences titled Reduction, Supervenience, and
<br />
Physical Emergence, BBS, 27:5, pp 629-630. It is available at
<br />
<a href="../../www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/Commentary%20on%20Don%20Ross.htm">http://www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/Commentary%20on%20Don%20Ross.htm</a>
<br />
as well as the BBS site.
<br />
<p>All spontaneously self-organizing systems (see the Collier and Hooker CODS
<br />
piece) are only locally mechanical. I won't prove that here, but there is a
<br />
clue in the BBS commentary.
