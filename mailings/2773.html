                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; S: I'm not sure I see a distinction between meaning and mind as they
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relate to matter. I suppose matter + meaning might be one perspective

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the quoted statement is perfectly reasonable, because the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;common concepts of mind and meaning are distinct, while unification

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;is, in fact, what is being proposed.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, one might still note that meaning and mind are processual
                    <br />
                    relations, while matter is, in relation to that, just stuff. Then, while
                    <br />
                    meaning could be said to be unlocated or dispersed, minds are tied to
                    <br />
                    locales by being linked to matter. Meanings can drift and spread, while
                    <br />
                    minds are points of contact between them and matter.

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; material cause (physical stance), formal cause (design stance). For

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; completion we still want final cause -- directionality, which relates
                        to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intentionality, and efficient cause, which determines 'when', or
                        initiates
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the moment to be considered.

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not believe that my formal stance is related to Aristotle's
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;formal cause except in the sense that both relate to the concept of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;my ideas onboard. All I'm saying there (besides the fact that the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept of physical information is well established in physics) is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that sometimes we focus on form rather than substance, that this

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;accounts for the concept (in fact all the concepts) of information,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that we can call that focus &quot;the formal stance&quot;. I hope I

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to change my terminology.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I shouldn't think so -- but, using it, you do invite some
                    causal
                    <br />
                    obligato to your concepts. In the face of complexity, causal analysis can
                    <br />
                    never &quot;forget Aristotle&quot;, whose (updated) views on causality are the only
                    <br />
                    causal framework up to dealing fully with complexity. In that context,
                    <br />
                    your &quot;stances&quot; seem to be formal frameworks. Recognizing that, causality
                    <br />
                    necessarily intrudes.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, then you are just refusing to generalize. If we have
                    <br />
                    intentionality, the evolutionary perspective will insist that it had to
                    <br />
                    evolve from something more general(ly present in nature) -- nothing comes
                    <br />
                    from nothing. In my analysis intentionality can be derived from
                    <br />
                    functionality, and that from physical tendency (like the Second Law, or any
                    <br />
                    variational principle). Thus, {teleomaty -&gt; {teleonomy -&gt; {teleology}}}.

                    'evolutionary stance' there can never really be something truly new; only
                    <br />
                    refinements on what has preceded, with reduction of the original degrees of
                    <br />
                    freedom coupled to the emergence of new degrees of freedom. These 'new'
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom are always just coarse grained linkages between orginal
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom (thus, intetionality was episodically there in the
                    <br />
                    quark-gluon soup as fleeting configurations). So, what would FREE will
                    <br />
                    amount to? Just a seemingly unfettered selection from immanent

                    possibilities. Only &quot;seemingly&quot; because the willer has form (design,

                    This is in biology. All form embodies historical accident, and these come
