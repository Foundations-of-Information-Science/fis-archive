                <p>
                    Dear colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>After the recent exchanges, let me try a possible way to put economic
                    <br />
                    things in a more clear sense. It could be through the distinction between
                    <br />
                    &quot;infostructures&quot; and &quot;infrastructures&quot; --the former built up upon our
                    <br />
                    symbolic capabilities, neatly informational, and the latter being
                    <br />
                    productive operations that by themselves involve the usual physical
                    <br />
                    attributes and laws (not only entropy growth!). Conversely to Marxian
                    <br />
                    views, the infrastructure would be docilely conduced by the infostructure
                    <br />
                    (with dense feedbacks, of course, and admittedly following too schematic an
                    <br />
                    approach). The sort of infoeconomic or infodynamic processes governing the
                    <br />
                    material part of the economy involve very familiar terms --eg, value-- that
                    <br />
                    perhaps we can recast by some of the ideas argumented here, particularly
                    <br />
                    by Bob and Igor. A little story on &quot;the nail found in Zaragoza&quot; may be
                    <br />
                    illuminating...
                    <br />
                <p>In a very hot day, walking along the fields surrounding this very place
                    <br />
                    (CPS, in Zaragoza ouskirts) a student finds a big nail, very old artifact,
                    <br />
                    quite rusted, almost scrap. Its value: just as scrap iron, merely around
                    <br />
                    one cent ---if any of the recycling companies could be interested buying
                    <br />
                    it. However the student is curious, and takes the nail in order to show it
                    <br />
                    to some historians. It looks interesting: its manufacture is genuinely
                    <br />
                    medieval, it bears some marks or signs , etc. The value now ascends: one
                    <br />
                    hundred euros are offered by these new interested parties. Well, an erudite
                    <br />
                    archeologist intervenes: those marks are inscriptions that can be
                    <br />
                    deciphered and become latin &amp; french anagrams, and who knows why, but the
                    <br />
                    nail is starting to attract big media coverage--- journalists, local
                    <br />
                    museum, collectors, etc. Now all these new social networks which have been
                    <br />
                    altered are escalating the value to several thousand euros. Unbelievable,
                    <br />
                    but the most reputed erudite of this region (Aragon) reports that the nail
                    <br />
                    itself belongs to... Roldan and Charlemagne themselves!!! To their joint
                    <br />
                    war-chariot, in their frustrated siege of Moorish Zaragoza millennia ago).
                    <br />
                    Big, big hysteria: regional and national politicians, journalists and
                    <br />
                    novelists, all of Spanish and French Media, numerous TVs, Academies,
                    <br />
                    European museums, Hollywood producers, treasure hunters.... The value
                    <br />
                    emanating from the massive perturbation of a terrific number of flickering
                    <br />
                    social networks (&quot;disrupted bonds&quot;) is taking the value now to the millions.
                    <br />
                <p>Helas, as it frequently happens, it was an elaborated fake. Big scandal,
                    <br />
                    dense silence. The nail returns to the one cent value ---end of the story
                    <br />
                    (it literally happened in a museum in Israel, cheated around a King
                    <br />
                    Salomon's artifact, priced around one million--the source of my little
                    <br />
                    story on the nail).
                    <br />
                <p>Sorry for the bla, bla, bla, and for conflating notions of value and of
                    <br />
                    price. I just wanted to argue on the need to explore the info nature of
                    <br />
                    value, reconceptualzed as &quot;ascendancy&quot; derived from the activation of
                    <br />
                    multidimensional networks, being symbolically proyected onto a single
                    <br />
                    cardinality, and then becoming &quot;prized&quot;. Yes, it deals with a single event,
                    <br />
                    but when we regiment in markets and accounting systems all the regularity
                    <br />
                    of social production systems, we keep a strong record of the social
                    <br />
                    ascendancy of all the parties and processes involved (eg, look at the
                    <br />
                    enigmatic valuation of &quot;art works&quot; --the most expensive items of
                    <br />
                    societies). It is along similar lines, I think, that we might re-enter
                    <br />
                    notions of social entropy and other new ways of analysis, and not literally
                    <br />
                    as attempted in the present way by some.
                    <br />
                <p>We are here, in this list, playing with several important pieces of
                    <br />
                    knolwedge, from different individual sources, that we must massage and put
                    <br />
                    together with a lot of patience and common sense. It might be finally a
                    <br />
                    nicer story than the unfortunate &quot;nail found in Zaragoza&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Thanks for the patience!
