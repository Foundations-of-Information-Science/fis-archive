Hi Jerry,
<br />
I shall answer to those points which you address to me:
<br />
&quot;Karl ? Your response is appreciated.  My knowledge of number theory is
<br />
slowly increasing such that the algebraic roots of work are beginning to
<br />
show.  It seems that you wish to invoke numerous arithmetic operations in
<br />
order to get to a structure that is meaningful in the sense that you can
<br />
classify it into one of three classes.  (But, chemical classifications of
<br />
structures are exact!)
<br />
While chemical structures are represented as a multi set which could be
<br />
viewed like you partition, I do not see a further connection.   The
<br />
multiplicative functions of Sigma and Tau (of Gauss?) also do not seem to
<br />
vbe very useful.
<br />
Unfortunately, the arithmetic operations do not include the chemical syntax.
<br />
For example, the arithmetic operation of division is not applicable to
<br />
indivisible natural objects such as atoms and most molecules.  How do you
<br />
propose to deal with this important fact?   Another example is the fact that
<br />
Na+ and K+ and Cl- ions all operate directly in neurons ? without the
<br />
intervention of intermediary arithmetic operations.   How does one apply
<br />
mechanistic mathematics to these mechanisms?&quot;
<br />
<p>To the points you raise:
<br />
While chemical structures are represented as a multi set which could be
<br />
viewed like you partition, I do not see a further connection.
<br />
Yes, this is why I asked you to look up the chi-square function. Then,
<br />
maybe, you will indeed see further connections.
<br />
<p>For example, the arithmetic operation of division is not applicable to
<br />
indivisible natural objects such as atoms and most molecules.  How do you
<br />
propose to deal with this important fact?
<br />
Multiplication and division have as their implicit axiom that the underlying
<br />
entities are ALIKE (similar, have the same properties). You learn that you
<br />
cannot add apples and pears at elementary school. In the model I try to
<br />
massage into public knowledge there are several levels of units. Like
<br />
&quot;children&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;organ&quot;, &quot;cell&quot;, &quot;mitochondria&quot;, &quot;complexes&quot;,
<br />
&quot;molecules&quot;, &quot;atoms&quot;. Each of these is a unit on its own level.
<br />
We have a basic unit, named &quot;1&quot;. But we need at least 32 of these to make up
<br />
a unit, called &quot;&lt;has-no-name-yet&gt;&quot; or &quot;aggregation unit level 2&quot;. Of these,
<br />
we shall again need some few dozens to make up a unit called
<br />
&quot;&lt;has-no-name-yet&gt;&quot; or &quot;aggregation unit level 3&quot;. Giordano Bruno wrote in
<br />
the XVI-th century &quot;About the Principle, the Cause and Unit&quot;. The question
<br />
of what we consider to be a unit is a deep one.
<br />
In my investigations, I have found reason to assume that it is useless to
<br />
talk about properties of an assembly consisting of less than 6 or 7
<br />
elementar units. To be able to give a good definition of &quot;property&quot;, one
<br />
would need at least several dozen objects.
<br />
To my knowledge, there is currently consensus about the a-tomos
<br />
(in-divisible) being very well subject to splitting and fusing technologies.
<br />
(cf. fusion and fission bombs and reactors). So, maybe, your question is to
<br />
be rephrased in light of technological advances of the last 70 years.
<br />
<p>Another example is the fact that Na+ and K+ and Cl- ions all operate
<br />
directly in neurons ? without the intervention of intermediary arithmetic
<br />
operations.   How does one apply mechanistic mathematics to these
<br />
mechanisms?&quot;
<br />
Mechanistic mathematics proposes to 1) evolve basic types of
<br />
&quot;objects-with-properties&quot; (to do so, one MUST a) understand the chi-square
<br />
function and its applications; b) have understood the probability
<br />
distribution of partitions, by having generated a few dozen of these and
<br />
looked at the diagrams. Without having learnt Egyptian and Greek, the
<br />
Rosetta stone is of no use.), 2) categorise the evolved basic types of
<br />
&quot;objects-with-properties&quot; into a schema, which will look surprisingly like
<br />
the periodic system of elements; 3) understand the &quot;bonus&quot; piece of matter
<br />
not within the right (dexter, not proper. As opposed to left) assembly of
<br />
&quot;object-with-property&quot; (please see &quot;Possible Uses&quot; for details); 4)
<br />
understand the interdependence between freely circulating fragments and
<br />
spatially fixed main body (where is the right place for that which has this
<br />
property); 5) understand the interdependence between neighbourhood relations
<br />
of not-naturally neighboured entities (the &quot;tension&quot; one sees on M between
<br />
a) two halves of a grand period, b) between two periods.
<br />
After one has understood these preliminary banal basics, one will understand
<br />
by which intermediary arithmetic operations Na+ and K+ and Cl- ions all
<br />
operate directly in neurons.
<br />
On the other hand: do you actually argue that mathematics has no place in
<br />
chemistry? In this case, you would fall back to alchimistic grandstanding,
<br />
before Laplace and the Encyclopaedists and generally, Enlightement. The idea
<br />
of that period was that Nature is understandable and au fond, rational.
<br />
Please, do declare whether you believe that Chemistry is a part of the
<br />
Natural Sciences or whether it has something transcendental and religious in
<br />
it, not subject to mechanistic arithmetics. It is a different question, HOW
<br />
we can massage our concepts of measurements and what we believe to observe
<br />
into each other. I have no wish to discuss WHETHER Natural Sciences and
<br />
mathematics can be made congruent.
<br />
<p>Hope these answers have motivated you to ask someone to go thru the
<br />
chi-square distribution with you. That basic method details the relation
<br />
between expected and observed. One needs this.
<br />
<p>Thanks for your interest. Looking forward your next questions.
<br />
Karl

Betreff: [Fis] Number theory and chemical syntax
<br />
<p><p><p>Dear  John, Karl, Stan, Malcom:
<br />
<p>This response addresses several questions raised in recent contributions.
<br />
<p>I start with John?s contribution concerning language usage.
<br />
<p>Firstly, John,  I believe that your concerns  about language usage are well
<br />
grounded.  As long as we restrict ourselves to everyday events, we find ways
<br />
to communicate with one another.  When we move the conversation into any
<br />
technical discipline ? yes, even discussions of music or poetry, the
<br />
specialized usage of language limits understanding to a small fraction of
<br />
the community.  Is this not due to the richness of human mind and the
<br />
richness of theworld.  It is not necessary to ascribe mal intent to anyone.
<br />
Rather, the barriers to communication seem related the limitations of
<br />
individuals and individual goals and aspirations.
<br />
<p>John, with regard to your assertion about the phrase, ?I love you?, please
<br />
re-read what I wrote and you will find that we are agreement.  I attempted
<br />
to make clear that the metaphor was in terms of correspondence of meanings,
<br />
and not in the Heidiggerian sense of ?A is A.?  Obviously, when one moves
<br />
from one natural language to another, one often leave the exact historical
<br />
roots of each word with the first language and picks up a new historical
<br />
trace of roots and meaning in the second language.  Nevertheless, skillful
<br />
translation is still possible.
<br />
<p>With regard to chemical syntax, it is of critical importance that the atomic
<br />
numbers are in exact correspondence with the integers of the natural
<br />
language.  This exact correspondence relation is critical component of
<br />
chemical logic and chemical calculations.  Indeed, discussion of quantum
<br />
physics begins with the presupposition that this correspondence relation
<br />
exists ? without it, quantum physics would not be possible.  It is from this
<br />
logical root that exact correspondences within molecular genetics becomes
<br />
possible.  It is of important to keep the origin and roles of numerical
<br />
concepts crisply separated.
<br />
<p>Your quote of Saussure is of interest.  I would argue that a system of signs
<br />
is intrinsic to nature (chemical and biosemiotics) but that we have
<br />
unbounded freedom in alternative representations of the sign systems.  For
<br />
example, the number seven has a correspondence relation with seven units in
<br />
all languages that count to seven.
<br />
<p>You mention Koichiro?s brilliant arguments about quantum theory and time.
<br />
It seems the issue is how to apply Koichiro?s line of reasoning to living
<br />
systems.  I can image living systems being poised to act, but I struggle to
<br />
imagine how ?time itself? is poised to ?act.?   The more I understand of
<br />
mathematics, the more I find that physical theory and physical philosophy is
<br />
enslaved by mathematics.  No such enslavement has yet occurred in chemistry
<br />
or biology despite the repeated claims of the thought leaders of physics.  I
<br />
am not questioning the utility of mathematics, but rather the philosophies
<br />
that are often substituted for empirical knowledge.
<br />
<p>Stan asks for simple examples of chemical syntax.  For modern chemistry, the
<br />
first principles are well established for more than seventy five years.  The
<br />
atomic numbers form an ordering relation for all chemical elements that
<br />
correspond exactly with the natural language integers.  The identity of any
<br />
pure material is given by a multiset of atoms (molecular formula) and an
<br />
exact correspondence with the molecular structure (identity).  Any chemical
<br />
change conserves matter and necessities a role of time.  All chemical
<br />
changes are expressed as changes in structure.  The electroneutrality
<br />
principle applies to isolated substances ? the same size of the positive and
<br />
negative charges.    Any introductory chemistry text will provide examples
<br />
of the syntax.  The syntax of chemistry works to distribute elements over
<br />
structures in a regular manner.  That the syntax operates in living systems
<br />
has been repeated documented.
<br />
<p>(Karl and Malcolm:  Please note that application of set theory to chemical
<br />
syntax has not been demonstrated.  Presupposing that either set theory or
<br />
model theory is fundamental to informational concepts of chemistry or
<br />
molecular biology may or may not be fruitful.)
<br />
<p><p>Karl ? Your response is appreciated.  My knowledge of number theory is
<br />
slowly increasing such that the algebraic roots of work are beginning to
<br />
show.  It seems that you wish to invoke numerous arithmetic operations in
<br />
order to get to a structure that is meaningful in the sense that you can
<br />
classify it into one of three classes.  (But, chemical classifications of
<br />
structures are exact!)
<br />
While chemical structures are represented as a multi set which could be
<br />
viewed like you partition, I do not see a further connection.   The
<br />
multiplicative functions of Sigma and Tau (of Gauss?) also do not seem to
<br />
vbe very useful.
<br />
Unfortunately, the arithmetic operations do not include the chemical syntax.
<br />
For example, the arithmetic operation of division is not applicable to
<br />
indivisible natural objects such as atoms and most molecules.  How do you
<br />

<br />
Na+ and K+ and Cl- ions all operate directly in neurons ? without the
<br />
intervention of intermediary arithmetic operations.   How does one apply
<br />
mechanistic mathematics to these mechanisms?
<br />
<p>Malcolm ? you examples from the visual system are an excellent illustration
<br />
of the extraordinary sensitivity and perplexity of human sensory systems.
<br />
For practical purposes, I question if one wants to start developing a theory
<br />
of information from such data.  I am aware of Karl Pribram?s massive
<br />
collections of results.  By mingling discrete and continuous mathematics,
<br />
one is in constant danger of confusing the abstractions of mathematics with
<br />
empirically supported derivations.  Thin ice and dangerous sledding from a
<br />
theoretical perspective.
<br />
<p>With regard to the concept of mass, it is defined as a generic quality of
<br />
matter, in particular, of universal attractive forces.   If one wishes to
<br />
use this abstract quantity in either chemistry or biology, one is faced with
<br />
constructing a concept of species from a generic quality. Have you a
<br />
proposition on how to go about this construction?
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
