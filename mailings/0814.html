<p>
The Bertalanffy's Website               <a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
is once again ready for inviting everybody and also anybody to 
<br />
examine critically the reasons that have motivated some researchers 
<br />
to claim that at the dawn of the 21st century the Bertalanffian Way 
<br />
of Thinking ought to be explicitly developed, for searching out how 
<br />
to cope holistically with the worst crisis ever faced by humankind.
<br />
<p>Based on an evaluation of the previous attempt and also motivated by 
<br />
encouraging comments and critical appraisals, it has been constituted 
<br />
a Menu for allowing the visitor to choose one or another of the 
<br />
subjects, while offering some information for showing why this 
<br />
Website intends to answer consistently enough the question:
<br />
<p>Why Bertalanffy?
<br />
<p>??(*§'?%&quot;°#°*!!!
<br />
<p>Have been properly chosen the Bertalanffy's quotations?
<br />
<p>Have been good enough the interpretations that have been given to 
<br />
Bertalanffy thoughts?
<br />
<p>Would help Bertalanffy's suggestions to create suitable 
<br />
circumstances, for searching how to increase the survival chances of 
<br />
the human species?
<br />
<p>Answers to these questions and to additional questions that every 
<br />
visitor may suggest will be highly welcome.
<br />
<p>After recognizing that BAC 2001 (Bertalanffy's Anniversary 
<br />
Conference), which took place November 1 - 4, 2001 in Vienna, Austria 
<br />
was in a significant measure controversial - mainly because it could 
<br />
have been organized better - it seems valid to claim that from now 
<br />
onward a continuous exchange of views
<br />
<p>through bertalanffy-list                   (§)
<br />
<p>might help some more researchers, experts and scholars to prepare 
<br />
better, for the near future, another face-to-face debate about better 
<br />
ways of learning how to tackle the increasing number of larger 
<br />
(local, regional and global) problems that are arising everywhere 
<br />
generated partially by the unconscious dynamics of the prevailing 
<br />
civilization but seriously aggravated by belligerent reactions that 
<br />
have been primitively conceived against the unacceptable features of 
<br />
this civilization
<br />
<p>From now onward, the main aim of Bertalanffy's Website is to create 
<br />
the intellectual circumstances that are needed for encouraging the 
<br />
debate among the bertalanffy-list subscribers who no doubt will 
<br />
encourage themselves to express their views in a virtual Open Forum 
<br />
in order to examine how to use and develop one of the main 
<br />
contributions of Ludwig von Bertalanffy:
<br />
<p>the wholistic Systems Thinking or Top Ë Down approach
<br />
<p>which is indispensable for finding out a way forward for Homo sapiens sapiens

<br />
<p>ps 1. In addition we shall appreciate your suggestions for improving 
<br />
the technical features of this website. Besides we shall appreciate 
<br />
you let us know whether the software facilities that we are using 
<br />
cause you any trouble or difficulty, as it could be the case of 
<br />
flashplayer employed in the first page.
<br />
<p>Ps 2. Unfortunately we are confronted at present with some technical 
<br />
difficulties in the area of :: Submitted Essays inside: :: Reading 
<br />
Hall, which we hope to solve soon.
<br />
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(§) The bertalanffy-list that was used before BAC 2001 will continue 
<br />
in operation.
<br />
<p>Everybody is invited to subscribe on her or his own sending the message:
<br />
<p>subscribe bertalanffy-list
<br />
<p>to:
<br />
<p>lists&#64;igw.tuwien.ac.at
<br />
<p>The intended subscriber will receive afterwards a confirmation that 
<br />
his or her views will be received by the bertalanffy-list.
<br />
<p>Immediately afterwards the subscriber will be able to diffuse - among 
<br />
all the other subscribers - her or his views, through e-mail messages 
<br />
sent to
<br />
<p>bertalanffy-list&#64;igw.tuwien.ac.at
