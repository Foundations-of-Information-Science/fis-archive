Dear FIS-ers:
<br />
<p>I have not been very active sending in comments, because I felt that 90%
<br />
of the discussion has been dealing with philosophical questions, and
<br />
references to Plato, Aristotle, Heidegger, Kant, Peirce, etc., with which
<br />
I (a culturally challenged 20/21st_century space physicist,  
<br />
psychoacoustician and organist) am utterly unfamiliar. But before going
<br />
back home to Alaska, I want to send in a comment with a question and a
<br />
request. 
<br />
<p>I refer to James Barham's last entry of today, particularly the second
<br />
paragraph that begins with:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have argued that the correct way to look at information is as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;element in a special sort of dynamical interaction... 
</em><br />
<p>My question to everybody is: What is wrong with any or all of the
<br />
statements copied below from my FIS paper (Section 2 of &quot;On the Concept of
<br />
information.)? Would you please briefly tell me? (If you prefer, you may
<br />
send your comments to me directly to &lt;jgr&#64;gi.alaska.edu&gt;). Depending on
<br />
the answers I get, I will or will not submit this paper to Entropy. THANK
<br />
YOU for any &quot;pre-review&quot;!
<br />
<p>&quot;...We say that a (complex) system A is in information-based interaction
<br />
with a (complex) system B if the configuration of A, or, more precisely,
<br />
the presence of a certain spatial or temporal feature in system A causes a
<br />
specific alteration in the structure of system B, with a final state that
<br />
depends ONLY on whether that particular feature is present in A. ... (I)n
<br />
an information-based interaction a one-to-one correspondence is
<br />
established between a spatial or temporal feature or pattern in system A
<br />
and a specific change triggered in B; this correspondence depends only on
<br />
the pattern in question, being independent of other circumstances. ...
<br />
While in basic physical interactions there is an energy flow between the
<br />
interacting bodies or to and from the interaction mechanism, in
<br />
information-based interactions any energy required for the participating
<br />
(but not controlling) physical processes must be provided (or absorbed) by
<br />
a reservoir external to the interaction process. ... (I)nformation-based
<br />
interactions are usually &quot;discontinuous&quot;, in the sense that if the
<br />
original pattern at the source is modified in a steady, continuous way,
<br />
the response in the recipient may not vary at all in a continuous way. 
<br />
.. Although we have been talking about information, we must now provide a
<br />
more formal definition: information is the agent that mediates the above
<br />
described correspondence--it is what links the particular features or
<br />
pattern in the source system A with the specific changes caused in the
<br />
structure of the recipient B. In other words, information represents and
<br />
defines the uniqueness of this correspondence; as such, it is an
<br />
irreducible entity (the footnote here says: Think of the &quot;A-ness&quot; conveyed
<br />
in visual interaction with the symbols a, A, alpha, aleph, or the
<br />
&quot;three-ness&quot; conveyed by any set containing three elements. Note a certain
<br />
analogy between our definition of information with Cantor's definition of
<br />
integer number: &quot;that which all coordinable sets have in common&quot;). ... 
<br />
Note that in a natural system we cannot have &quot;information alone&quot;, detached
<br />
from any interaction process past, present or future: information is
<br />
always there for a purpose. ... (T)his indeed is Kuepper's &quot;pragmatic
<br />
information&quot;. ... Given a complex system, structural order alone does not
<br />
represent information-information appears only when structural order leads
<br />
to specific change elsewhere. ...&quot;
