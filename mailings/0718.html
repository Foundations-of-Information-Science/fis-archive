In reply to John Holgate:
<br />
<p>[ET]&gt; &lt;we cannot, as rational beings, operate in a world of 
<br />
personal opinions. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;That would be living in Plato's Cave.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[JH] Every time I go to a movie I am happily revisiting Plato's Cave.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occasionally it makes more sense than the 'real' world outside.
</em><br />
[ET] But you know that it is a movie and not real life. And a movie 
<br />
is reduced in complexity - otherwise, it would be open to too many 
<br />
interpretations.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
[JH] I support your call for rationality and mostly agree with the 
<br />
logic of your arguments but unfortunately the truth is not always 
<br />
rational or clear cut. We don't merely 'operate' as systems. We 
<br />
may think in a matrix but we live in a vortex.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My experience of the world must be much more Bayesian and fuzzy than yours. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the 'real hard empirical proof' in cases with 'hidden variables'? 
</em><br />
<p>[ET} I'm not saying that the truth is always clear-cut. I am saying 
<br />
that our experience must be open to validation. That a belief cannot 
<br />
be self-affirmed. Clear cut beliefs are operative in ideologies, such 
<br />
as those that are forever being posted to this list by Elohimi (sorry, 
<br />
I can't recall the name properly] and they are not only ungrounded 
<br />
but not open to verification. As for 'hidden variables' - I don't accept 
<br />
that. Too Hegelian for me.
<br />
As for the truth being rational, I believe that our world does operate 
<br />
logically rather than randomly. Certainly, randomness exists as 
<br />
well as freedom (not the same thing), but, overall, both freedom and 
<br />
logic interact in a 'logical' manner. And our perceptions must 
<br />
always be open to validation, or, rejected. I can continue to believe 
<br />
in a flat earth, but I must allow that belief to be open to proof.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
.&gt; 
<br />
[JH} Aren't opinions and beliefs only paradigms with varying 
<br />
degrees of fallability 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to time and place? 
</em><br />
[ET] No. You are taking a relativist view, which links the 
<br />
opinion/belief to a particular society/culture. I don't agree with this, 
<br />
for that denies the reality of the external world. The opinion must be 
<br />
kept open to ongoing validation. I cannot conclude, now and 
<br />
forever, that X is true. I can only conclude that, according to the 
<br />
evidence, at the moment, X is valid, but further research might 
<br />
change that conclusion.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[JH] However, the statement may not be completely unfounded. The evidence says that female gang 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rape is less prevalent than the male variety and that men aren't much good at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breastfeeding.
</em><br />
[ET] You are trying to preserve a fallability by irrelevant examples! If 
<br />
I put forward the hypothesis that women are as violent as men, 
<br />
then, that hypothesis can't be disproven by the example of 'inability 
<br />
to carry out gang rape', for violence is carried out in multiple 
<br />
manners. Equally, the physiological fact that men do not have the 
<br />
hormonal capacity to provide milk, says nothing about nurturing 
<br />
behavioural capacities in men. That is: the  ability to provide milk is 
<br />
not the sole indicator of the ability to nurture.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>[JH] If information is 'carried' by a sign or signal which reports truly 
<br />
on 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a state of affairs then the statement 'men are violent' (for you) is ostensibly false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and therefore non-information. False information is not information at all - you're either informed or you're not. The rubber toy in the bath is not a species of duck.
</em><br />
[ET}  No - I don't say that false information is 'non-information'. That 
<br />
would be setting up a scenario where only 'valid' data is 
<br />
information. I certainly don't agree with that! Most certainly, false 
<br />
information  'is' information. I have to explore it and find out whether 
<br />
its relations to the world are  valid or invalid.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
[JH} But if information is knowledge-independent (say as part of a 
<br />
physics of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pure information states as in 'It from Bit') then the misinformation is a 'distorted' form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the primary matter - 'men are violent' distorts the true nature of men as non-violent and nurturing beings (:
</em><br />
[ET] I disagree with the statement that 'information is knowledge-
<br />
independent'. It is knowledge-dependent. What is going on, in the 
<br />
universe, is an evolving 'knowledge' where bits of matter are 
<br />
'informemd' (set up into relations). These relations operate within a 
<br />
logical interaction; they are not random or the matter would rapidly 
<br />
dissolve. The relations, as operative in the logic, are knowledge-
<br />
dependent. But, this knowledge cannot be isolate. It cannot be a 
<br />
self-asserted belief. It has to enable information 'bits' to emerge 
<br />
that are validly operative in the real world.  Also, there is no such 
<br />
thing as a 'primary matter' in the sense that the emergent 
<br />
information is a copy of it (that's Platonic, and I'm not a Platonist). 
<br />
There is primary energy which is formed, by logical relations, into 
<br />
matter.
<br />
<p>So- those are my comments. Thanks for the input.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case the rubber ducky is nonetheless a kind of duck and represents a distorted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model of duckhood just like language and the movies both represent and distort the 'real' world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ironically 'It from Bit' and The Invisible Hand' take us back inside Plato's Cave - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'a world of primitive differences' without the true and false flipflop of Socratic logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe of intriguing 'white lies'.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I agree with much but not all,  of what John Holgate says. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aware that Pedro finds my criticisms of subjective opinions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'uninteresting', but we cannot, as rational beings, operate in a world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of personal opinions. That would be living in Plato's Cave.  What we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclude, must be based on evidence -both actual and logical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [John Holgate]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If opinions are low-grade beliefs and knowledge is justified true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief then opinions and knowledge are not binary opposites but part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a continuum of belief ranging from 'subjective'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fanatacism and evangelism to 'objective' scientific truth. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opinions of Giordano Bruno were considered illogical and evangelical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their time. Later they became acceptable beliefs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and components of a body of knowledge. Given other circumstances even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Charles Peirce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or Germaine Greer) might have been burnt at the stake for heresy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Edwina]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No - here I would disagree. You are defining knowledge and truth as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resting only in the 'most common' opinion. You are retaining its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition as a 'belief' and defining their validity only when they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become believed by the majority. This is merely moving, in Plato's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cave or Bacon's world, from the belief held by the individual to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief held by the group. From 'doxa' to 'pistis' for Plato' - and -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bacon's 'Theatre'. And - the fallacy of 'the popular opinion'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether held by one individual or a group, it's still an opinion and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless grounded in real hard empirical proof as well as logic - it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fallacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [John Holgate]The truth of a belief is not in its logicality but in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its justification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That pregnant unwed mothers should be decapitated is quite a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief for the Nigerian government but it is not an (ethically)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justified belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Edwina] Again, a belief can't be defined as truthful only if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justified. That is setting up a Truth Formula where your premisses can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be completely invalid but, as long as you have premisses, then, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define your beliefs as 'valid'. ie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     All unwed mothers are evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This woman is an unwed mother
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Therefore, this woman is evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The premisses are opinions and require proof. The society has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define the nature of evil and the actual proof that an unwed  mother
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actualizes that. I think that all the society could do to justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself would be pure tautologies. It cannot prove, empirically, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is any relationship.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [John Holgate]What role does 'information' play in all this? Is it, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it exists at all, a kind of ubiquitous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crap-detector or a cognitive mist we have to pass through to get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the truth?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Luciano Floridi's paper addresses the question from a hardcore logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with his 'alethic' approach but the jury is still out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view misinformation is a distortion of true belief rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an absence of information altogether.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your opinion?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Edwina] I consider misinformation both a distortion and an absence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If someone tells me that 'women are nurturing' and 'men are violent',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I consider this merely an opinion, unfounded as well as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misinformed. Therefore, it is an absence of information, for if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaker went to empirical tests, they would find that the statement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply, empirically, false. Their conclusion is ignoring information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and takes the next step of simply 'making up' the conclusion...without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any evidential premisses.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: opinions vs knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, I ask why are evangelistic opinions posted to this discussion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; site? The reply to my rejection of the evangelistic post about women
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having innate 'love' capacities while men do not and therefore, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can 'save the world' was yet another post filled with illogical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opinions, this time from Thommandel (don't know his/her real name).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that readers want a sentence by sentence deconstruction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that reply, but I could show how each sentence is based on nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than subjective opinion. Each collection of sentences, when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framed in any kind of logical form,  leads to an invalid 'conclusion'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reply has nothing to do with knowledge or information. These are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing more than subjective non-empirical and illogical opinions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; filled with pure speculation, with moving from 'some' to 'all', with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lots of 'perhaps' suggestions suddenly moving to 'always'; with false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; innuendoes,  with insertion of emotive fallacies - ad hominem, ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; populam,...and....false data, false links, sentences following each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other without any valid logical or empirical relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again - what does this type of post have to do with the scientific,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational examination of information? I could use these posts for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students to take apart in my critical thinking and logic classes -

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but - what are they doing on this list?
