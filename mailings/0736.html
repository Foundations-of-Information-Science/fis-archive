<p>
Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is an invitation to speak on the relation between the logic 
<br />
and the illogical which in their ensemble would make up the world.
<br />
<p>I wonder what the FIS agenda is thought to be by anyone who assumes logic 
<br />
is somehow embedded in the mechanics of the universe. (from Ted)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<p>We distinguish our logical thought-based processes against the other ways 
<br />
of functioning of our nervous system. We agree that a child (a newborn) 
<br />
does not think logically, that one s logic leaves one in times of great 
<br />
emotional stress, and that chemical imbalances of the brain /e.g. drugs, 
<br />
intoxications/ affect our capacities for logical thoughts.
<br />
<p>That is, what we denote as logic is a specific result of a specific way of 
<br />
functioning of a human brain. (It is also in some circumstances 
<br />
understandable when one speaks about an animal's behaviour as being 
<br />
logical, that is, in itself reasonable.)
<br />
<p>Let me propose that we designate the patterns of electrical discharges of 
<br />
the brain (the so-called thought processes) as logical. But the brain's 
<br />
electrical processes are without question embedded in the brains overall 
<br />
bio-chemical (osmotic, ionic, metabolic, hormonal...) processes. In a 
<br />
well-functioning brain, the two interact with each other. One's nutrition 
<br />
influences one's sanity as a thinking individual, and one's ways of 
<br />
thinking influence the health of one as a biologic sanitas /health/ as a body.
<br />
<p>My proposition is that FIS investigates the intimate relationships between 
<br />
what we think and what we feel on one hand, and what we feel and what we 
<br />
think on the other hand.
<br />
<p>In what cases is what we think a result of how we have fed or slept or 
<br />
breathed, and in what cases is what we eat or sleep or breathe a result of 
<br />
what we think? Is there an interrelation between the electrical discharges 
<br />
of the brain and the osmotic, metabolic, hormonal, chemical processes of 
<br />
the same brain?
<br />
<p>If so, what assembly is more mighty? (I have chosen the word mighty in full 
<br />
use of its several meanings).
<br />
The thinking subsystem monopolizes in the scientific discourse the access 
<br />
to the verbal center (the speech apparatus) and introduces itself as the 
<br />
real, rational, logical, only valid person speaking. The feeling subsystem 
<br />
does not come into contact with the microphone apparently (but for some 
<br />
notable  exceptions: tone and rhythm of speech, emotional utterances...)
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Karl
<br />
