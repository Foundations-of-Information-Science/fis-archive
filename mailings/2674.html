<p>
Jerry,
<br />
<p>You said:
<br />
<p>&quot;Living systems are natural.  Conceptual words such as analog and  
<br />
digital are artifacts of human cultural history.  Written symbol  
<br />
systems need grammars so that we can communicate with one another.   
<br />
Closure over symbol systems and &quot;colonies&quot; of statements are  
<br />
necessary and or essential for logical expressions in written symbol  
<br />
systems.  Your paragraph appears to me to conflate many concepts in  
<br />
such a way as to exclude nature from herself!&quot;
<br />
<p>What does this mean?  Seems like a lot of words to me.  Really, I  
<br />
hope you never have to &quot;conflate&quot; any of your words and concepts and  
<br />
dismiss them as &quot;artifacts of human cultural history.&quot;  Indeed our  
<br />
analytical minds are &quot;artifacts of human cultural history.&quot;  Are they  
<br />
not?
<br />
<p>You seem opposed to my asking questions about principles that would  
<br />
explain the appearance and evolution of biological information, as I  
<br />
see it—that is, expressly genetic information.  You would prefer  
<br />
instead to account for metabolic dynamics—&quot;flows of changes in  
<br />
chemical relations.&quot;  Suppose I were to say to this:  What?   
<br />
&quot;Chemical relations&quot;?  I didn't know chemicals had relations.  You  
<br />
see, this gets us nowhere.  Just words.
<br />
<p>And what do you mean by this statement?
<br />
<p>&quot;Your philosophy of mathematics appears to be based in I have no idea  
<br />
what.&quot;
<br />
<p>What if I said your 'philosophy of biological evolution appears to be  
<br />
based in I have no idea what'?  All you are saying is that I should  
<br />
chant your mantras and use your words.
<br />
<p>And you also said:
<br />
<p>&quot;I have no idea why nature &quot;ought&quot; to follow your principles.  Nature  
<br />
is what nature does.  So what?
<br />
&quot;First principles&quot; is a theological concept, is it not?
<br />
<p>Words...digital ones, too.
<br />
<p>&quot;The order of the list of the chemical elements apparently proceeded  
<br />
the man's expression of order by several billion years. From my  
<br />
perspective, you are putting the cart before the horse.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;Cart before the horse,&quot; is a metaphor, is it not?  Words...
<br />
<p>Your mantras are analogous; mine are both analogs and digits.  I say  
<br />
that more than analogs, chemical or otherwise, are involved with  
<br />
biological evolution.  There is a clear role for digital symbolism.   
<br />
Because genes are not stereochemical with respect with the proteins  
<br />
they build, or even with most of the amino acids they use to build  
<br />
them, I need more than just chemical analogs to see what goes on in  
<br />
biological evolution.  If you say that analogs and digits are only  
<br />
artifacts of our cultural human history, then I would have ask what  
<br />
isn't?  Even the language we use to communicate our conflated  
<br />
opinions are &quot;artifacts of human cultural history.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;If one wishes multiple universes, one first has to cope with the  
<br />
intrinsic mis-use of the usual definition of the noun &quot;universe&quot;.   
<br />
Personally, I would only resort to such an argument if it was the  
<br />
only possibility and even then I would not use it!&quot;
<br />
<p>Words...  Maybe &quot;universe&quot; is verb.
<br />
<p>My main question remains:  How did a digitally &quot;symbolic&quot; genetic  
<br />
system arise in cells to communicate and regulate the affairs of  
<br />
their chemical analogs?  I know of no principles in chemistry,  
<br />
physics, or biology that account for such an interesting convention.   
<br />
I don't have very much trouble imagining how the chemical analogs of,  
<br />
say, the Kreb's cycle might have evolved. Chemicals can be  
<br />
marvelously stereochemical, you know. Conversely, I don't have a  
<br />
single clue as to how the genetic Dictionary evolved—a profoundly  
<br />
digital construction.  Those chemical analogs are only perfunctory  
<br />
nucleotides; it is their linear order that makes ALL the difference.
<br />
<p>Regards, Richard

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I read your post, you seem to be involved with an internal

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; By what principle does this emergent property you describe adopt a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; property I would have to agree to a few brave assumptions.  One  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be that biological systems, comprising hierarchical atoms  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and molecules, are just naturally capable of writing their own

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; operational programs.  That's a reach for me, because nothing is

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explained.  Even though I am aware that organisms do exactly that,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there are no principles I know of to support it.  HOW they do it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (not WHY they do it) is the key issue for me.  How do analogs  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; write their own digital scripts?  One again, the only other time  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in natural history that I know of this sort of thing happening was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; when human analogs wrote their own digitally symbolic language  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about 10,000 years ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Living systems are natural.  Conceptual words such as analog and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As Stan has said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, the origin of the genetic system is arguably the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; outstanding problem facing natural science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  And you go on to say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus, if one wishes to develop a compelling argument about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; chemical numbers and structures and genetic information,  one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; should start with relational algebras that keep track of changes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of relations... A living system is a society of associative  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; relations among atomic numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If an emergent property truly emerges in nature I think it ought  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to do so on first principles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no idea why nature &quot;ought&quot; to follow your principles.   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nature is what nature does.  So what?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Still, to argue that &quot;biological information emerges as flows of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; changes...&quot; interests me. Seems a little like a DC electrical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system—something new for me to worry about.  But how did those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; upstart crystalline micelles, containing numerical/chemical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relations, learn algebra well enough to enable the emergence of a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; genetic code?  How did such a uniquely non-analogous language for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communicating pure digital information in biological systems come  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into existence?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your philosophy of mathematics appears to be based in I have no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea what.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you expect chemical atoms and molecules to follow your vision of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maybe this emergent property cannot be explained in hierarchical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms applying to a single universe.  Maybe the emergent property  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Jerry speaks of is evidence of another universe, a coincidental  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one, where digits rule and analogs are the exception. Yes, it's a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wild idea.  But I don't think there is enough hierarchy in this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pedestrian universe of ours to get us the principles we need to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain what biological life actually is and where it came from.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
