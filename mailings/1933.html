Dear Sir/madam,
<br />
<p>I am barrister John Zuma, solicitor and notary public, the personal attorney to Mr. Mark  GERALD. On the 26th of May 2002, my client his wife and two daughters were involved in a car accident along Pretoria express road South Africa. Unfortunately they lost their lives in the event of the accident.
<br />
<p>I am writing this letter to solicit your cooperation in order to redeem an investment interest currently being held under trust with the South Africa ministry of Energy and Mineral resources. The said investment now valued at (10.5million United States dollars) was originally purchased by my late client leased to the Free Estate Consolidated Corporation in 1999 for (4) years.
<br />
<p>The duration for this lease has long matured and I have been contacted by the company to produce my client's next of kin to file in application for claims. Hence, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the decease . These funds could be confiscated if I do not present his next of kin within a short time given.
<br />
<p>I could file a claim for this money to this ministry claiming that you are the next of kin to my late client, Mr. Mark G. as the beneficiary and next of kin to the funds. As soon as the claims is approved the stated sum will be transferred into any account of your choice after which I shall travel to meet with you to discuss investment plans.
<br />
<p>I now seek your permission to have you stand as the next of kin to my client, all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the release of this fund in your favor, please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information;
<br />
<p>1. Your name and address
<br />
<p>2. Direct telephone/mobile and fax numbers
<br />
<p>This informations will enable me file in a letter of claims to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor, before the transfer can be affected. 
<br />
<p>We would reserve 50% of the funds for Charity purposes and the balance 50% will be shared between us on a final conclusion of this project. Please do not take undue advantage of this trust I have bestowed in you.
<br />
<p>Please reply me through the email address below, if you are interested, but if you are not it will enable me scout for another foreign Partner.
<br />
<p>Regards,
<br />
<p><p><p>John Zuma (Barrister at Law)
