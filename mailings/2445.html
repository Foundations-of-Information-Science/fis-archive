<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel Petitjean posted  a few fundamental questions about QI, its
<br />
applications and its distinguishing features comparing with classical
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>Michel:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Physical:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Apart for electrons, does the QI model is indeed assumed to work for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any particle or system of particles ?
</em><br />
<p>Andrei: In principle, yes! You could do QI with heavy particles, e.g.,
<br />
neutrons. The only restriction to a system is that it should be
<br />
\&quot;quantum\&quot;. What does it mean? This is the well known problemn of quantum
<br />
foundations. At the beginning it was assumed (at least by the 
<br />
Copenhagen interpretation) that \&quot;quantum\&quot;=\&quot;micro\&quot;. Such an agreement was
<br />
convenient to exclude such quantum paradoxes, as so called Schrodinger 
<br />
cat paradox: a macroscopic system in a superposition of two different
<br />
states, Schrodinger produced a very natural example of microscopic
<br />
superposition which would produce cat in the superposition to be dead
<br />
and alive.
<br />
<p>Of course, the difficult question of such an interpretation of \&quot;quantum\&quot;
<br />
is to find the boundary between micro and macro. So if we increase the
<br />
mass of a particle, until which limit it would be still quantum?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Now days the identification \&quot;quantum\&quot;=\&quot;micro\&quot; is not more possible,
<br />
since there were observed in real experiments large collective systems,
<br />
Bose-Einstein condensate, which exhibit quantum behaviour. 
<br />
Thus in principle QI might be done even with macroscopic quantum systems.
<br />
However, I recall that for real applications even electrons are too
<br />
heavy. The real QI will work with photons, since it is easy to transmit
<br />
them. 
<br />
Coming back to the question: Which systems could be considered as
<br />
quantum?  I remark that one could try to define quantumness via a
<br />
special probabilistic behaviour of a system. The basic statistical test
<br />
for quantumness of probabilities is INTERFERENCE OF PROBABILITIES. It
<br />
can be found for example in the basic two slit experiment. 
<br />
<p>We can formulate the question about quantumness of macrosystems as the
<br />
question of intereference, see \&quot;On the notion of macroscopic quantum
<br />
system\&quot;, <a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0408164">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0408164</a>
<br />
<p>Michel:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Having two correlated r.v. X1 and X2, the observations of X1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provide informations about X1, but also about X2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What are the basic differences between this kind of correlation and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;\&quot;correlation\&quot; in the QI case ?
</em><br />
<p>Andrei: In fact, this basic EPR-example with correlated particles was
<br />
proposed by people, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, who would answer:
<br />
There is no any differences between this kind of correlation (namely,
<br />
usual classical) and the \&quot;correlation\&quot; in the QI case? For Einstein,
<br />
measurements on quantum correlated systems just exhibit correlation
<br />
which were present in the initial state. Nowdays it is commonly assumed 
<br />
(among physicists) taht Einstein was wrong. The reason for such a rather
<br />
common opinion is the violation of Bell\'s inequality for correlation for 
<br />
quantum particles. If one assume that some physical observables (for
<br />
example, projections of spin or polarizations of ligh)  can be
<br />
represented by classical random variables, then correlations SHOULD
<br />
satisfy Bell\'s inequality. However, if one make calculations for such
<br />
correlations by using quantum formalism, tehn this inequality is
<br />
violated! One of the possibilities is that QM  simply provides a wrong 
<br />
model for such experiments. However, teher were done experiments --
<br />
by Aspect and then by many others -- and it is commonly assumed that 
<br />
QM was correct. So the only possibility is to assume that correlations
<br />
are NONCLASSICAL.
<br />
<p>However, there are two problems with such an interpretation of
<br />
violations of Bell\'s inequality;
<br />
<p>a). Physical: Experiments were done for photons (even if in textbooks
<br />
people write about electrons, nobody was able to do anything with them).
<br />
There are huge losses of photons in those experiments. Roughly speaking
<br />
for each experiment (for fixed polarizations) we use only a special 
<br />
and very small part of the ensemble of pairs. This problem is known in
<br />
physics as the problem of efficiency of detectors. I do not know another 
<br />
experiment in any domain of science in that conclusions were based on
<br />
such a poor data, see <a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309010">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309010</a>
<br />
<p>b). Mathematical: It is not well known, but \&quot;Bell\'s inequality\&quot; was used
<br />
already by J. Boole (who invented Boolean algebras). He used this
<br />
inequality to check whether three random variables can be realized on
<br />
the same probability space. He used Boolean algebras, but now days we
<br />
can speak about Kolmogorov probability space. The Bell\'s inequality 
<br />
can be derived only under the assumption that there exists teh common
<br />
Kolmogorov probability space for all experimental settings in teh
<br />
EPR-experiment: in this inequality there is combined the data from three 
<br />
different experiments. This is  a very strong assumption. If you open
<br />
the original book of Kolmogorov on the modern probabilistic axiomatics,
<br />
he emphasized that each experimental context generates its own
<br />
probability space. In my book \&quot;Interpretations of Probability\&quot;, VSP Int.
<br />
Publ., Utrecht, 1999
<br />
(see also <a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006016">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006016</a>)
<br />
I explored this point of view and it is easy to see that Bell\'s
<br />
inequality can be violated for any context-dependent 
<br />
collection of measurements.
<br />
<p>Conclusion. Personally I am not sure that QI really differs
<br />
fundamentally from CI. I would say that it might be that QI is just a
<br />
special representation, \&quot;projection\&quot;, of CI. But if you like to follow
<br />
to the conventional views, you should say: \&quot;Experimental violation of
<br />
Bell\'s inequality demonstrated that QM produces nonclassical
<br />
correlations.\&quot;  
<br />
Michel:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Philosophical:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could we say that the entanglement of two particles reduces to the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that a measure done on the first particle indicates something on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;second particle just because they are interacting ?
</em><br />
Andrei: Einstein and I would say: yes! But the conventional viewpoin:
<br />
no! -- because the Bell inequality.
