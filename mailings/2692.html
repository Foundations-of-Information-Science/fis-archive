                <p>
                    Let me translate the main theses of Igor's and Loet's into concepts of
                    <br />
                    information
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>Igor:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Cognitive aspect of complexity in social
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; systems can have at least three distinct dimensions. One deals with the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; virtual impossibility for humans to gather all the available information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; and compute the optimal decision among the possible alternatives. In
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; literature this is usually called the problem of bounded rationality.
                    </em><br />
                <p>The scope of our sensory organs is limited. So we deduct from ourselves that
                    <br />
                    any system we conceptualise will have limits, beyond which it cannot reach.
                    <br />
                    There is a non-recognisable outside to any system of knowledge.
                    <br />
                <p>Igor:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Another dimension of complexity comes from the fact that human decision
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; making is not only bounded by technical constraints related to
                        information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; gathering and processing but is also significantly constrained by a bias
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; that comes from the set of basic values and beliefs about the world and
                        a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; society that a decision maker holds in his mind. In that sense certain
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; solutions to a problem, which are technically accessible and rational,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; perhaps even optimal for an external observer, are discarded or
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; unrecognized as such because they clash with certain socially shared
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; beliefs and values (a worldview).
                    </em><br />
                <p>There is a background to that what we recognise. The properties of the
                    <br />
                    background is that what we do not see. Wittgenstein has drawn an eye and said
                    <br />
                    that the eye cannot see itself.
                    <br />
                    The preconceptions that we use restrict that what we can recognise.

                <p>Igor:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The third dimension might refer to self-referentiallity of human

                    </em><br />

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; functioning which in turn may alter this very functioning. The outcome

                        and

                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; what is its &quot;societal&quot; interpretation?
                    </em><br />
                <p>The only minor point to raise is the insertion of &quot;practically almost&quot; before
                    <br />
                    &quot;... unpredictable and may be recognised...&quot;.
                    <br />
                    In theory, every state of a closed logical system can be predicted. In
                    <br />
                    reality,
                    <br />
                    we work overtime to understand the extreme unpredictability of e.g. the
                    <br />
                    weather
                    <br />
                    and genetic variations/mutations. If we believed that the behaviour of complex
                    <br />
                    systems cannot be brought into a pattern of linear predictions (if now this,
                    <br />
                    then then that), we could not keep on doing science.
                    <br />
                    That human behaviour is partly more complex than a weather system is only a
                    <br />
                    gradual difference, and in many cases, a weather system is less predictable
                    <br />
                    than a human.

                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; There appears simply to be more degrees of freedom in a social system

                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; are also qualitatively different from ecological.
                    </em><br />
                <p>If one transposes the behaviour of complex systems into stability, uniformity
                    <br />
                    and diversity properties of a set filled up with symbols and then left to its
                    <br />
                    own devices, the resulting decision paths will depict it quite deeply. The
                    <br />
                    model is equally suitable for social, ecological, meteorological, biochemical
                    <br />
                    and economical applications. From the interregulation aspect, these are all
                    <br />
                    homeostatic or quasi-homeostatic systems, where the linear distance between
                    <br />
                    two
                    <br />
                    states (in a linear enumeration) will allow predictions about the composition
                    <br />
                    of symbols (then/there) based on the composition of symbols (now/here). The
                    <br />
                    statistics of large assemblies shows that they utilise a quite slight
                    <br />
                    imbalance
                    <br />
                    between the counting systems. The imbalance does not show when we regard each
                    <br />
                    and every object in its turn, its shows only if we assign symbols to more than
                    <br />
                    32 objects... as I have argued so often in this list, it appears that large
                    <br />
                    assemblies
                    <br />
                    of objects that have symbols obey their own laws, which are based
                    <br />
                    on the existence of the inexactitude between the counting systems.
                    <br />
                    So, in this view, human systems do not differ qualitatively from any other
                    <br />
                    kind
                    <br />
                    of complex systems which are homeostatic.
                    <br />
                    Focusing on perceived differences will keep motivating us to recognise
                    <br />
                    similarities and rules that work on complex systems. A social system is a self-
                    <br />
                    regulating, cybernetical entity. It lives. So it can be described by rational
                    <br />
                    means.
