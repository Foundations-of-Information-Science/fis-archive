<p>
In response to Christophe Menant's post, , I'd say that not all 
<br />
components of a signal are 'information'. Rather, the signal begins 
<br />
as 'data' from X-entity, which can be, if received by Y-entity, 
<br />
transformed to information via Y's MGS system. [Actually, I think 
<br />
that this transformation requires an interaction of BOTH system's 
<br />
MGS systems. Not just one.]
<br />
<p>The MGS system, as a system-of-constraints, is quite similar to 
<br />
Peircean Thirdness, the normative habits of a community (whether 
<br />
abiotic, biotic species or human etc). And therefore, similar to what 
<br />
Aristotle had in mind with 'Form'. This system does act as a 
<br />
formative constraint. Therefore, the process-of-meaning, is triadic. 
<br />
Sensual data doesn't move directly to interpretated information. 
<br />
Rather, it reaches that 'informed state' by being transformed via the 
<br />
mediate constraints. 
<br />
<p>Data which is unprocessed by that mediate system 
<br />
(MGS/THIRDNESS etc) will be random and without meaning. It will 
<br />
be picked up, I feel, by some other system and transformed to 
<br />
information. 
<br />
<p>This mediate process, as Christophe points out, should not be 
<br />
viewed within a perspective aligning it with the human psyche. As 
<br />
for the intentionality of the constraints (to survive, as Christophe 
<br />
points out), I'm less certain of that for again, that inserts psyche. I 
<br />
suggest a more elementary intentionality. It's for the survival of 
<br />
energy. Energy can only exist as mass. And mass operating only 
<br />
as random formations is non-productive. Therefore, constraints 
<br />
develop that produce processes of the transformation of energy to 
<br />
mass in a stable and productive manner. This ensures the 
<br />
continuity of energy on our planet. The constraint mediate system 
<br />
becomes more complex, ensuring greater stability (and at the 
<br />
same time - this increased complexity makes the processes 
<br />
happen faster). Now- can one then focus on one particular 
<br />
constraint system (ie, a particular species' DNA code) and say that 
<br />
its intention is for the continuity of the individual? Or even the 
<br />
species?) I think it's more basic. It's the continuity of the 
<br />
transformation of energy to mass. And how that continuity is 
<br />
achieved (ie which species' code)...is not that important.
