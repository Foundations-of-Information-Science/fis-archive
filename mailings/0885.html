Dear FISers
<br />
<p>Greetings to all for the new year. Sorry I am so late in the response to 
<br />
Jim, Shu-Kun and Jerry, lumped here following with the general reflections 
<br />
started byTed, but the vacations and an inopportune flu have kept me out of 
<br />
game.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That in the world through which one, perceiving the world, arrives at his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conception of the world, that, in the order of the Blessed One, is called 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the world...
</em><br />
<p>It strongly reminds me the comments that our colleague Otto Rossler made in 
<br />
his May 25 1998 message on consciousness (see our mail archive in the web: 
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/default.htm">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/</a>)... &quot;Chuang-Tzu called it 'the 
<br />
water'. The fish are unable to see it and talk about it, he claimed&quot;...  In 
<br />
my own opinion, going into the language of physics, it would be 'the field'.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If one or two of you would be willing to comment briefly upon the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quotation within this forum, I would be much obliged.  Your comments would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be of great value in furthering my own research.  If you are curious I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will try to encapsulate my project in a few JPEG files that can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attached to a future mailing.
</em><br />
<p>Yes please, send them. But given that posting files into the list is highly 
<br />
unwelcome (policy rules) send your JPEG files to Rey Abe at 
<br />
fisadmin&#64;igw.tuwien.ac.at , so that he will insert them into our web pages 
<br />
and we will able to watch them there.
<br />
<p>----------------
<br />
It is curious the coincidence in time between Jim's posting and Shu-Kun's 
<br />
posting about entropy and Leyton's stuff. Months ago, Jim had introduced 
<br />
Michael Leyton into our discussion scope, and it is really interesting the 
<br />
congruence recently found between the generative approach to form by ML and 
<br />
the new approach to molecular similarity championed by SK. The very brief 
<br />
point I want to make, relating to Jerry and Ted comments, is that we need a 
<br />
new approach to info where this concept gets its own path, separated from 
<br />
group theory and the conceptualization of symmetry and entropy. Actually 
<br />
info becomes a 'leftover' in current symmetry approaches, while in the new 
<br />
view based on set theory (Karl's partitions?), symmetry would appear as a 
<br />
leftover and 'distinction' should remain as the atomic or minimalist 
<br />
logical basis of the new system of thought. Indeed at the time being we 
<br />
should find chances to collectively explore this  'other side of the 
<br />
mirror' with respect to symmetry &amp; group theory.
<br />
<p>Probably I have encapsulated too briefly (and rather uglily) the idea, but 
<br />
I think we should struggle to open a new conceptual 'info' approach to 
<br />
symmetry-entropy, organization, etc. Then a new vision of life would 
<br />
progressively appear: of chemical-cellular nature as Jerry suggests, but 
<br />
also of organismic and economic 'info natures'. And of course, we would 
<br />
also be able to continue the very interesting philo discussion of these 
<br />
days... perhaps trying to find new bottles for the new wine.
<br />
<p><p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
