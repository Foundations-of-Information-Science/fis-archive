Dear FIS-ers:
<br />
<p>I refer to James Barnham's response to Pedro and Gyorgy, as quoted by Mark
<br />
Burgin on May 17, and to the contradiction pointed out by the latter.
<br />
<p>Barnham writes:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;we must always be careful to distinguish the epistemic and ontic planes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when thinking about life and information, and realize that our knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the cell is one thing, and the cell's own existence is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else.
</em><br />
<p>I agree fully, as long as we do the same for the physical world, and add
<br />
to the above: &quot;Our knowledge about the physical world is one thing, and
<br />
the physical world's own existence is something else. In the first,
<br />
information appears through OUR interactions with the physical world--in
<br />
the second, information plays no role 'in its own right' &quot; .
<br />
<p>I fully agree with the summary statement given in that same response: 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; while in the subjective, extrinsic, observer-dependent sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all structure can be considered information---for us, as observers---in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the objective, intrinsic, observer-independent sense, there simply was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no information at all before the origin of life, because there were no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems yet able to enter into the right sort of dynamical interactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are in fact constitutive of information-use.
</em><br />
<p>Concerning Mark Burgin's noted &quot;contradiction (&quot;There is no information
<br />
where there is no life, hence Life cannot exist!&quot;), I'd like to convince
<br />
you that there is no contradiction at all! To do that, let me bring up
<br />
something I did not see mentioned too often in the FIS discussion so far:
<br />
EVOLUTION. 
<br />
<p>Indeed, as I state on several occasions in my paper (see the end of
<br />
section 4), information and life should have emerged together in the
<br />
course of evolution. In other words, life did not emerge DUE to
<br />
information processes, but WITH information processes. No doubt, there was
<br />
a prebiotic &quot;transition period&quot; in which (and I quote from my paper)
<br />
&quot;...large and complex polymer-like macromolecules emerged as code-carrying
<br />
templates whose effect on other molecules in their environment is to bind
<br />
them through a catalytic process into conglomerates according to patterns
<br />
represented by the code. Some of these polymers also served as templates
<br />
for the production of others like themselves--those more efficient in this
<br />
process would multiply....Concerning these macromolecules, we can say that
<br />
beyond a certain degree of complexity, information as such begins to play
<br />
the decisive role in organizing the chemical environment. Because of the
<br />
role of information as the controlling agent, these molecules can trigger
<br />
chemical reactions that would be highly improbable to occur naturally
<br />
under the same environmental conditions and energy sources...&quot;.
<br />
<p>Concerning a later stage in the evolution of life and the question of
<br />
&quot;information stored in the genetic structures of an organism&quot;, I state in
<br />
my paper &quot;...the information content is not derived from physical laws and
<br />
deliberately stored, but ... emerges gradually in the course of a long
<br />
Darwinian process of selective adaptation. It could be called an
<br />
&quot;unreflected learning process by trial and error&quot;... in which ... the
<br />
prearranged accord between sender and recipient--an essential part of
<br />
information-based interactions--comes into existence. There is no
<br />
pre-existing information or purpose in adaptive evolution--the latter just
<br />
happens if the circumstances are right.&quot;
<br />
<p>And in Earth's environment, they were right!
