(1) Replying to Bob's below:  Yes, I was specifically referring to human
<br />
mentality in my comments.  I do agree with Bateson, and, using again the
<br />
specification hierarchy, I would see {cybernetic mentality {social
<br />
mentality {human linguistic metality}}}.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I think it possible to suggest that there could not be minds, as we

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that is the case, then:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stan, This was not Gregory Bateson's take when he wrote &quot;An Ecology of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mind&quot;.  Bateson saw &quot;mind&quot; present anywhere one had cybernetic memory. He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;viewed human mentation as a limiting form of the more generally ubiquitous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mind&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then again, his is not what we &quot;spontaneously&quot; think of in response to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;word &quot;mind&quot;. :)
</em><br />
<p>(2) Replying to Igor's below:  As a semiotician, I devise a theoretical
<br />
picture of the construction of meaning as a diagram.  This diagram is
<br />
generalized from our understanding of the operation among our own human
<br />
minds of processes of induction, deduction, abduction, implication,
<br />
imputation, and so on.  (I can send a copy of this diagram to anyone
<br />
desiring to see it.)  Once we have such a diagram we see that its
<br />
categories are general enough to possibly be applied to other than human
<br />
mental process.  Any system that has enough degrees of freedom related in
<br />
approximately the same way as the abstractions in the diagram can now be
<br />
imputed to be a semiotic system.  In this way we can construct a
<br />
pansemiotics.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Dear colleagues,    Something is certainly lost in translation. Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there a meaning outside the  mind? Is it not that WE create a meaning in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the process of discourse?    If yes, then in the chemical (or any other)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hierarchies there are no  meanings, but a possibility of a meaning, should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an appropriate mind come  nearby.    If not, then we need to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning before we  start discussing such involved questions.    Maybe my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;education is not enough to perceive the  subtleties, but I think that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unable to understand, whether meaning is  preserved or not before I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;receive a clear definition of meaning.    Otherwise it is too vague, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we may as well do a  very simple trick.    Just find something that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preserved in chemical  hierarchies, and then call it meaning :))))))
</em><br />
<p>(3) Jamie said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Meaning arises in situations of purposeful APPLICATION.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And -that- does not require ... 'mind'.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is such situations that are modeled in the above mentioned diagram
<br />
of semiosis.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you want to restrict the definiiton of 'meaning'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to human pertinence only, then of course 'mind' would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a present component and a likely 'requisite', but,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in generalist standing, 'mind' is not required for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'meaning'.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right -- {meaning as a set of semiotic relations {human understanding}}.
<br />
<p>(4) Pedro said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The evolutionary approach to &quot;meaning&quot; could get interesting yields too,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;properly starting with the cellular underpinnings, within molecular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bionetworks themselves. Let me try a brief preamble. Ab initio, perhaps it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is necessary distinguishing between perturbation, signaling and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication. The open system of the cell may be perturbed by quite many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instances---but not meaningfully. We may talk about meaning only when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perturbing event is a &quot;signal&quot; , so to speak &quot;abduced&quot; from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environment  (recognized as such by devoted receptors) following genomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wisdom guideliness, and implying a closure of events regarding survival and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reproduction within the niche. Thereafter  &quot;communication&quot; belongs to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exchange of signals and responses between living partners involving well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;established sequences and protocols (for instance, already in bacteria:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbiotic events, colonies, differentiation, collective motion, predation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc.) also with overall adaptive closure.
</em><br />
<p>This is a good view of biosemiotics.  I think there is a possible problem
<br />
here involving &quot;well established sequences and protocols&quot; in that there
<br />
could be a danger that these are (or can become) merely arbitrary -- the
<br />
products of evolution discourse.  The reason is that the environment, in
<br />
any of its innumerable facets, could change significantly enough so that
<br />
some of the protocols no longer can relate to it effectively.  There is the
<br />
principle in neoDarwinism a view emphasizing a 'continual deterioration of
<br />
the environment' -- 'deterioration' being any change whatever from the
<br />
expectations of living systems.  This must be 'continual' because there are
<br />
so many facets of an environment.  It is supposed that various kinds of
<br />
mutations of successful living systems happen at a rate commensurate with
<br />
the average rate of change of environment.  One line of thinking within
<br />
neoDarwinism emphasizes this relationship, so that a population is viewed
<br />
as simply trying to keep up with environmental change -- just trying to'
<br />
stay in the game'.  This line of thinking conflicts with another
<br />
neoDarwinian tradition that emphasizes the process of adaptation -- that
<br />
is, the process of evolving these &quot;established sequences and protocols&quot;.
<br />
These two lines of thought have not been resolved into one theory.
