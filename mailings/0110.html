Dear all,
<br />
<p>Gunter Dubrau (Univ. of Dresden) asked me to give him (you) some more 
<br />
details concerning Weizsaecker's information concept. Here are some 
<br />
of the texts (in the German version)
<br />
1) &quot;Sprache als Information&quot; (Language as information) is a text 
<br />
published in 1959 in a book with the title: Die Einheit der Natur 
<br />
(the unity of nature). W(eiszsaecker) refers here for the first time 
<br />
(?) to the relationship of information to the concept of form (idea) 
<br />
in Platon and Aristotle and in Biology
<br />
2) &quot;Materie, Energie, Information&quot; (Matter, Energy, Information) 969: 
<br />
a text also published in the book:TheUnity of Nature. Here you find 
<br />
the double definition of information:
<br />
information is only what can be understood (W. speaks about 
<br />
&quot;objectivized semantics&quot;)
<br />
information is only what produces information.
<br />
W. asks about the amount of form of an organisms. This can be 
<br />
answered in two ways:
<br />
- information is a big number (DNS-&quot;types&quot; x (multiplied) proteins X 
<br />
cells)
<br />
- information is exactly 2n (i.e. the species or the DNS of the nucleus 
<br />
of any cell)
<br />
in the first case you loose the possibility of understanding, in the 
<br />
second the individual information
<br />
in short: the 'eidos' (or form) belongs to the thing as well as to 
<br />
the 'soul' (but, only the 'soul' can grasp it as such...)
<br />
3) &quot;Information and Imagination&quot; (this is  a &quot;popular&quot; paper 
<br />
published in 1973, with connections to art...)
<br />
4) &quot;Der Garten des Menschlichen&quot; (1977) this is W. philosophical 
<br />
antropology. You can find here the idea that information is related 
<br />
to a receiver (organ or instrument) i.e. &quot;under a concept&quot; ( the word 
<br />
concept refers here to any structure, not only to consciousness)
<br />
5) &quot;Aufbau der Physik&quot; (1981) (The Structure of Physics). This is a 
<br />
comprehensive book on physics, where W. refers to the concept of 
<br />
information as developed in 1969 (Mater, Energy, I.). He relates the 
<br />
concept of &quot;decisions&quot; as belonging to the determination of form (the 
<br />
number of decisions related to the form of an object), 
<br />
&quot;understanding&quot; is a concept used now not only to designate a 
<br />
conscious process, but an objective effect on a living being or a 
<br />
machine. Matter has a form, consciousness recognizes it, matter is a 
<br />
way a form shines (comes forth)... etc. the whole chapter is full of 
<br />
ideas and end with the question of time as horizon of being (in 
<br />
response to some ideas by the philosopher Georg Picht).
<br />
6) &quot;Wahrnehmung der Neuzeit&quot; (1983) (Perception of Modernity): here you can find some hints on 
<br />
evolution and the concept of an objective information concept.
<br />
7) &quot;Der Mensch und seine Geschichte&quot; (Humanity and its  history) 
<br />
(1991) where W. refers to the eidos-philosophy of Plato's Timaios.
<br />
8) &quot;Zeit und Wissen&quot; (Time and Knowledge) (1992) a very comprehensive 
<br />
book, where W. refers to &quot;Matter, Energy and I.&quot; (1969) as well as to 
<br />
&quot;Aufbau der Physik&quot; (1981). He asks: What does Form/Gestalt mean in 
<br />
Physics? What is the relationship between Form and Time? and to 
<br />
consciousness? and between Time and Knowledge? do we come back to 
<br />
eidos-philosophy (Plato)?
<br />
<p>Well this is very short what I can tell you about W.'s concept(s) of 
<br />
information. You will surely find many relations to our present 
<br />
discussions (think for instance the problems of information and time 
<br />
(and consciousness) as raised by Koichiro (and others). We should not 
<br />
forget, that we had this century a strong questioning (by philosphers 
<br />
such as Karl Popper) of &quot;essences&quot;. But this should not mislead us to
<br />
through away the question itself (in German: das Kind mit dem Bade 
<br />
aussch|tten: to through out the baby with the bath-water). Of course 
<br />
we (?)  are not any &quot;essential&quot; thinkers in the sense of timeless 
<br />
(and divine) essences. But we cannot do even a small step in thinking 
<br />
without having any kind of &quot;forms&quot; in mind, don't you think?
<br />
Your question concerning W. and Kant: you will find several hints to 
<br />
Kant in W.'s writings. Kant's philosophy (which is a kind of 
<br />
constructivism) rests upon the idea that the forms 'a priori' in our 
<br />
cognition are 'the condition of possibility' of the (forms of the) 
<br />
things we grasp (not of the things themselves, as we are not their 
<br />
creators...)
<br />
You ask if I know some practical applications of considerations 
<br />
coming from information science. Well as far as I can see Shannon 
<br />
and Weaver is part of this story, but also the new paradigm of 
<br />
biology 'you' are trying to introduce by changing the language of 
<br />
biology introducing new concepts, analogies, metaphors etc.
<br />
kind regards
<br />
rafael
