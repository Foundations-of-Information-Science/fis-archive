<p>ERHC and ExxonMobil exercise priority rights on highly sought after oil blocks 
  in <br>
  Nigeria and Sao Tome's Joint Development Zone (JDZ) in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>Every major newswire service worldwide has carried hundreds of articles revealing 
  that <br>
  the offshore oil blocks in this region contain 10 to 15 Billion Barrels of Oil. 
  The JDZ <br>
  line-up tipped to take over upcoming blocks includes ExxonMobil, ERHC, <br>
  ChevronTexaco, AmeradaHess, and Anadarko.</p>
<p>License approval for the region's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a multilateral 
  deal <br>
  securing blocks jointly involving ExxonMobil, ERHC, and ChevronTexaco.</p>
<p>ERHC has jumped from a .25 cent stock earlier in the year to a .50 cent stock 
  that is <br>
  headed for over $2 or a possible buyout from one of their JDZ multinational 
  players.</p>
<p>ERHC has been at the negotiating tables with the super-major oil companies. 
  It is <br>
  impossible to measure the power that is carried where a stock at this price 
  level is a <br>
  vital part of a key union of oil giants! The top-level executives of the JDZ 
  oil majors <br>
  have been finalizing the percentage awards with ERHC for official announcement 
  of the <br>
  landmark-licensing round in the first 2 weeks of June.</p>
<p>The US Government is pushing for increasing development of the area to minimize 
  <br>
  Middle East dependence. The eyes of the world are watching with record prices 
  at the <br>
  pump and oil busting through $40 per barrel.</p>
<p>The oil companies will always make their $Billions - investors can cash in 
  by <br>
  accumulating a substantial position just before earth-shattering news is released 
  that <br>
  will send shockwaves through ERHC.</p>
<p>Required Disclosure: Stock Buyer's Alert (SBA) cautions that small and micro-cap 
  <br>
