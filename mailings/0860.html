--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>dear christophe, thank you for the comments.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Wolfgang,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here are some points your article brings up that I would like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to comment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Presentation of &quot;information&quot; as a super concept that deserves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being subdivised into relevant particular concepts is an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way to addres the subject, as it is true that &quot;information&quot; per se
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addresses an immense field of events.
</em><br />
<p>well, to some degree it may be a kind of a terminological problem which one 
<br />
of the related and cognate concepts is fixed in order to play the role of 
<br />
the generic one. but what i want to capture by that is that there ought to 
<br />
be a relationship between the concepts like the relationship between 
<br />
something more general, universal, and something more specific, particular. 
<br />
e.g., i think it makes sense to characterise knowledge as information with 
<br />
certain concrete traits.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your next point is to propose three fields: Cognition (content of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness), communication (common understanding),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cooperation (sense embodied in social structures).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A comment would be about the entry point you choose (in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of complexity) to introduce the concept of information: the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of human (cognition).
</em><br />
<p>yes, at the first glance, it is the level of human systems/ social systems 
<br />
where to find three fields of information processes. at a second glance, 
<br />
however, three fields like the ones mentioned seem to be characteristic of 
<br />
any systems. that is, in the systems perspective, you can focus on the 
<br />
intrasystemic field (the interior of a system) or on the intersystemic 
<br />
field (the field inbetween of systems) or on the suprasystemic field (the 
<br />
supersystem which is made up by the systems in question). (this 
<br />
categorisation, by the way, is due to the metasystem transition 
<br />
evolutionary systems undergo - an initial phase of, so to say, solitary 
<br />
systems, an intermediate phase of interacting systems and a phase of 
<br />
integration of the systems with a higher order system.) investigating into 
<br />
information processes in the first field is dealing with cognition, given 
<br />
human systems, and it is dealing with similar processes (soemthing like 
<br />
precognition) on the prehuman level. in the second field it is 
<br />
communicative processes on the human and something like precommunication on 
<br />
the prehuman level. and information processing for co-operation on the 
<br />
human level in the third field, while something like pre-co-operative 
<br />
processes on the prehuman level.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I feel one can take information as beginning to exist at the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of basic life (lower organization level than human), or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the level of matter (see Edwina's approach relative to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;informed matter&quot;). But later, in your &quot;unifying perspective&quot;,  you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reword this entry point as &quot;self organizing systems cognizing their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;umwelt&quot;. This wording can be looked at as containing basic life (but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not matter). Could you provide more precision about your entry point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for information concept introduction ?
</em><br />
<p>ok. i side with edwina in this point. i do not identify the beginning of 
<br />
information processes with the beginning of life but with the beginning of 
<br />
self-organisation instead. the big divide between systems that show 
<br />
information processes and those that don't is whether they are capable of 
<br />
organising themselves or not. systems that do not self-organise do not 
<br />
manifest information generacy. only self-organising systems are able to 
<br />
generate information. the most simple unit that shows information 
<br />
generation is the most rudimentary, the primordial self-organising system. 
<br />
this is clearly in the physical realm, long before and below living 
<br />
systems. it is my conviction that there you will be able to identify 
<br />
rudiments of cognizability, of communicability and of co-operability as to 
<br />
the three fields mentioned above. maybe my wording in the table is not 
<br />
exact and should read &quot;cognising resp. precognising&quot;.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, you write that &quot;properties of information in non human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;domains are usually extrapolated from properties of information in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human domain&quot;. I agree with this statement as being a fact, but do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really understand the rational behind it.
</em><br />
<p>that's a misunderstanding. i do not advocate anthropomorphic 
<br />
extrapolations. i warn against doing so.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, I feel that information really exists, and is to be considered, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;levels of organization lower that human. And extrapolating to non human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cases the properties of information as understod for human is a bit risky.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This because the level of human posseses specific performances (reflected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness, highly developped domain of emotions) that are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;currently extrapolatable to non human cases.
</em><br />
<p>sure, i absolutely agree. i try to favour a perspective that goes beyond 
<br />
capurro's trilemma as well as beyond snow's two cultures. that is, i argue 
<br />
against extrapolationism as well as reductionism.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And anthropocentrism may be misleading (one could prefer an evolutionist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach starting from a well understood position at basic life level, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then climbing up the ladder of complexity. Understanding that the nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of human is still to be explained in scientific terms).
</em><br />
<p>yes, in my opinion evolutionary systems thinking understood dialectically 
<br />
promises to be the remedy. it tries hard neither to extrapolate qualities 
<br />
appearing in a later stage of evolution onto earlier stages nor to reduce 
<br />
qualities appearing in a later stage to qualities appearing in an earlier 
<br />
stage. it looks upon evolution as a &quot;discontinuous continuum&quot;. that is, 
<br />
system qualities at different stages of evolution are linked by the 
<br />
relationship of emergence: they have something in common, but they differ 
<br />
by concrete forms - a succession of forms is resulting with each form 
<br />
containing the previous form by negating the previous form. emergent 
<br />
evolution adds new qualities to the old ones and redefines hereby what is 
<br />
in common (what is general, universal) and what is not (what is specific, 
<br />
particular). so the relationship of the universal and the particular is a 
<br />
historical one (and not only a logical one).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you distinguish two views on information: subjectivist and objectivist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This seems quite close to the two approaches of knowledge: constructivism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(knowledge as specific build up of reality by the knowing element) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representationalism (knowledge as a true image of the outside world).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would you agree on this comparison ?
</em><br />
<p>yes, that's the difference between the two views regarding human cognition.
<br />
<p>like the options of capurro's trilemma and the options of snow's cultures 
<br />
objectivism and subjectivism are one-sided, and therefore not completely 
<br />
wrong. my intention is to reconcile the views by analysing what can be 
<br />
accepted.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If by any chance you have developped elsewhere some of the points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addressed in your short article, please let us know.
</em><br />
<p>unfortunately, since the end of october i have been trying to replace my 
<br />
extended abstract on the website by a full version draft - the mdpi 
<br />
webmasters could not help so far. i will attach my file to a personal email 
<br />
to you.
