<p>I'd add 'risk' 'asymmetric information' 'growth' and the key concepts
<br />
of neo-classical growth theory.
<br />
<p>cf Kenneth Arrow's 'Information as a Good' <a href="../../www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/festschrift/Papers/Stig-Arrow.pdf">http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/festschrift/Papers/Stig-Arrow.pdf</a>
<br />
<p>It would be interesting to see if and how our entropic symmetry concepts match
<br />
the economists' notion of symmetry and information. Maybe Ken can answer that one
<br />
in Paris if he's there?
<br />
<p>If economics is the 'dismal science' IS must be the 'abysmal science' - as we stare
<br />
down the precipice into this terra incognita there are no interdisciplinary conceptual pitons
<br />
we can use to grapple with the rock face (unlike 'value' 'growth' 'competition' 'market' 'equilibrium' etc in economics).
<br />
<p>Arrow's concept of information is predicated on economic uncertainty rather than on the Shannon entropy. Paul M. Romer's 'new growth' theory and the separation of 'goods' and  'ideas' has been the controversial clarion of the knowledge economy.
<br />
<p>I think non-Darwinian models such as these need to be taken into account when we
<br />
consider the emergent bioeconomic networks you are suggesting.

<br />
<p><p>Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>At the risk of adding to the current &quot;entropy&quot; of themes in the list, I
<br />
would like to enter a few points on networks in society, in economy and
<br />
elsewhere --just as a solo reflection!
<br />
<p>To start with, why not discussing about the emergence of the social
<br />
networking phenomenon itself? Given that social networks are far beyond the
<br />
physicochemical happenstance (aren't they?), I think an interesting
<br />
&quot;foundational&quot; place to search by could be ethology, where we find a
<br />
relatively well-accepted concept to apply specifically to mammal groupings:
<br />
&quot;attachment&quot; (or inter-individual &quot;bonds&quot;: materno-filial bonds, family
<br />
bonds, groupal bonds, etc.).  It is a rather bizarre point, I can accept,
<br />
but it may be an interesting characterization for a basic level of
<br />
networking in all human societies: a basic fabric of primary, very strong
<br />
bonds --family ties-- we find everywhere. Also, one could take ideas from
<br />
Jared Diamond, and from many others, to argue about the existence of a
<br />
further level of natural grouping or networking, based on a more labile and
<br />
versatile level of &quot;medium&quot; bonds linking together, for instance, the
<br />
members of hunter-gatherer bands (e.g., relatives &amp; 'friends').
<br />
<p>Alas, with the creation of &quot;artificial ecosystems&quot; and the possibility to
<br />
complexify social nets,  most societies have historically added a great
<br />
variety of new types of bonds. In my previous message I alluded to
<br />
&quot;partitions&quot; that imply very weak social bonds that we may somehow
<br />
experiment under the form of multiple &quot;identities&quot;. Economy is basically
<br />
involved here, of course, as it becomes the main source of transient,
<br />
volatile, but overall very efficient and productive &quot;weak bonds&quot;. Thus, the
<br />
&quot;organizational revolution&quot; as coined  by Kenneth Boulding may also be seen
<br />
as a cacophony of multiple new classes of such weak bonds superimposed on
<br />
the primary level of medium and strong bonds. Retarded (or underdeveloped)
<br />
societies are unnatural, as much as are advanced societies --both depending
<br />
on artificial ecosystems and producing a very large ecological footprint--
<br />
but the former keeps a stronger net of primary bonds while the latter have
<br />
clearly less primary bonds and an extraordinary diversity of weak ones.
<br />
Amazing may seem, but statistics indicate that Nigerians have a higher
<br />
&quot;index of happiness&quot; than over-consumerism indulged US and Western citizens
<br />
(happiness would depend more closely on the structure of primary bonds
<br />
around oneself than on accumulation of techno-gadgets and obesity).
<br />
<p>In the story of social networking, knowledge creation has also to be
<br />
involved, fundamentally, as the greatest transformations in social
<br />
networking have been preceded by great jumps in the social elaboration and
<br />
dissemination of knowledge --several scientific and industrial revolutions
<br />
as we have called them. let us note that, intrinsically, science and
<br />
technology partake the form of nets too, and some aspects of this very
<br />
discussion have already surfaced in previous fis discussions (&quot;locality&quot; of
<br />
sci. knowledge, interdisciplinarity, consilience...)
<br />
<p>To sum up these crude reflections: ecological networks, social-economic
<br />
networks, scientific-technological networks, How are they related? Let me
<br />
finally suggest to our discussion chairs, Bob and Igor, that we look afresh
<br />
on these networks organizing principles, both specific and common--perhaps
<br />
among them: information, ascendancy, value... It may conduce to another
<br />
interesting approach to the sustainability theme.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
