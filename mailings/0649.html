Dear Pedro:
<br />
<p>I certainly agree with you that the different kinds of cellular systems
<br />
that you enumerate are heterogeneous in nature. I also agree that my
<br />
dynamical model of the meaning of information does not encompass them
<br />
all. I am not clear whether this means that (1) the notion of
<br />
information simply cannot be unified under a single model---that is,
<br />
there is an irreducible pluralism of kinds of information; (2) we ought
<br />
to restrict the notion of information (at least in the intrinsic and
<br />
semantic sense) to only some of the these systems; or (3) my model is
<br />
completely on the wrong track and should be abandoned altogether.
<br />
(Obviously, these are not mutually exclusive possibilities!)
<br />
<p>One point I would like to make in defense of my model is that it may be
<br />
applied at various hierarchical levels.  Thus, the individual protein
<br />
may be envisaged as a low-energy-trigger dependent, nonlinear
<br />
oscillator, but so may higher-level systems such as metabolic pathways,
<br />
nucleoprotein complexes, organelles, cells, multicellular organs, whole
<br />
organisms, and societies. (The model is intended to apply to any
<br />
cognitive agent whatsoever.) Since &quot;low-energy&quot; is a relative concept,
<br />
the fact that allosteric regulation of proteins within higher-level
<br />
systems occurs via covalent bonding may or may not be able to be
<br />
accommodated by the model.
<br />
<p>Whether this is an adequate answer to your challenge, I don't know.  I
<br />
am certainly open to other ideas.  Let me just mention the desiderata
<br />
that I was hoping that my model would satisfy, and that I think need to
<br />
be met somehow, if we are to arrive at a satisfactory understanding of
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>(1) Intrinsicness --- We should account for the information relation (or
<br />
interaction) as it exists for a given organism itself, not as its exists
<br />
for the human observer who is theorizing the relation. Of course, such
<br />
an account can then be applied to the act of observation, as well, but
<br />
the intrinsic or objective case is fundamental.
<br />
<p>(2) Normativity --- Any theory of information ought to take into account
<br />
the normative or semantic aspect of information. The value or meaning of
<br />
information for an organism is the heart of the matter.
<br />
<p>(3) Action --- Information should be understood in a pragmatic sense, as
<br />
essentially involved in functional action.
<br />
<p>(4) Emergence --- We must try to understand our own case as emerging
<br />
over time out of simpler cases, not theorize simpler and evolutionarily
<br />
earlier cases in terms of concepts that apply primarily to us. Thus,
<br />
implicit knowing (knowing how) is more fundamental than explicit knowing
<br />
(knowing that).
<br />
<p>(5) Self-Organization --- There must be a way to understand how the
<br />
information relation can have come into being via a natural process
<br />
(i.e., with the origin of life). This seems to me to require a
<br />
&quot;bottom-up&quot; theory that begins at the level of macromolecules, because
<br />
if we refer the normativity to the cell as a whole in a &quot;top-down&quot;
<br />
fashion, how can we ever hope to explain how such a system came into
<br />
existence?
<br />
<p>Even if my own theory fails to take all the forms of information you
<br />
mention into account, perhaps it might be useful to discuss whether a
<br />
successful theory of information must satisfy these criteria.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
<p>James
