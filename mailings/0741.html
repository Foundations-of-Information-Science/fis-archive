Just a short post as I am having problems with my computer right now as I 
<br />
gradually upgrade to Windows XP.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Edwina used the term &quot;logic&quot; in the context of Socratic caves, Aristotle

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(and many I presume) her use of the term puts her use in domain 3. My

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point was that most workers in logic have many different logics. All are

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;invented for different purposes and distort the reality they represent and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about which they reason.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You used the term &quot;logic&quot; in such a way that means (I think) that there is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some coherent set of laws in domain 1 that result in reproducable effects. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As common terms of art in computer science, I use &quot;mechanics&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;physics&quot; for domain 1, and &quot;logic&quot; variously for the rest. I believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is a large distance of abstraction among these four. Edwina at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believes 2 and 1 are the same or close and &quot;logic&quot; covers both. Whatever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you choose is a religious decision, but there are tens of thousands of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;places where you can recount what people said about the the relationships 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among 1, 2 and 3. I suppose it has pedagogical value, but that Christmas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tree is pretty well decorated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I interpret the FIS to agenda to be concerned with domain 4 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships with the others. There are very few forums for this, so I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suppose the focus here to be worth preserving.
</em><br />
<p>I think that it is correct that the FIS agenda is primarily in domain 4. In 
<br />
order to carry out this task in more than an intuitive way, we need to have 
<br />
a common language to relate domains 1 and 2, and for putting the 
<br />
limitations of 3 into perspective. It seems to me the only possibility is 
<br />
logic, which I tend to equate with information theory (at least in terms of 
<br />
formal syntax and semantics -- the pragmatics and rhetoric are different, 
<br />
on the surface, anyway).
<br />
<p>Thus I agree with Edwina that logic applies to domain 1. If it doesn't then 
<br />
we are in trouble. This is possible, I would say (my colleague Cliff Hooker 
<br />
has joked about the physicist who has a revelation and reports &quot;I have seen 
<br />
the truth and it doesn't make sense&quot;). So we have to make a defeasible 
<br />
presumption that there is a discoverable order in the world that is 
<br />
isomorphic in some non-trivial way to some logical order. The limits of 
<br />
this methodology are empirical, but I think they are the limits of 
<br />
knowledge as opposed  to opinion in the form of hocus pocus and good luck. 
<br />
Anything that orders the domain  of 1 would, ipso facto, be a logic. If it 
<br />
only appears to order (applies only to domain 2), it is still a logic, but 
<br />
perhaps no the right one.
<br />
<p>Hertz proposed that a theory tries to get a congruence of its logical order 
<br />
and the causal order of its object. This congruence makes the causal order 
<br />
of the object a logic in the semantic/syntax sense. This ignores the 
<br />
pragmatic and rhetorical aspects of logic, which is in tune with the 
<br />
treatment of logic in contemporary mathematics. These aspects can severely 
<br />
restrict our ability to think with a logic, but it does not rule out the 
<br />
world being logical. See also Rosen. More anon.
<br />
<p>Complex systems are more or less by definition not completely analyzable (I 
<br />
have a four-fold account of complete analyzability, which includes 
<br />
definability, empirical diagnosability, predictability and reducibility -- 
<br />
the four are separate, not as the Logical empiricists  thought different 
<br />
versions of the same thing). This is also true of arithmetic, so it is 
<br />
debatable whether the Logicist program was successful -- Gila Sher argues 
<br />
that this depends on ones view of logic -- if it is just the constructive 
<br />
part of formal science then no, but if the non-constructive part is 
<br />
included, then pretty much yes -- I prefer the latter, but it is a matter 
<br />
of taste (or religion, if you want). On the former (nominalist) view there 
<br />
can be multiple logics that are not unified; on the latter account 
<br />
(realist) they are all part of one logic (see, for example Zinove'ev for an 
<br />
argument that all alternative logics are really a part of one logic). On 
<br />
the logicist/realist view there can be logics that are not fully analyzable 
<br />
(basically, mechanical in one traditional sense of the term, equivalent to 
<br />
Rosen's usage). So the world can be logical, and in a sense explicable, 
<br />
even if it does not satisfy certain pragmatic and rhetorical desiderata, 
<br />
such as empirical decidability (testability) and analytic provability 
<br />
(again, the Positivists were wrong here -- they assumed the wrong logic). I 
<br />
think that the nominalist tendency is a hangover of the early assumptions 
<br />
that something like Hilbert's Formalism is true (I include Conceptualism 
<br />
and various forms of Psycholigism with respect to logic in this class). 
<br />
This is not now sustainable. Even uninterpreted formal systems like Post 
<br />
canonical systems can have theorems that are not provable. There is no 
<br />
purely constructive formal system, just ones we construct, and the limits 
<br />
of our constructions. To say that these are the limits of order in the 
<br />
world is a form of hubris, I think. We cannot say with certainty what 
<br />
formal systems on the complexity of arithmetic and set theory or higher 
<br />
apply to. We must give up (the hope of) certainty and embrace fallibility. 
<br />
Peirce was very prescient in recognizing this is the proper way 
<br />
(pragmatically justified way) to embrace pragmatism.
<br />
<p>I also agree with Edwina that the domain of 2 and 1 are not distinct. 2 is 
<br />
contained in 1. We should not forget that out theories are a part of the 
<br />
world as well. This also goes for 3. Our logics are thus at best theories 
<br />
of an object, confusingly also called 'logic'. Our theories of logic do not 
<br />
exhaust logic (and cannot fully).
<br />
<p>So I think that domain 4 is:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the discovery of logic (Peirce again would agree -- for him 
<br />
semeiotics and logic were one).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the development of a suitable pragmatics for logic (I think this 
<br />
is semiotics -- analytic philosophers have dispensed with this, thinking 
<br />
they can formalize pragmatics -- e.g., Montague. This has been proven to be 
<br />
impossible, unless we follow Hilary Putnam and argue that there is no 
<br />
domain 1, just an idealized version of domain 2 -- Putnam cites Peirce, but 
<br />
he uses a verificationist criterion of meaning that is foreign to Peirce, 
<br />
and leads to a substantive notion of truth rather than Peirce's 
<br />
methodological/regulative principle of truth.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the application of suitable rhetorics to disarm dis-integrative 
<br />
approaches to information and logic, including the forcing of 
<br />
methodological fallibilism (not to be confused with scepticism, even of 
<br />
Hume's weakish academic -- for a modern version of the latter, see David 
<br />
Lewis's paper &quot;Lost Knowledge&quot; -- I think it is a reductio ad absurdum of 
<br />
verificationist notions of truth).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the integration of the above three in an open ended project (see 
<br />
next paragraph).
<br />
<p>Finally, domain 4 is embedded in domain 3 which is embedded in domain 1, 
<br />
but our senses of 1, 2, and 3 depend on and presuppose 4 as we have it, 
<br />
either tacitly or explicitly (usually a mixture). This looks like a 
<br />
hopeless entanglement. Entangled yes, but hopeless no. I think we must 
<br />
resist the tendency to reduce one the other domains to one of them, or we 
<br />
will end up with a circularity. Likewise we should not seal the domains 
<br />
from each other, or they become self-justifying and dis-integrated. So, we 
<br />
need to keep our systems open, and recognize that all systems in the world 
<br />
are also open. Just as we can be under committed and miss the truth, we can 
<br />
be over committed and miss the truth. There is no final closure to the 
<br />
project. This is not a reason to think that there can be no progress, which 
<br />
stems first of all from anomalies among the four domains. Empirical facts 
<br />
can impinge on mathematical theory, and vice versa (to think otherwise is 
<br />
to buy into the analytic-synthetic distinction, which Quine effectively 
<br />
trashed, along with Hanson, Feyerabend and perhaps Kuhn). In order to avoid 
<br />
getting caught in vicious circles, one has to adjust ones pragmatics to 
<br />
leave interpretations open ended, and ones rhetoric to dismiss categorical 
<br />
(absolute, non-context-dependent) statements of dependency and closure.
<br />
<p>Just some thoughts. See my doctoral dissertation for details.
