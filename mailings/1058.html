<p>
Well, Pedro, first of all I apologize for not participating in the 
<br />
discussions  -- life was too dynamic last year. As to my reminiscences on 
<br />
the old points, which might be slightly out of context, this would be as 
<br />
follows.
<br />
<p>1. Every semiotic system, be it a theory like Euclidian geometry or a 
<br />
general frame of thinking,  is based on axioms (postulates), from which 
<br />
other properties of this system are derived. The same sets of &quot;natural&quot; 
<br />
phenomena may be described through different sets of axioms, from which 
<br />
some are just more convenient and more &quot;common sense&quot;, and some are not.
<br />
<p>2. Information as such appears to be a concept very difficult to define, 
<br />
because it is defined through axioms including concepts of space, time, 
<br />
matter and mind. The contradictions arise mostly between matter and mind, 
<br />
hence the main question of philosophy -- which is primary and which is 
<br />
secondary, matter or mind. Here we have to go into very difficult issues 
<br />
like to what extent the information is material (never existing without 
<br />
material carrier) and to what extent it is, so to speak, &quot;ideal&quot;, i.e. 
<br />
immaterial -- and it is to a degree immaterial, as the same information may 
<br />
be conveyed via different material carriers (ink and pen, voice, electric 
<br />
signals, etc)
<br />
<p>3. However life becomes much easier if we set up a different axiomatics, in 
<br />
which the concept of &quot;information&quot; becomes one of axioms. This relieves us 
<br />
from the burden of defining WHAT is information, leaving us studying the 
<br />
PROPERTIES of information. Remember that when Einstein failed to explain 
<br />
why the speed of light is constant regardless of the frame of reference, he 
<br />
just postulated that this is so, and obtained all the wonderful results 
<br />
about PROPERTIES of relative time and space using this as a postulate.
<br />
<p>4. I would suggest the following axiomatics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Information is the primary concept, definable through its 
<br />
properties. Everything in the material and immaterial world is information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Information is material. Matter thus becomes a property of 
<br />
information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no information without matter, as 
<br />
information is produced, transmitted and processed via material substances, 
<br />
processes and devices.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no matter without information. We perceive 
<br />
matter via information exchange, each act of perception, be it sensual 
<br />
perception or perception through instruments, is an act of information 
<br />
exchange. Matter that does not exchange information with us does not exist 
<br />
for us. For example, in the special theory of relativity there is a concept 
<br />
of &quot;absolute past&quot;, &quot;absolute future&quot; and &quot;absolute remote&quot;. The latter is 
<br />
the area in Minkowski space-time  from where no information can be ever 
<br />
received.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Information is ideal.  Ideal thus becomes a property of information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no information without ideal part. The 
<br />
SAME information can be produced, transmitted and processed via DIFFERENT 
<br />
material substances, processes and devices. This includes, as a particular 
<br />
case, a human observer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ideal without information. Everything 
<br />
we call ideal or conscious deals with information. Every IDEA as such is 
<br />
informative. Including ideas formulated by a human observer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Information is contextual. It is read and processed against an 
<br />
existing context. A phrase in an unknown language will be differently 
<br />
understood by people knowing it and not knowing it. An instrument devised 
<br />
to measure fluctuations of electric fields will not be capable of 
<br />
processing acoustically transmitted information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Context is informative. Received information changes the context. 
<br />
The sequence of bits received by the computer alters its memory, thus 
<br />
affecting the algorithm of processing of the concomitant sequences of bits. 
<br />
Reading a book alters the context of human mind, thus altering the 
<br />
interpretation of concomitant books.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Information possesses the property of recursive embedding. We call 
<br />
recursive embedding a situation when, for a certain system, its description 
<br />
is embedded in the system as one of its elements. Examples include:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- A library catalog is, as a physical book, part 
<br />
of the library.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- A DNA molecule is an encoded description of an 
<br />
organism. But it is also a molecule, which is included in the biochemistry 
<br />
of the very cell it describes. By the way, the information in the DNA 
<br />
molecule is read against the current biochemical content of the cell, as 
<br />
differen genes are expressed under different conditions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- a population (species) adapt to environment an, 
<br />
in a sense, the properties of the species is an encoded description of the 
<br />
properties of the environment. However, by its very presense, the species 
<br />
alters the environment and, at the same time becomes part of it. This is 
<br />
another manifestation of contextuality.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Such a recursive embedding produces infinite recursion, as the 
<br />
description has to contain itself in the form of description of 
<br />
corresponding material element. For example, DNA molecule includes a number 
<br />
of genes that encode its own existence and processing of genes (genes of 
<br />
DNA polymerases etc).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. The realization of this infinite recursion is not instantaneous. 
<br />
This infinite recursion, i.e. constant reprocessing of information at large 
<br />
against the context including itself, at different hierarchical levels, 
<br />
constitutes the process of DEVELOPMENT, the process of EVOLUTION, be it 
<br />
physical, biological, social or other evolution.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that those who were able to stay awake through this long and 
<br />
boring text, will understand what I mean. I wrote some of this in some of 
<br />
my papers, to which the references can be found at

<p>Igor, why don't you send again to the list those old points --or perhaps 
<br />
re-elaborate them? It would nicely dovetail the present discussions. best.
