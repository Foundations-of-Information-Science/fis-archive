JOHANNESBURG JUNCTION
<br />
<p>Walden Bello*
<br />
<p>(This article also appears in Red Pepper, September 2002)
<br />
<p>Ten years after the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and 
<br />
Development, the global environmental situation is unarguably worse. 
<br />
The main culprit: an unchecked capitalist mode of production that 
<br />
unceasingly transforms nature's bounty into commodities and 
<br />
incessantly creates new demands. Capitalism constantly erodes man and 
<br />
woman's being-in-nature (creature) and being-in-society (citizen) 
<br />
and, even as it drains them of life energy as workers, it moulds 
<br />
their consciousness around one role: that of consumer. Capitalism has 
<br />
many &quot;laws of motion,&quot; but one of the most destructive as far as the 
<br />
environment goes is Say's law, which is that supply creates its own 
<br />
demand. Capitalism is a demand-creating machine that transforms 
<br />
living nature into dead commodities, natural wealth into dead capital.
<br />
<p>Capitalism has expanded unevenly, being now overdeveloped in its 
<br />
heartland in the North and underdeveloped in the periphery. Thus its 
<br />
environmental impact has likewise been differentially distributed. 
<br />
Nothing captures this better than the difference in per capita 
<br />
greenhouse gas emissions: one American emits as much as 17 
<br />
Maldiveans, 19 Indians, 30 Pakistanis, 49 Sri Lankans, 107 
<br />
Bangladeshis, 134 Bhutanese, and 269 Nepalis.
<br />
<p>The global impact of the superdeveloped capitalist North may, in 
<br />
fact, be greater than the comparative statistics reveal. For in 
<br />
response to the rise of the environmental movement, the North has 
<br />
displaced ecological disequilibrium to the South. Perhaps 
<br />
paradigmatic in this regard is the way Japanese capital has lived up 
<br />
to environmental standards in the homeland by accelerating its 
<br />
consumption of nature and creation of waste to East and Southeast 
<br />
Asia. Japanese consumption, for instance, was responsible for up to 
<br />
70 per cent of timber logged--most of it illegally--in the 
<br />
Philippines from the fifties to the nineties. Japanese consumption of 
<br />
commodities produced from a safe distance drove the uncontrolled 
<br />
toxification that accompanied the massive transfer of Japan's 
<br />
pollution-intensive and labor-intensive manufacturing facilities to 
<br />
that region beginning in the late 1960s.
<br />
<p>Today, European and US capital have joined Japanese capital in making 
<br />
cheap-labor, pollution-friendly China both the workshop and the 
<br />
wastebasket of the world. What is happening to China and East Asia 
<br />
today is, however, only the latest phase of capitalist 
<br />
globalization's 150-year-old process of displacing the environmental 
<br />
costs of global capitalist production and consumption from the center 
<br />
to the subordinate parts of the world economy.
<br />
<p>Ten years ago, George Bush Senior torpedoed the Rio Summit by saying 
<br />
&quot;America's lifestyle is not up for negotiation.&quot; The Europeans and 
<br />
the Japanese feigned horror, but the next ten years showed that 
<br />
consumption was king for them too, and that ever escalating 
<br />
consumption was the common recipe for keeping the global capitalist 
<br />
economy going. The Group of Seven has essentially served as a forum 
<br />
to negotiate which capitalist center would serve at which period as 
<br />
the consumption-engine of the global economy. The so-called 
<br />
management of the international economy is essentially a process of 
<br />
determining which center would accelerate its conversion of nature 
<br />
into commodity and commodity into waste.
<br />
<p>Today, the Johannesburg Summit is stillborn, killed over a year 
<br />
before it was held by George W. Bush's decision to withdraw the 
<br />
world's prime capitalist power from being party to the Kyoto Climate 
<br />
Change protocol. This is capitalism stripped of its liberal face, 
<br />
capitalism that reveals its essential nature as an enemy of nature. 
<br />
The Japanese and European elites pretend to be upset, but what they 
<br />
are most upset about is the Americans' frank acknowledgment of the 
<br />
basic dynamic of the system of production they all share: that its 
<br />
continuing expansion must be achieved via an accelerated consumption 
<br />
and toxification of nature.
<br />
<p>Johannesburg will be a mixture of corporate greenwashing, American 
<br />
bullying, European holier-than-thou posturing, third world leaders 
<br />
begging for aid in return for more pro-corporate liberalization, and 
<br />
the World Trade Organization hijacking the environment in the service 
<br />
of free trade. It is one more UN conference bound for ignominious 
<br />
failure.
<br />
<p>This failure comes at a time when Latin America is exploding in 
<br />
rebellion against neo-liberal economics and lack of accountability 
<br />
and systemic corporate criminality has eroded the credibility of 
<br />
corporate capitalism in the United States, with 72 per cent of 
<br />
Americans feeling that corporations have too much power over their 
<br />
lives.
<br />
<p>It comes at a time when, owing to the crisis of overproduction or 
<br />
overcapacity, global capitalism's ability to consume its way out of 
<br />
crisis is stymied. The US, Japan, Europe, and East Asia---the engines 
<br />
of consumption-driven growth--now face the spectre of a synchronized 
<br />
downspin. What analysts from Marx to Schumpeter have discerned as 
<br />
self-destructive dynamics of the capitalist system is developing as 
<br />
nature's revolt becomes more and more evident each day and as 
<br />
consumers throughout the world are turning into citizens determined 
<br />
to regain community, to recreate a social solidarity that has been 
<br />
undermined by capitalism.
<br />
<p>Johannesburg may well be remembered a significant signpost in the 
<br />
struggle between capitalism and the environment, capitalism and 
<br />
community. Which side will prevail remains to be seen.
<br />
<p>*Executive Director of Focus on the Global South.
