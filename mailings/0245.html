An Invitation for FIS participation in
<br />
the Forty-third Meeting of
<br />
the International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS)
<br />
<p>June 27-July 2, 1999
<br />
Asilomar Conference Center on the Monterey Peninsula
<br />
Pacific Grove, California, USA
<br />
<p>HUMANITY, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY:
<br />
THE SYSTEMIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE INFORMATION AGE
<br />
<p>During the past few centuries we have achieved a remarkable synthesis of
<br />
science and technology.  We have been less successful in establishing a
<br />
graceful or even workable relationship between nature, humanity,
<br />
science, and technology.  It is becoming increasingly important for us
<br />
to ask the fundamental questions that will lead to an understanding of
<br />
these relationships.
<br />
<p>Unique to our age is the massive scale at which we are applying science
<br />
and technology to the construction of our physical, social, and cultural
<br />
reality.  However, our approach to the construction of these realities
<br />
is fragmented.  A distinguishing feature of the next millennium must be
<br />
a more systemic view of science and technology.  A view that gives full
<br />
expression to the creative energy of the human spirit upon which the
<br />
information age can be built.
<br />
<p>A disciplined approach to engaging our creative energy calls for a level
<br />
of understanding that crosses the boundaries between the humanities, the
<br />
arts, the sciences, and technologies.  It certainly calls for a
<br />
re-examination of science, one that embraces different ways of knowing,
<br />
and different ways of being.  The boundary-crossings may well be rooted
<br />
in our humanity, in our conceptions of aesthetics, justice, morality,
<br />
and ethics.
<br />
<p>The above discussion echoes the sentiments of the early systems
<br />
thinkers.  They asked: How can science be unified?  How can science be
<br />
applied to the improvement of the human condition?   Since the time when
<br />
these questions were asked, humanity has achieved a remarkable synthesis
<br />
of science and technology.  Some fragmentation has been overcome;
<br />
however, significant, and deep-rooted fragmentation remains.  It may
<br />
well be that in order for us to take the next step, the original
<br />
questions should be rephrased to read: How can the improvement of the
<br />
human condition become the basis for the unification of science?  How
<br />
can the unification of science become the basis for the improvement of
<br />
the human condition?
<br />
<p>A common basis for the answers to these questions may well be found in
<br />
the work of the FIS research group.  Serious reflection upon the  FIS
<br />
agenda over the past several years indicates that our work encompasses
<br />
the full spectrum of approaches to disciplined inquiry, ranging from the
<br />
purely epistemological to the ontological.  This is certainly reflected
<br />
in the breadth of the discussion that has taken place during the virtual
<br />
conferencing since the Vienna meeting.
<br />
<p>If a new conception of &quot;what information is&quot; leads to a bridge between
<br />
the epistemological and the ontological, then we may have found the
<br />
keystone to the information age.
<br />
<p>This is an invitation for us to continue the on-going FIS discussion in
<br />
a face-to-face, retreat-style format during the 43rd Annual Meeting of
<br />
ISSS.  A small group of FIS members have been organizing a symposium and
<br />
paper session for the conference; Soren Brier has been kind enough to
<br />
chair this group.  The FIS call for papers can be found at
<br />
&lt;www.sysval.org/isss/1999call.htm&gt; or &lt;www.isss.org/1999call.htm&gt;.  We
<br />
have the option of expanding FIS participation to include additional
<br />
paper sessions, as well as small group discussions.
<br />
<p>Please communicate with me any suggestions you have for closer
<br />
collaboration between FIS and ISSS.
<br />
<p>BŽla Antal Banathy
<br />
ISSS President
