                <p>
                    Dear All
                    <br />
                <p>Thank you for your indeed interesting contributions during the past week. I
                    <br />
                    have the impression that we have got a bit of the main road - from the
                    <br />
                    earthly problems related to organization, development and environment which
                    <br />
                    were outlined in Bob's and mine text to the more philosophical questions
                    <br />
                    about final causes in the Universe. I would like to invite everybody to take
                    <br />
                    a step back and address the main theme. In this context I agree with Loet
                    <br />
                    that &quot;Sustainability is mainly a political program; it is vaguely defined.
                    <br />
                    One never hears a specification about &quot;sustainability&quot; for how long? Ten
                    <br />
                    year, hundred?&quot;
                    <br />
                    This problem has long history in ecological economics discourse (see the
                    <br />
                    overview and the possible way out of this tangle: Robinson, J. (2004).
                    <br />
                    Squaring the circle? Some thoughts on the idea of sustainable development.
                    <br />
                    Ecological Economics, 48, 369-384.). Because sustainability or sustainable
                    <br />
                    living is so vague and the environmental and human problems involved in
                    <br />
                    development so pressing, Bob and myself wished to throw this hot issue in
                    <br />
                    the FIS framework with the hope to get fresh ideas and perspectives.
                    <br />
                <p>I'll just throw down few remarks on some last week contributions that may be
                    <br />
                    related to the core issue of our discussion. I found Stan's thoughts about
                    <br />
                    causation and entropy as the final cause of the Universe very intriguing and
                    <br />
                    provocative. However, from the point of social sciences the attempt to
                    <br />
                    reduce social action to entropy production is unacceptable as reductionist,
                    <br />
                    in the same vain as evolutionary psychology cannot be taken as a plausible
                    <br />
                    explanation for every possible dimension of individual human behavior.
                    <br />
                    Following the arguments expressed by philosopher of science Dupre (Dupr�,
                    <br />
                    John. Human Nature and the Limits of Science. Oxford: Clarendon Press,
                    <br />
                    (2001).) I believe that human behavior, and especially collective behavior,
                    <br />
                    is very much contextual and emerging and it cannot be meaningfully reduced
                    <br />
                    to genes, physiology or for that matter to quantum mechanics, although genes
                    <br />
                    and physiological processes certainly influence the mind and our behavior.
                    <br />
                    Stan's views are, however, directly relevant for the discussion of
                    <br />
                    sustainability, when he relates entropy production for the Universe and its
                    <br />
                    role as the final cause of violent human behavior:
                    <br />
                    &quot; We cannot resist warfare because we cannot resist the most prominent law
                    <br />
                    of Nature. As long as we engage in war while denouncing it at the same time,
                    <br />
                    I am entitled to say that we build in order to burn so that we may rebuild
                    <br />
                    again -- endlessly, with the ultimate result (after our superstructures lie
                    <br />
                    in the sand like the pyramids) of having satisfactorily contributed to
                    <br />
                    Universal equilibration. ... In warfare we only destroy our own things, in
                    <br />
                    building we destroy everything.
                    <br />
                <p>Compared to this views economics, which has been long labeled as &quot;dismal
                    <br />
                    science&quot;, appears as a fairy tale. The humanity appears to be doomed between
                    <br />
                    two options: to destroy endlessly its own civilizations or to destroy
                    <br />
                    nature. I don't believe that world is that much deterministic but I agree
                    <br />
                    that Stan's two options are perfectly real and do play part of our own
                    <br />
                    history. Perhaps it is the bias of myself coming from social sciences, that
                    <br />
                    I have to believe that a third option must be allowed to exist - that of
                    <br />
                    sustainable living. We may fail to reach this option, but I believe that we
                    <br />
                    should allow it the possibility to exist at least in principle. If social
                    <br />
                    sciences were unable address human problems from that normative, value laden
                    <br />
                    perspective, they would be useless for the society as whole. Therefore, I
                    <br />
                    think that Stan put the problem of sustainability in a strikingly sharp
                    <br />
                    perspective by proposing its alternatives: endless wars or environmental
                    <br />
                    collapses, or both of these at the same time.
                    <br />
                    The key question that arises quite naturally is whether we as scientists are
                    <br />
                    able to find viable, systemic solutions to avoid the latter alternatives.
                    <br />
                    The immediate second question is, even if scientist are able to find an
                    <br />
                    answer, will human societies be able to implement it via political
                    <br />
                    processes and on time to avoid ecological catastrophe (and probable
                    <br />
                    consequent violent conflicts (see for example works of Thomas Homer-Dixon on
                    <br />
                    that issue).
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the discussion so far, it appears that knowledge based economy, for
                    </em><br />
                    reasons related to entropy production and its inherent metastability, may
                    <br />
                    not be the solution to the problem. In that sense we moved some steps from
                    <br />
                    where we started. What may be the next step?
                    <br />
