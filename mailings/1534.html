Dear colleagues, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In a more abstract formulation one can model a time-space event in a
<br />
four-dimensional hyperspace. A four-dimensional probability distribution
<br />
allows us to compute with a four-dimensional probablistic entropy:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
H = - Sum(ijkl) p(ijkl) log (p(ijkl)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A variation can be modeled as a vector or a one-dimensional probability
<br />
distribution. A selection adds structure and one needs a matrix or a
<br />
two-dimensional probability distribution for the representation of
<br />
variation and selection. A matrix at each moment in time allows us to
<br />
model a trajectory (stabilization) or more generally a geometrical
<br />
representation (a cube of information). A four-dimensional probability
<br />
distribution a hyper-space of time and space, that is, globalization.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As Leibniz noted, the calculus frees us from working with the
<br />
imagination. Cellular automata can represent the more complex phenomena
<br />
using a graphical interface of (that is, a window on) the complex
<br />
dynamics in the array of four dimensions that is used for the computing
<br />
in the background. The entropy measures enable us to evaluate the
<br />
results algorithmically and also to decompose them.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<p><p><p>&nbsp;Guy, colleagues
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
indeed Cellular Automation approach can provide many hints solving
<br />
structure/information/communication/order related issues. 
<br />
The CA principle (just without titling it CA) was discussed long long
<br />
ago by Conrad Zuse in his &quot;Calculating space&quot; (1969, C. Zuse. Rechnender
<br />
Raum. Schriften zur Datenverarbeitung, vol. 1, Freidr. Vieweg &amp; Sohn,
<br />
Braunschweig, 1969, 74 pp.)  Very similar ideas are exploited by many
<br />
digital physicists recently.
<br />
CA based deterministic models are not limited to &quot;boring&quot; uniform or
<br />
symmetric structures, they can go as far as modeling chaotic or random
<br />
things, but the most interesting feature of some of the CA's is their
<br />
ability to work on &quot;the edge of chaos&quot; resulting in structures very
<br />
similar to those that we observe in our &quot;real world&quot;. 
<br />
My personal programming experience with CA is related with modeling of
<br />
exposure to wave action in a lake where waves emerge as a result of
<br />
&quot;communicating&quot; dots in space (water volume) under influence of an
<br />
external force (wind). Which in principle corresponds to the reality as
<br />
it is simply described by a set of &quot;communicating dots&quot;. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And my speculative reply to Guy's question on &quot;where is the
<br />
communication?&quot; in books, paintings, etc would be that communication may
<br />
be delayed and structure (printed text in book or forms and shapes in
<br />
painting)  is a signal communicated along the time axis. Targets here
<br />
are multiple receivers &quot;located&quot; within a past-present-future timeline
<br />
(relatively to an occasional receiver) or present-future (relatively to
<br />
a communicator). It is also interesting (though at first look this may
<br />
look quite a trivial fact) to notice that in the real world
<br />
communication between two points in space is inevitably done through a
<br />
temporal dimension (energy-waves), while communication  between  two
<br />
points in time necessarily involves spatial dimension (structures). So
<br />
the book, painting, and similar cases should represent the later.
<br />

<br />
Viktoras and colleagues,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I applaud the beautiful argument presented below concerning the central 
<br />
roles of time an communication in all processes resulting in pattern 
<br />
construction. I have recently perceived an increasing use of the term 
<br />
&quot;order for free&quot;, which I think was originally coined by Stuart 
<br />
Kauffman, but I think there is some confusion over the scope of this 
<br />
idea. I personally think it is an appropriate description of the 
<br />
behavior of a cellular automaton model when a simple set of updating 
<br />
rules for individual cells results in surprising macroscopic patterns 
<br />
(e.g., the formation of &quot;gliders&quot; in the game of life). However, the 
<br />
macroscopic patterns in this case are not actually a &quot;result&quot; in the 
<br />
sense of physical causation. In fact, the rules implied the 
<br />
macroscopic patterns at the outset. They were only surprising because 
<br />
we did not recognize the implications of the rules until we ran the CA 
<br />
simulation. The notion of &quot;order for free&quot; is sometimes applied to 
<br />
physical, self-organizing systems, which I think is misguided. The 
<br />
construction of physical pattern must always require time and 
<br />
communication, as Viktoras argued, and always requires the doing of 
<br />
work. It is never &quot;order for free&quot; because the cost of work must 
<br />
always be paid.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It is interesting (at least to me) to consider the phenomenon of 
<br />
construction done by an individual human, as in the writing of a book 
<br />
or the creation of a painting. These are certainly modes of pattern 
<br />
generation, and they require both time and work; but one could ask 
<br />
&quot;where is the communication?&quot; given that there is only one individual 
<br />
involved. My answer would be that these processes depend on internal 
<br />
communication among agents of cognition inside the head of the 
<br />
creators. I think we are all familiar with, and rather skilled at 
<br />
orchestrating this internal dialogue.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Best Wishes,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense in the real world as it would not exist in time. Next, - if we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider the time just as &quot;one more axis&quot; in the 4 dimensional space, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it starts to make no fundamental difference whether communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens in space or in time. In fact, no system emerge &quot;finally and at
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; once&quot; - just as &quot;flash-and-done&quot; and remains static without no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function, but, instead, structure of every natural or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial system emerges step-by-step as a result of a communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes in time. I.e. all structures/systems either grow, evolve or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are constructed over a period of time - all they are communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; re-projected from temporal to spatial dimensions. Thus the order can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be explained in frames of communication theory as a successful or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful communication either in time or in space - axis makes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no difference. Any real-world structure of a system as communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in space, is always supplemented by its functioning - communication in
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. A good example would be ergodic systems - one can replace the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time average (of some property) by an average taken over all members 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the ensemble frozen at a particular time and still see &quot;the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's take a text as an example system. Printed text is nothing more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then a &quot;frozen&quot; communication, and it takes time to emerge (be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written) as a result of thoughts or communication among people which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens in time. In order to be understood - the printed text has to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be &quot;unfrozen&quot; i.e. re-projected back to communication in time by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading it. Text in books is a spatial structure, but reading of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book &quot;takes&quot; time. What is the order then ? Now imagine the book of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than 500 pages with random words :) Nobody will read it as it has
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; no meaning, purpose, function, sense... It will no have context 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - value in the &quot;surrounding world&quot;. Book written with grammatical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; errors would be something in between sense and nonsense. More time has
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be spent to read and understand correctly what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated through it. The same is true for the DNR in systems made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of living cells.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This approach would also make a big difference between a living cow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the dead one, or between a clock and a smashed clock :) or just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other functioning vs. broken system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The example with the book seems to nicely explain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order/meaning/function/communication relations. So I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complete referencing to Einstein's thoughts again:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;We are like a little child entering a huge library. The walls are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows that someone must have written these books. It does not know who
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written. But the child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; books; a mysterious order it does not comprehend, but only dimly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspects...&quot;
