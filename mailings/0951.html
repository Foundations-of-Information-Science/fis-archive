<p>
. 19 March 1938. Mexico officially protested against the invasion of 
<br />
Austria by the German (Nazi) army. The President  of México Lázaro 
<br />
Cárdenas gave to Mexican Ambassador Isidro Fabela the instructions 
<br />
for presenting the protest to the League of Nations (Geneva, 
<br />
Switzerland).
<br />
<p>This League of Nations (LoN) had been created at the Peace Conference 
<br />
in 1920 in an attempt to outlaw war. It was intended that aggressor 
<br />
states would be punished by economic sanctions.
<br />
<p>The LoN had been  weakened from the outset  when  the US Senate 
<br />
refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and the USA did not join 
<br />
the League. However , the notion of 'collective security' survived. 
<br />
By the Locarno Treaties of 1925 Germany's western frontiers were 
<br />
guaranteed by Italy and Britain. At this time Germany joined the 
<br />
League. The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) renounced war as a means of 
<br />
settling disputes, and was signed by 65 nations.
<br />
<p>But such a notion of collective security proved of little lasting 
<br />
value due first to the growing rivalry in the Pacific between Japan 
<br />
and the USA and later to the aggressiveness of governments of 
<br />
Germany, Italy and Japan which decided to invade and conquer other 
<br />
lands in order to expand each one its dominions.
<br />
<p>During the II WW the allies agreed to create a new international 
<br />
organization to replace the ill-fated  League of Nations which proved 
<br />
unable  to stand up to international aggression in the 1930s,
<br />
<p>At the Umbarton Oaks (August-October 1944) and San Francisco 
<br />
(April-June 1945) conferences the participants worked out the 
<br />
circumstances that allowed the United Nations Organization to come 
<br />
into existence on 24 October 1945. The founding fathers of UNO 
<br />
determined that its three basic purposes should be:
<br />
<p>°  To maintain international peace and security
<br />
<p>°  To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for 
<br />
the principle of equal rights and self determination of peoples.
<br />
<p>°  To achieve international co-operation in solving international 
<br />
problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character 
<br />
and promote and encourage respect for human rights and for 
<br />
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, 
<br />
language or religion.
<br />
<p>Theoretically  the UNO's General Assembly and  Security Council have 
<br />
had the authority to discuss disputes. to make recommendations for the
<br />
settlements of such disputes. In addition if necessary, to order 
<br />
collective measures to enforce the peace under the assumption that it 
<br />
should not  intervene in matters which are essentially within the 
<br />
domestic jurisdiction of any state, in order to safeguard the 
<br />
principle of state sovereignty.
<br />
<p>Along the last 57 years the Security Council has been hampered by a 
<br />
lack of unanimity among the great powers and has only been able to 
<br />
mount some 'peacekeeping' operations, in which forces drawn from 
<br />
member-states have acted as buffers between warring states or 
<br />
factions, at the request of the government(s) concerned so as to make 
<br />
a resumption of hostilities less likely. The General Assembly has at 
<br />
least provided a forum where the states of the world can let off 
<br />
'steam'.
<br />
<p>The UNO is a free association of states presumably based upon the 
<br />
principle of state sovereignty, which means that it can only do as 
<br />
much - or as little - as its members states allow it to do
<br />
<p>The UNO 's overall record has been uneven. it has not lived up to the 
<br />
original ideals, but it had not failed entirely and had proved its 
<br />
usefulness in many conflicts until February 2003.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>19 March 2003 may be the date UNO's functionality is tragically 
<br />
broken by the decision taken by the authoritarian and antidemocratic 
<br />
alliance that USA's administration made with the rulers of England 
<br />
and Spain in order to overthrown the regime of Irak by means of a 
<br />
super modern warfare against the people of Irak who will suffer the 
<br />
impact of weapons for massive annihilation in order to assure a quick 
<br />
and definitive victory.
<br />
<p>This warring action is against the recommendation of the Security 
<br />
Council of UNO which could not accept the proposal of the Alliance 
<br />
thought it has obtained the acceptation of some member of this 
<br />
Council (representatives of few other countries) who expect to 
<br />
receive some reward, payment or recompense.
<br />
<p>This war has been organized against the three basic purposes of UNO 
<br />
ignoring that it is unreasonable to continue reinforcing the war 
<br />
industry instead of attending the enormous needs of billions of 
<br />
people. In addition it will be illegal because the legal rules 
<br />
approved by the members of UNO, which are in fact international law. 
<br />
are simply disregarded.
<br />
<p>What will be definitely catastrophic in case it happen (let me assume 
<br />
that there is still some hope it  won't occur) is the fact that for 
<br />
the first time it has been used the presence of UNO officials for 
<br />
organizing the disarmament of a country before the war takes place.
<br />
In other words it means that the powerful USA successfully required - 
<br />
through UNO - the enemy to lay down their weapons before the battle.
<br />
<p>After this fatal experience of UNO the only decorous option for its 
<br />
members is to resign before this entity which is only 57 years old is 
<br />
closed after recognizing that it is dead because it became useless.
<br />
<p>Gordon Childe commented about the perspective of humankind that man 
<br />
makes himself. This disastrous war will be only the culmination of 
<br />
the sanguinary course that characterizes the history of humankind 
<br />
during the last six millennia but in the year 2003 it could be the 
<br />
beginning of the apocalypse. It has become a feasible event due to 
<br />
the presence of weapons for massive annihilation that are 
<br />
continuously produced in order to make profitable the war industry, 
<br />
no matter billions of people are against warfare. After all they can 
<br />
be only human resources increasingly useless for the high society due 
<br />
to the successful automation.
