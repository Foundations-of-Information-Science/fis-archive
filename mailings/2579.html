                <p>
                    Dear FIS-ers and Gordana,
                    <br />
                <p>I think this conversation is of interest to all of us
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>The stake at issue, I think, is as to whether information society (IS) tacitly should accept the
                    realist's dualist definition of a unary universe of observer-independent access to everyone -
                    including the realist's &quot;bucket model&quot; of knowledge acquisition, where the signal acts as
                    an information carrier between a presumed real &quot;reality&quot; and the unreal mind of the
                    observer. The IS must not be necessarily be locked in by the traditional realist view of physics -
                    since we very much operate on an abstract level - and therefore I think the time is ripe to pave a
                    more useful way around today's difficulties faced by traditional science. The other alternative open
                    to an IS-community, more appealing in my view, is the monist one, i.e., to consider a universe
                    (rather PRIVERSE since it turns out to be personal) where mind and reality is considered as a whole
                    where information is CREATED (for the sake of communication) in his mind/actuality and afterwards
                    explicated in models. Here the mathematical model is one available - logic and language another
                    among several others often disciplinary specific. In that view the human mind impression is nothing
                    else but a model - i.e., the body's way of reacting to its environment.
                    <br />
                <p>I think this is the main reason for this persistent dualist/monist battle taking place on this
                    IS-list.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>In reply to your mail (below) Gordana I would say:
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>I hope you see the absurd situation you place yourself in when you try to use a row of subjective
                    statements and opinions in attempts to defeat subjectivity - you then virtually cut off the branch
                    you are sitting on. To discuss as to whether it is useful or not to use the term &quot;real&quot; as
                    a category is one thing - but to defend realism by the use of subjective arguments is plain
                    self-contradiction. However this is a problem realists very seldom like to consider.
                    <br />
                <p>Then it could seem unfair that I, since I pleads for the SOA, can use subjective arguments without
                    involving in self-contradiction - but you have better to see this as principal limitation; Namely
                    the fact that a human being can never be anything else but subjective. The fact that we can gather
                    together in groups to present beliefs unfortunately do not make us less subjective. ( I prefer the
                    term &quot;subject-oriented&quot; because the term subjective has become a word of abuse in
                    classical science.)
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>You try to defend scientific realism, i.e., the dualist idea that science must operate with two
                    domains, one &quot;real&quot; and another &quot;unreal&quot; (or mental) moreover claiming that
                    &quot;reality&quot; is accessible and real. But the problem is, as I claim, that this question is
                    undecidable - and this is a problematics that should be very familiar to a computer scientist.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>In defending relism you also defend scientific objectivity - which is harder to define since it has
                    become deeply muddled by all obscure attempts to defend it - but we can at least see it as the
                    opposite of subjectivity. The line of demarcation is somewhat harder to draw - but from an
                    observational point of view one can say that the first person perspective (insider's view) is the
                    only allowable in the SOA when the third person perspective (outsider's view) is prescribed by the
                    object-oriented approach (OOA). However subjectivity has become a word of abuse in the framework of
                    OOA because of its emphasis on experimentation. Why? Can you have a feeling for the wish for power?
                    Curiously enough all realists accept Einstein's way of subjective reasoning when he e.g. sits on
                    quanta or uses elevators travelling at the speed of light - surprisingly enough even he himself.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>OOA was developed during the scientific revolution is defined by its experimental methodology (thus
                    involving observation) and succeeding modelling (for the sake of communication). Since then the
                    physical experiment has become the hallmark of science - if you cannot present an experimental
                    &quot;proof&quot; you are non-scientific - i.e., you resort to plain belief.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>This is the experimental way of deciding . that is, if you experimentally can show something this
                    experiment can be used to convince other people that you claim is correct - or at least useful.
                    However the test of usefulness is prediction - not consent.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>So now when you and Andrei admit you are unable to present a proof of the &quot;realness&quot; of
                    reality you are in trouble - because physics has no means to present such a proof (Goedel's 2nd see
                    below). Then you are directed make a decision in this matter by pure belief - and in this deed you
                    are subjective - which Andrei also admits - but this is also to say that you are non-objective.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>But there is a lot of questions that are undecidable by experiment - in fact all questions are
                    dependent on the consent of ostentation (which is the basis of language) - and in this situation we
                    must also rely on consensus. However consensus is a subjective group decision. Therefore you cannot
                    rely on consensus to dismiss subjectivity - without serious self-contradiction. On the other hand a
                    subjectivist can dismiss objectivity without running into self-contradiction because a consensual
                    decision is a legal one in his framework.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>So why is the question of real so important? Well, if the real/unreal dichotomy is experimentally
                    undecidable (and I can see a consensus here) then the realist's dualist way of operating with two
                    different domains is possibly bewildering and misleading - and definitely a matter of plain belief.
                    In fact I cannot see why the science of physics should uphold an undecidable distinction - then we
                    are just once more trying to prove the existence of God. As well doing non-science to my view.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>So Gornada if you claim your statements are non-subjective, i.e., objective I need better arguments
                    indeed - as a matter of fact I do not think you can even reach consensus about most of your
                    statements below. Andrei, on the other hand is better off, since he has a consensual back-up when
                    claiming the world is &quot;real&quot; - by, as already said, the fact this is a subjective group
                    decision, and then he can at least redefine a &quot;subjective group decision&quot; into an
                    &quot;objective decision&quot; and plead for the belief of majority. However this do not make his
                    (or his groups) point of view True - because he is this deed unable to find a truth template. His
                    group's point of view might not even be useful in the long run. Today's conceptual difficulties of
                    science indicates that we are facing this is very situation.
                    <br />
                <p>One way to convince me Gordana is to solve the &quot;realist's dilemma&quot; as earlier presented by
                    me - and you should, as a computer scientist, really be in the position to assimilate this dilemma.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>Below some of my comment marked AAAA on your recent mail:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think it can be a new very productive paradigm now when one can afford to
                        treat those processes individually so and not anonymize them making simplifying &gt;assumption
                        that they in average are the same. We might now start to be interested in what they do when they
                        keep individual behaviors and what is even more &gt;important individual strategies - that might
                        be especially relevant in biological systems.
                    </em><br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: What paradigm? To treat the &quot;real&quot; reality as a set of individual &quot;real&quot;
                    agents - and considering a stone as a &quot;real&quot; agent as well? I cannot see how you can
                    escape the problem of the human's &quot;limited&quot; capacity of observation that way.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me, that is the way to most naturally integrate the observer.
                    </em><br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: To become monist is really &quot;observer-integrating&quot; - Bohm and others calls it holism.
                    But you need to leave the observer-position of physicist's to consider human knowing as well - and
                    that the build-up of human knowing that has another basis but observation.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that Arnes assumption that the observer somehow innocently on her
                        own approaches the world and thus gets her own personal impressions or &gt;measurement results
                        or sensory data from the world - that is totally impossible!
                    </em><br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: This is your belief evidently. Would you then be so kind to tell me then in what way you think
                    a newly born child approaches the &quot;world&quot;?
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As an individual you approach the world with the conglomerate of tools and
                        theories that are materialization of the collective enterprise.
                    </em><br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: I'll repeat the foregoing question here.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you are in the loop, where you may just contribute with n+1st attempt to
                        approach THE SAME WORLD. And that is very essential.
                    </em><br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: Agree but THIS SAME WORD IS NOT REAL - IT IS CONCEPTUAL - mirroring the situation we use THE
                    SAME NAMES appointing the phenomena of our experience. To find out that all people PROBABLY refer to
                    the same sort of REALITY - is a act of mature consideration that take place late in life and
                    education - to find out that this REALITY only can be described as a &quot;body&quot; of stability
                    requires that one leaves the realist's (way) system of speaking. THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF GOEDEL'S
                    SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM - YOU CANNOT PROVE OR DISPROVE A SYSTEM FROM WITHIN. Accordingly it
                    seems reasonable that that the insight REALITY=STABILITY does not come until you dare to leave the
                    realist's way of thinking eventually by questioning its fundaments. This state of mature thinking is
                    bound to happen even at a later stage in life - however it seems most scientists do not even bother.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The world is the same during this short period of time we are here on

                        realist, not unusual for a physicist.

                <p>AAAA: This sounds very dogmatic to me - an attitude one often find among realists unfortunately. You
                    have to dare to question the basis of our own realistic thinking - and then you will see the
                    inconsistencies of this framework hopefully. Otherwise you have to put your trust in Goedel.

                    think a bat sees? I claim I can even formulate thoughts as newly born - well even explicate myself
                    without the help of others. We usually cry when we are newly born - we explicate a feeling (feel) -
                    don't you think so? What I cannot do however is to COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS WITHOUT THEIR HELP - but
                    this is quite a different matter.

                        with a world is possible, and even if it would be possible that single person &gt;without any

                <p>AAAA: It seem me as a rushed conclusion. To me this story says that unless you have a theory (the
                    &quot;right&quot; theory?) you cannot perceive what you think your teacher perceives. From where did
                    the teacher get his theory? Does he has access to the truth bu any means? Well to me this is a
                    lesson in the theory-laden-ness of perception - which is actually the fundamental cause of human
                    incapacity to decide what is real from unreal.

                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Andrei and Arne,
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it can be a new very productive paradigm now when one can afford to treat those
                    processes individually so and not anonymize them making simplifying assumption that they in average
                    are the same. We might now start to be interested in what they do when they keep individual
                    behaviors and what is even more important individual strategies - that might be especially relevant
                    in biological systems.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, that is the way to most naturally integrate the observer.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Arnes assumption that the observer somehow innocently on her own approaches
                    the world and thus gets her own personal impressions or measurement results or sensory data from the
                    world - that is totally impossible!
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As an individual you approach the world with the conglomerate of tools and theories that
                    are materialization of the collective enterprise.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;So you are in the loop, where you may just contribute with n+1st attempt to approach THE
                    SAME WORLD. And that is very essential.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The world is the same during this short period of time we are here on earth. Otherwise,
                    no science, and no human communication would ever be possible without the existence of that fast
                    point - constantly existing and essentially stable physical world. I am realist, not unusual for a
                    physicist.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;What I claim is that you don't even see without the help from others.

                    object say an eye of a fly.
