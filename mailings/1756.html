<p>
Malcom and Stan,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malcom's preference to one-world view seems quite continental in the
<br />
spirit of Rafael instead of merely being analytical, and not quite
<br />
antagonistic to Stan's preference to many-worlds. Here is my excuse.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are happy with applying the successful standard practice of quantum
<br />
mechanics to the physical universe at large, we may also have to assume
<br />
somebody who would sit outside of the universe and see what is going on in
<br />
the inside. According to the accepted user's manual, the universe may
<br />
transit from the possible to the actual every time the observer does the job
<br />
through the collapse of the wavefunction. However, there have been some
<br />
dissidents including Everett, DeWitt and Gell-Mann among others as charging
<br />
the idea outrageous.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeWitt's many-world interpretation must be one necessary consequence out
<br />
of dismissing the idea of the observer sitting outside of the universe as
<br />
unfounded. One remedy for the purpose would be to live with another
<br />
outrageous picture that our actual universe is just one of the many
<br />
alternatives when the inhabitants look into the past, while it constantly
<br />
serves as the source of branching off into many alternatives toward the
<br />
future. One sturdy problem with the many-world scenario is whether the
<br />
universe we experience as the incumbents has anything special compared with
<br />
all of the others already branched off. This question touches upon what is
<br />
the durable fundamental set of the elements constructing the actual
<br />
universe, that is , the choice of the preferred basis set in the physicist
<br />
jargon. No easy solution in sight, so far.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Jerry's concern on chemical syntax may enter. Firstly,
<br />
quantum mechanics grounds itself upon the present progressive tense being
<br />
concurrent and punctuated with the present perfect tense. This stipulation
<br />
is entirely empirical. Secondly, chemistry as a material substrate of
<br />
biology is also empirical in bridging the present progressive and the
<br />
present perfect tense. Chemical reaction is about the process of updating
<br />
the reactants once registered in the present perfect tense again through
<br />
their resurrection in the movement in progressive. Chemistry practices
<br />
quantum mechanics so that the material record registered in the present
<br />
perfect tense may constantly be updated. One outcome would be to return
<br />
products in the downstream again back into reactants in the upstream, as
<br />
letting the whole reaction scheme circular.　Once the robust closure of
<br />
chemical reactions is formed, it could be settled also in the biological
<br />
organization.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the branching of one world off into many happens to generate a strange
<br />
world almost similar to the one branched off previously, that strange one
<br />
could be retained and entrapped in a closure. This would make our physical
<br />
universe quite biological. Still, another outrageous picture?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
