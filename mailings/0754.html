<p>
Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>Following our discussion of the inadequacies of the current 
<br />
hypothesis on Cosmic Evolution on May 4, 2002, we posed a list of 
<br />
questions concerning the fundamental scientific issues  relating to 
<br />
the emergence of complexity.  During these discussions, we recognized 
<br />
that different individuals were proposing different concepts of time, 
<br />
matter, space and identity. The WESSbook sessions of June 8, 2002 and 
<br />
September 21, 2002 have revealed basic distinctions among our views.
<br />
<p>We will continue this series of explorations on October 12, 2002. 
<br />
The meeting will be begin at 12:00 PM in room 284 of the Reiss 
<br />
Science Building on the Georgetown University campus.  This session 
<br />
will be an &quot;open mike&quot; session for all participants under the 
<br />
guidelines given below.
<br />
<p>Volunteers are sought to give presentations on current views of this 
<br />
important metaphysical question.
<br />
<p>The session will be divided into two parts, Early and Late.
<br />
<p>Volunteers for the &quot;Early&quot; part are requested to submit a title and 
<br />
several sentences describing their hypothesis on the nature of space. 
<br />
We hope to have three of four individuals from three or four 
<br />
different disciplines who can give substantial presentations on their 
<br />
views.
<br />
<p>&quot;Late&quot; speakers are invited to submit an email, including a proposed 
<br />
title, documenting their desire to comment on the views of the 
<br />
&quot;Early&quot; speakers or to briefly develop another perspective of time.
<br />
<p>Free discussion will follow the early and late speakers.
<br />
<p>Please volunteer at your earliest convenience. In order to schedule 
<br />
an orderly meeting and to notify other WESSbook participants, it is 
<br />
necessary to receive your title no later than Saturday, October 5th, 
<br />
2002.
<br />
<p>We will partition the available time democratically between the 
<br />
longer and the shorter talks.
<br />
<p>An open question:  Should we consider future WESSbook sessions on 
<br />
other fundamental issues related to the circumstances of the 
<br />
emergence of complexity, such as: The Nature of Identity, The Nature 
<br />
of Mind, The Nature of Energy, or Nature of Logic?
<br />
<p>This question is asked because WESS has been invited to present a 
<br />
session at a Symposium being organized by the Washington Academy of 
<br />
Sciences. The Washington Academy of Sciences symposium will be held 
<br />
in March, 2004.  The symposium would provide WESS members to present 
<br />
their views to a wider audience.
<br />
<p>Your comments on this proposal on the nature of space and the 
<br />
potential for participation in the Washington Academy of Sciences 
<br />
symposium are welcomed.
<br />
<p>The volume of literature on nature of space is huge.  If you would 
<br />
like guidance on relevant works on the nature of space relevant to 
<br />
this WESSbook meeting, please call.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
