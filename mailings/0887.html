<p><p>Hi elohim
<br />
I would just like to emphasize the role of interactions. Remember that 
<br />
because our language by design thinks in terms of things, we are thereby 
<br />
led to really believe in these things, as if they were really real. But 
<br />
systemics is about the interactionings that are happening in the present 
<br />
Now. Can anything that isn't happening now be considered real?
<br />
<p>I think that once we put the situation in terms of interactionings, and 
<br />
that means mutual interactions, the falsehoods of what has been said will 
<br />
become obvious.
<br />
Systems can be self correcting. Call it positive or negative feedback if 
<br />
you want, because there is a relationship between the members of the 
<br />
system, the system emergents can evolve efficiently.
<br />
<p>Until the sides come together, there will be no interaction to be corrected...
<br />
<p>I know there is a BIG system at work here, call it whatever you want. 
<br />
Because systems integrate rather than add, clearly systems will integrate 
<br />
together until finally there is but one WHOLE system. There is already one 
<br />
whole system. At the very beginning there was One WHOLE which divided 
<br />
systemically. The Universe found one way that would work, and has been 
<br />
using that one way and variations of it ever since and look we are the 
<br />
result of that simple act of creativity.
<br />
No, let me say it right, that simplest act of creativity.
<br />
<p>I think about the wars we have had.  The millions of people who have died. 
<br />
Millions of children from both sides. Why would any &quot;system&quot; allow this? 
<br />
Some say there is no &quot;system&quot; and we are on our own.  If we are, as some 
<br />
have said, &quot;souls with a body, and not bodies with a soul&quot; then this life 
<br />
on earth is like a learning experience. Some say that we have to come here 
<br />
in order to learn. Some have more to learn than others. Maybe the children 
<br />
that died through no fault of their own didn't have so much to learn. That 
<br />
would lead to the unsettling conclusion that our life is just a stepping 
<br />
stone, and when we die, we go back to where we were before we were born, 
<br />
but on a new level. Unsettling because it would then be clear that those 
<br />
who die have the advantage...
<br />
Ultimately
<br />
<p>tom
