<p>
Firstly. Thank you for inviting me to join the list. I have been
<br />
reviewing the list's archives and discovered many exciting discussions.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
To the point at hand. I have a number of concerns regarding the
<br />
feasibility of using of labeled bipartite graphs to describe molecules
<br />
(or molecular information depending on how I read Jerry) - it may be
<br />
simple but it is inaccurate even for small molecules. First,
<br />
constraining graphs to be bipartite is too restrictive since many
<br />
molecular structures are unrepresentable as graphs under this schema
<br />
(e.g. cyclopentane). This is probably true for any k-partite (layered)
<br />
schema. So we might merely require labeled undirected graphs be used.
<br />
But this also has shortcomings. It ignores, as John Collier as already
<br />
pointed out, the importance of bond strength and type. The water
<br />
molecule, for instance, is not a permanent structure. It is subject to
<br />
protonation/deprotonation processes with a residence time of the order
<br />
of milliseconds. Further the interaction of water molecules (hydrogen
<br />
bonding) gives rise to the interesting the macro properties of water
<br />
which would not occur due to sigma bonds alone. Perhaps, then we might
<br />
introduce bond representation in the form of weighted edges and move
<br />
from labeled graphs to labeled networks. But major problem still exists
<br />
and it is in the use of labels. Labels here are made to do a lot of work
<br />
All the properties that distinguish an atom from other atoms are bundled
<br />
into labels. Consider Carbon Tetrachloride and Silicon Tetrachloride
<br />
which are both tetrahedral in structure (in this case capable of being
<br />
represented by a labeled bipartite graph) with the distinguishing atom
<br />
at the centre. SiCl4 is soluble in water whereas CCl4 isn't (because the
<br />
C atom is smaller than Si, the Cl atoms effectively shield the C atom
<br />
from the hydrolysis reaction). One may say that the intrinsic
<br />
information in each molecule is the same however if we limit ourselves
<br />
solely to this level of information in isolation we will never construct
<br />
a robust information theory of chemistry or biology. A general account
<br />
of information is required which incorporates notions such as
<br />
distinguishability and interaction. I am confident group theory can
<br />
provide this. The structure of a mathematical object need CAN represent
<br />
the relations among or correspond to the structure of a natural object
<br />
but not using graphs alone. 
<br />

An Open Comment: 
<br />
You ask &quot;why&quot;? 
<br />
Because the simplest possible mathematical representation of a 
<br />
chemical molecule is a labeled bipartite graph. 
<br />
JDC: It seems to me that there is a lot that leaves out with respect 
<br />
to relative energy levels, structure of non-ioniv bonds, and other 
<br />
things. Scott's a physical chemist by original training, and is not 
<br />
insensitive to the importance of these things. 
<br />
JLRC: Yes. Chemical attributes are either deduced from the 
<br />
structure or measured. If you re-read my post carefully you may wish 
<br />
to reflect on the relation to denotation. 
<br />
And, because the structure of a mathematical object need not 
<br />
represent the relations among or correspond to the structure of 
<br />
natural object. 
<br />
JDC: Part of the subtlety of Scott's treatment is that he has 
<br />
developed a way to test whether or not this is true for specific 
<br />
mathematical objects and specific physical states for which we can 
<br />
have evidence. Jaynes argues for the ambiguity of information content 
<br />
because of multiple accurate descriptions. Scott shows that Jaynes' 
<br />
argument is flawed beecase there is a general way to overcome the 
<br />
ambiguity problem. We still need evidence of the structure, of 
<br />
course, and we may well not be clever enough to come up with an 
<br />
accurate description of this evidence. 
<br />
JLRC: My original post consisted of comments about chemistry and 
<br />
mathematics. At issue are the relations between chemical objects, 
<br />
physical objects and mathematical objects. A labelled bipartite 
<br />
graph is not ambiguous as a chemical structure. If life itself were 
<br />
simply a trivial extension of well known physical and mathematical 
<br />
principles, these positions and statements would be superfluous, 
<br />
nicht wahr? 
<br />
I conclude that the languages and structures of natural systems are 
<br />
vastly richer than I was able to state or imagine. 
<br />
Cheers 
<br />
