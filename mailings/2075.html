Reacting to Pedro's nail story, I have traditional story from Norway.  A
<br />
person positioned him/herself on a well-used highway, and made a fire to
<br />
boil some soup.  This person put into the water a nail, promising to make a
<br />
very delicious soup from it -- nail soup.  As people went by carrying
<br />
different things, (s)he begged them to leave a little piece of whatever
<br />
edibles they might have in the soup.  So one left a leek, another a fish
<br />
head, a pinch of salt,and so on, and when the soup was done, it was very
<br />
delicious indeed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What accumulated around this nail was variety of ingredients --
<br />
indeed, the soup's informational entropy increased!  This could be
<br />
holistically assessed by taste, which would vary with the amounts of the
<br />
various ingredients.  The infrastructure here is the boiling pot, of
<br />
course, and the infostructure the ingredients, which blended ever more upon
<br />
cooking, become ever more dispersed among the others, achieving eventually
<br />
a fine symmetry of structure.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After the recent exchanges, let me try a possible way to put economic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things in a more clear sense. It could be through the distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;infostructures&quot; and &quot;infrastructures&quot; --the former built up upon our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbolic capabilities, neatly informational, and the latter being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;productive operations that by themselves involve the usual physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attributes and laws (not only entropy growth!). Conversely to Marxian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;views, the infrastructure would be docilely conduced by the infostructure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(with dense feedbacks, of course, and admittedly following too schematic an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach).  The sort of infoeconomic or infodynamic processes governing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material part of the economy involve very familiar terms --eg, value-- that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perhaps we can recast  by some of the ideas argumented here, particularly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by Bob and Igor.  A little story on &quot;the nail found in Zaragoza&quot; may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illuminating...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In a very hot day, walking along the fields surrounding this very place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(CPS, in Zaragoza ouskirts) a student finds a big nail, very old artifact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quite rusted, almost scrap. Its value: just as scrap iron, merely around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one cent ---if any of the recycling companies could be interested buying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it. However the student is curious, and takes the nail in order to show it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to some historians. It looks interesting: its manufacture is genuinely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;medieval, it bears some marks or signs , etc. The value now ascends: one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hundred euros are offered by these new interested parties. Well, an erudite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;archeologist intervenes: those marks are inscriptions that can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deciphered and become latin &amp; french anagrams, and who knows why, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nail is starting to attract big media coverage--- journalists, local
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;museum, collectors, etc. Now all these new social networks which have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;altered are escalating the value to several thousand euros. Unbelievable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but the most reputed erudite of this region (Aragon) reports that the nail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself belongs to... Roldan and Charlemagne themselves!!! To their joint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;war-chariot, in their frustrated siege of Moorish Zaragoza millennia ago).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Big, big hysteria: regional and national politicians, journalists and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;novelists, all of Spanish and French Media, numerous TVs, Academies,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;European museums, Hollywood producers,  treasure hunters.... The value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emanating from the massive perturbation of a terrific number of flickering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social networks (&quot;disrupted bonds&quot;) is taking the value now to the millions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Helas, as it frequently happens, it was an elaborated fake. Big scandal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dense silence. The nail returns to the one cent value ---end of the story
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(it literally happened in a museum in Israel, cheated around a King
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Salomon's artifact, priced around one million--the source of my little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;story on the nail).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sorry for the bla, bla, bla, and for conflating notions of value and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;price. I just wanted to argue on the need to explore the info nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;value, reconceptualzed as &quot;ascendancy&quot; derived from the activation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multidimensional networks, being symbolically proyected onto a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cardinality, and then becoming &quot;prized&quot;. Yes, it deals with a single event,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but when we regiment in markets and accounting systems all the regularity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of social production systems, we keep a strong record of the social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ascendancy of all the parties and processes involved (eg, look at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enigmatic valuation of &quot;art works&quot; --the most expensive items of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;societies). It is along similar lines, I think, that we might re-enter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notions of social entropy and other new ways of analysis, and not literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as attempted in the present way by some.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We are here, in this list, playing with several important pieces of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knolwedge, from different individual sources, that we must massage and put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;together with a lot of patience and common sense. It might be finally a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nicer story than the unfortunate &quot;nail found in Zaragoza&quot;
</em><br />
_______________
<br />
<p>Loet said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps, we can use the mathematical theory of communication for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding cultural phenomena, but only if we are able to free it from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its physical (thermodynamic) and biological (Darwinian) connotations. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems have to be specified at the systems level relevant to the research
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question and then some math can sometimes be imported from other relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sciences.
</em><br />
<p>SS: As I see it, the mathematical theory of communication (Shannon entropy
<br />
= information carrying capacity) was freed from its physical connotations
<br />
by Shannon &amp; Weaver by removing certain constraints from the Boltzmann
<br />
model of physical entropy.  That is, the Shannon equation regarding variety
<br />
is a generalization of the Boltzmann equation regarding disorder (of
<br />
particles in a field).  Thus freed, it can be applied to any field
<br />
containing an assessable amount of variety.  The Darwinian connotation
<br />
(given in Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection) is that the
<br />
greater the variety of some field, the more rapidly it can evolve into a
<br />
simpler field, becoming thereby more specialized with respect to some
<br />
aspect of the environment surrounding the field.  Both of these ideas are
<br />
general enough to be applied to any discipline or example where variety can
<br />
be assessed.

Pedro, in a complex message on Friday, said (among many other things):
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Several parties in this list have advocated systemic views (Stan a number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of times!, Jerry also produced a vast systemic scheme). However, arguing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seriously about systems theory, after the pioneering views of von
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bertalanffy in the 60's, very little has been produced under the guidance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of that school, and I really contend that, concerning the integration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem, anything but triviality and self-delusion can be found around the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'level' stuff nowadays.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: If that is true, then, sadly, a number of folks are getting ready
<br />
to waste a lot of time, as the hierarchy / levels approach is attracting
<br />
considerably more interest these days than it had before the mid 90's.  It
<br />
is worth pointing out, erhaps, that levels are established by information,
<br />
which is the topic of the current thread. Relations between levels are
<br />
informational.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, a pressing issue to consider in this tentative revision of social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ascendancy may be that social information is very largely &quot;decoupled&quot; from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy growth (as is biological information itself).
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, social information would be involved in setting up potential
<br />
kinetics to mediate energy flowing through a social system.  Some channels
<br />
for flow may be used in some contexts, others in other contexts.  Some
<br />
kinetics would impose more friction upon energy flow than would others.
<br />
So, I think the term &quot;decoupled&quot; here is dead wrong! My remarks here would
<br />
hold regardless of whether we think of a system as maximizing energy
<br />
throughput or not.  That is, the information -&gt; kinetics connection is
<br />
necessarily true regardless of how one visualizes the global behavior of a
<br />
system.  As well, while it may seem that the intensity of energy flows
<br />
within a social system are unimportant, no materialist could take that
<br />
position.
