Dear John,
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Michael, Rafael A coda on the Popper debate.
</em><br />
&nbsp;Michael commented &quot;I'm merely arguing from experience.&quot; Can we also argue
<br />
'towards' experience?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>Yes, we can, but we can also argue about what we mean when we argue &quot;form&quot;
<br />
or &quot;towards&quot; or... experience. In this case our &quot;faith&quot; positions (and
<br />
everybody has a &quot;faith&quot; as Ortega y Gasset clearly saw when he made the
<br />
difference between &quot;ideas&quot; and &quot;beliefs&quot; (ideas/creeencias): &quot;ideas&quot; being
<br />
the necessary expression of a situation in which our &quot;beliefs&quot; are coming
<br />
into a crisis (and they are always in a potential trouble...). This is the
<br />
case of &quot;paradigm shifts&quot; (Kuhn) and of &quot;no absolute knowledge&quot; (or
<br />
tentative knowledge) in the case of Popper. When we talk about our beliefs
<br />
we do not do science but also not metaphysics (i.e. we do not make
<br />
declarations of faith even not on the theses of &quot;tentative knowledge&quot; or
<br />
whatever, but we are moving in an open field we use to call philosophy in
<br />
our Western tradition...
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems one possible way out of the 'two cultures' impasse is to  ground
</em><br />
our notion of 'information' on a vastly expanded conception of 'experience'
<br />
as 'Erlebnis' 'Erfahrung' and 'Experimentation' - embracing aesthetic or
<br />
religious experience, methodical 'trial and error', our daily lived
<br />
experiences as well as the adaptive incurrences of  molecular life
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I think that the &quot;two cultures&quot; debate is a naive simplification of the
<br />
complexity of human experience(s) and language(s), on the basis of the no
<br />
less complex biological system that &quot;supports&quot; such complexity.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if we take a 'third way' and avoid the route which leads either to
</em><br />
reductionist scientism ('the scientific rage to make everything objective
<br />
and verifiable' ) or to the speculative philosophising of our latter-day
<br />
culture gurus?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>If we give up the &quot;two ways&quot; then we don't need a &quot;third&quot; one. Scientific
<br />
(and philosophic) reductionisms are the heritage of religious dogmatism...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if we consider the Aristotle-Bacon-Hegel-Peirce-Dilthey-Merleau
</em><br />
Ponty-Gadamer line grounded on an historical notion of 'experience' of
<br />
which 'information' is the essential dynamic? Reactive and proactive
<br />
abduction rather than syllogistic induction/deduction becomes the source
<br />
from which both art and science spring (what Steven Ericsson has called
<br />
'the primitives of experience')?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Yes, I agree with you that the notion of experience is a historical one in a
<br />
double sense of the word: it is historical as it is a product of natural AND
<br />
social evolution. In this sense, also religious experience as well as art
<br />
and science belong to the richness of human experience (as stated also by
<br />
Einstein and many other natural sicentists, as you know
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this scenario 'information' can be broadly defined as 'any experience
</em><br />
which runs counter to an expectation' and provides the Ariadne thread
<br />
linking apparently disparate concepts of 'information' discussed in this
<br />
&nbsp;forum over the years e.g.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
yes, I think that the connection between experience and expectation (if we
<br />
take this concept in a broad sense including also structures of material
<br />
processes as well as biological processes, and, of course, social processes)
<br />
is a key issue. I use Luhmann's difference between &quot;sense offer&quot; and
<br />
&quot;information&quot; in order to distinguish different kinds of selections that
<br />
take place in the process(es) of communication. A &quot;meaning offer&quot; (or &quot;sense
<br />
offer&quot;) is given through the presentation of a message, out of which the
<br />
receiver selects one possible meaning, this last process being called
<br />
information. The integration of this meaning within the background of the
<br />
system is called &quot;understanding&quot; and the unity of these three moments is
<br />
called &quot;communication&quot;. What I try to stress is the difference between
<br />
&quot;message&quot; and &quot;information&quot;. While we have (in the social sciences and
<br />
humanities) many theories concerning the selection of meaning out of a given
<br />
(!) text, which we call &quot;hermeneutics&quot; (or theory of interpretation) and
<br />
although we also have &quot;media theories&quot; concerning the (material) support for
<br />
messages, we do not have a well developped theory of messages. Calling back
<br />
the Greek word for message which is &quot;angelia&quot; I created a neologism (similar
<br />
to logos/logic), and I call this message theory &quot;angeletics&quot; which is not a
<br />
&quot;theory of angels&quot; (no less than chemistry is identical to alchemy...)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Shannon entropy/surprise; Wiener's negentropy;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gregory Bateson 'a difference that makes a difference' and his
</em><br />
Shakespearean 'nothing comes of nothing - speak again';
<br />
Gadamer 'negative dialectic of experience';
<br />
Keats' negative capability' ('when a man is capable of being in
<br />
uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact
<br />
and reason')
<br />
&nbsp;Peirce: abductive hypothesis framing;
<br />
&nbsp;Varela/Maturana: autopoiesis
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
in some way these authors point to the fact that it is not possible to
<br />
determine which will be the choice/interpretation of the &quot;receiver&quot; out of a
<br />
given message. But also the sender of a message has to make herself a
<br />
choice. The &quot;mystery&quot; is (at the social level) why we &quot;believe&quot; (!!) in this
<br />
message less than in that other one. Which are the conditions of possibility
<br />
for the credibility of messages (to put it in a Kantian terminology). For
<br />
instance for empirical science this could be a certain concept of
<br />
experience...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Experience is, in a certain sense, irreducible. There is the need to put
</em><br />
human life back into science &quot; Evan Thompson
<br />
Cybersemiotics: &quot;My view is that certainly life and mind (first person
<br />
experiences) emerge within the evolution of the universe.&quot; (Soren Brier)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>yes, this is a &quot;credo&quot;... and a &quot;message&quot; at the same time...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To predicate 'information' on experience rather than on consciousness,
</em><br />
cognition or belief (philosophy), self (psychology/sociology), soul
<br />
(theology) matter/space/time (physics) or the cell (biochemistry) breaks
<br />
down the barrier between science and art
<br />
&nbsp;- 'information' is the catalyst of experience.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>in some way the concept of message is what unifies in some way the different
<br />
experiences and their communication. Probably we are too &quot;modern&quot; not to
<br />
perceive that we are messagers (well this could be a &quot;re-definition of what
<br />
it means to be human..., but not a very clear and definite one) because we
<br />
are capable of getting a special kind of message concerning our own
<br />
being/existence. This is called in the classical philosophical terminology:
<br />
selfawareness, where &quot;self&quot; is not the &quot;ego&quot; but the vey situation of
<br />
being-in-the-world...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ted Goranson commented recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &lt;I believe nearly all our precedents - our giant minds of the past - fail
</em><br />
us on this &lt;score because they entangle the notions of knowledge and
<br />
insight with information.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This statement should really give us pause.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
maybe because they were aware of this unique capacity not only to be a
<br />
messanger but also to be aware of it...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is no necessary connection between 'information' and cognition
</em><br />
(and the data/information/knowledge hierarchical pyramid is in fact a
<br />
telescoping Sierpinski Gasket) then there are interesting epistemological
<br />
corollaries for the 'information society' and the computing industry.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
there is indeed, I believe, a connection beteen information and
<br />
understanding in the sense of selecting out of a message some possibilities
<br />
of meaning and &quot;integrating&quot; them into our background knowledge (and
<br />
selecting againg from this, sending a new message, concerning what we mean
<br />
out of the message and so on...)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The corollaries of such a paradigm shift for contemporary 'Information
</em><br />
Science' (which is at best a tautology and at worst an oxymoron) are: 1.
<br />
Shannon/Weaver's Mathematical Theory of Communication fired a shot for the
<br />
science of stochastics but may have missed the true nature of 'information'
<br />
&nbsp;or even 'communication'. Attempts over the last thirty years by
<br />
philosophers (Dretske et al)and reductionist science to graft Shannonist
<br />
information  onto a theory of cognition ('semantic information') or a
<br />
materialist  teleology (such as Stonier's infons , Wheeler's IT from BIT,
<br />
Bohm's  implicate order or Floridi's infosphere) have not been conclusive.
<br />
What,  for example, is 'natural information'? Can I touch it? Is it like a
<br />
'natural number' or is it an actual physical entity?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>I think that we (in the social sciences) not only need a media theory and an
<br />
interpretation theory but also a theory of messages (which is empirical,
<br />
historical and... philosophical)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Any Philosophy of Information is entangled with a Philosophy of
</em><br />
Language (in a broader sense than the study of signs or signals, as Gadamer
<br />
has argued)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Pedro,  maybe that debate should be a whole future FIS session in
</em><br />
itself?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>and with a philosophy of messages, which is different from philosophy as a
<br />
message...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both language and 'information' share the property of recursivity - with
</em><br />
grammar and relevance as their respective boundary conditions. Without their
<br />
'noise' scientific communication loses its imagination, its grand analogies
<br />
and hypotheses by which it progresses. Scientific method proceeds not by
<br />
testing and replication alone but by abduction, by imaginative hypothesis
<br />
framing - not just getting the answer to a problem but getting at the real
<br />
problem. This is where the experiential dynamic of 'information' comes into
<br />
play.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
which presupposes, again, the recursivity of messages (not only of
<br />
media/language and information/selection)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At a forthcoming session we could revisit some of these 'philosophical'
</em><br />
issues as playfully as Socrates once toyed with the notion of 'techne'.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>a different 'affair' I believe, since techne is the knowledge of how to
<br />
produce (material) things, this process itself being called &quot;poiesis&quot;.
<br />
Aristotle distinguished techne/poiesis from phronesis/praxis, the last ones
<br />
concerning not the level of material production but of human action (praxis)
<br />
and its specic knowledge (phronesis/prudentia: the capacity of choosing
<br />
means with regards to a good (!) end)
<br />
<p>sorry for the long comments and also for my English
<br />
