<p>
This message is the first part of three, following the suggestion 
<br />
that every message must be relatively short in order to facilitate 
<br />
its acceptance.
<br />
<p>Two months ago  Andy Hilgartner &lt;cah5&#64;hilgart.org&gt; sent a message to 
<br />
bertalanffy-list saying &quot;I don't see significant numbers of people 
<br />
discussing what I regard as the key issue posed by the obsession of 
<br />
Mr. Bush and his cabal with annihilating the Iraqi people. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wrote a little essay of my own, telling how it looks to 
<br />
me.&quot;
<br />
<p>His essay (°) in my view confirms that most humans (comprised several 
<br />
researchers, experts and scholars engaged in dealing scientifically 
<br />
with systems, cybernetics, information, organization and human 
<br />
nature) have been unable to develop the necessary abilities for 
<br />
recognizing holistically the causality of the problems that are 
<br />
seriously disrupting the perspective of humankind. A perspective that 
<br />
might be considered by definition as an humanitarian one, therefore 
<br />
ethically, ethologically, biologically and ecologically oriented
<br />
<p>Learning to approach holistically the surrounding reality - as A. 
<br />
Hilgartner has shown in his essay - is an ability that everyone must 
<br />
learn on his or her own, trying to avoid being distracted and even 
<br />
deviated by particular details and even by symptoms of what can be 
<br />
considered the serious illness that suffers humankind. It seems that 
<br />
inevitably the scientific community as a whole, being excepted only 
<br />
individual endeavors, has not yet been able to recognize how the 
<br />
scientific research is usually dealing with fragments of the reality 
<br />
in order to pragmatically produce profitable technological and 
<br />
methodological innovations. Those that are considered worthy if they 
<br />
are  oriented by the kind of investments and business that prevail in 
<br />
practice all over the world
<br />
<p>Therefore the big question for the humans willing to increase the 
<br />
survival chances of our species might be: How might we encourage 
<br />
ourselves to comprehend holistically (*) the problems that are 
<br />
disrupting the social, economic and cultural possibilities of the 
<br />
human societies?
<br />
<p>(*) to recognize clearly the forest before trying to cure one or 
<br />
another of the infected trees
<br />
<p>(*)  to employ the TOP ==&gt; Down approach for learning to comprehend 
<br />
the question to deal with, being it identifies as an open system = a 
<br />
system that must take care of its environment.
<br />
<p>The answer is an urgent requirement indispensable for trying to save 
<br />
the human life from the man-made apocalypse that has been de facto 
<br />
rationally organized - through narrow minded and short sighted 
<br />
assumptions - by arrogant humans surrounded by opportunistic 
<br />
accomplices and not few resigned scientists motivated exclusively to 
<br />
get some additional funds offered for the progress of obedient, 
<br />
disciplined and adaptable humans who must dogmatically believe in the 
<br />
magical powers of pre-emptive wars (*) and free marketing (#)
<br />
<p>(*) those organized nowadays by means of terrorism supported by super 
<br />
technologically modernized weapons in order to assure a humanitarian 
<br />
and effective genocide that might help to reduce faster the number of 
<br />
complaining and useless individuals = people who are already 
<br />
unemployed (and also their relatives)
<br />
<p>(#) trade that will increase the economic power of those who are 
<br />
willing courageously to train themselves as  compassionate 
<br />
philanthropists, though not immediately as proper (?) circumstances 
<br />
must be created in advance
<br />
<p>(°) the second part of this message will be posted later.
