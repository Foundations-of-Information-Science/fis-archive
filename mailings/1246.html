<br />
<p>Abstract
<br />
Biosemiotics allows us thus to use three types of causality:
<br />
1 Efficient, 2.Formal and 3.Final.
<br />
1.      Efficient causality works through the transfer of energy and is 
<br />
quantitatively measurable.
<br />
2.      Formal causality works through &#x201d;pattern recognition  and coding&#x201d;, 
<br />
and with signals of information in a dualistic protosemiotic matter. 
<br />
Molecules are coded, and interact through formal causality.
<br />
3.      Final causation is semiotic signification and interprertation and. 
<br />
It is dependant on awareness, subjectivity and intensionality. Cells 
<br />
interprete the coded molecules as signs through final causation. Cells are 
<br />
the fundamental biosemiotic subjects.
<br />
<p>Peirce&#x2019;s sees mind as a basic part of reality (as qualia and pure emotion 
<br />
in Firstness), existing as the inner aspect of the material aspect of 
<br />
reality (in Secondness). Emotion and awarenes is the &#x2018;inner aspect of 
<br />
matter&#x2019; (a view called &#x2018;hylozoism&#x2019;) manifesting itself as awareness and 
<br />
experience in animals, and, finally, as consciousness in humans.
<br />
<p>Combining this with a general systems theory of emergence, 
<br />
self-organization and closure/autopoiesis, it constitutes an explicit 
<br />
theory of how the inner world of organism is constituted in evolution, and, 
<br />
therefore, how first persons views, and thereby the establishment of 
<br />
interpretants, is possible. No other present modern theory can do that to 
<br />
my knowledge.
<br />
<p><p>Introduction
<br />
<p>Today, cybernetic information science inform also by general systems theory 
<br />
on one hand and one the other semiotics, are the two most transdisciplinary 
<br />
paradigms offering evolutionary theories of organization, 
<br />
self-organization, life, intelligence and meaning..
<br />
Semiotics begins with the process of knowledge: how signification occurs 
<br />
within living systems, making perception and cognition possible. Charles 
<br />
Sanders Peirce&#x2019;s semiotics unites our explanatory schemes of deduction and 
<br />
induction through abduction within the process of semiosis. Peirce suggests 
<br />
that we consider triadic semiosis as the fundamental process of reality. 
<br />
But  as Wildgen (2001, p.175) writes: &#x201c;If we adopt a triadic structure 
<br />
underlying sign-usage, we chose the most plausible one, but a definition of 
<br />
the sign cannot be used as an a priori statement from which an ontology can 
<br />
be derived. We can only accumulate evolutionary, cognitive, sociological 
<br />
arguments in favor of such a stratification.&#x201d;  This is then what Peirce and 
<br />
the modern development of his theory as biosemiotics does. Biosemiotics 
<br />
acknowledge that semiosis is an essential part of all living systems and 
<br />
should encompass the study of sign games of all living systems. But here, 
<br />
as in mechanism and pan-informationalism the problem of how far the 
<br />
explanation should go arises: can we move to a pan-semiotic view without 
<br />
wanting to explain too much? I believe we cannot since there are limits to 
<br />
scientific explanations. I have in short form argued (Brier 2002a) that it 
<br />
would be more fruitful to accept this and work with five different levels 
<br />
of interaction in nature, without assuming any evolutionary causal links 
<br />
between them that would indicate that one level is presumed to give rise to 
<br />
the other, or presuming any linear causality. (See Johansson&#x2019;s 2001 
<br />
discussion of supervenience principles):
<br />
1.      A non-manifest level with hypercomplex or chaotic interactions. The 
<br />
concept of vacuum in Quantum field theory is one attempt by science to 
<br />
describe this state, albeit without a synechistic frame.
<br />
2.      An energy level with energy-based causal interaction by natural 
<br />
forces.
<br />
3.      An informational level with signal and/or code causality.
<br />
4.      Semiotic level with sign-game-causality within and between living 
<br />
systems.
<br />
5.      A linguistic level with language-game-causality based on meaning 
<br />
between conscious social systems.
<br />
So, 1. is a transcendental level, 2. the physical, 3. the chemical, 4. the 
<br />
organic  and psychological and 5 the social objective knowledge to relate 
<br />
to Hartmann&#x2019;s hierarchy. This is just a short preliminary statement to tell 
<br />
the reader which frame of reference I am coming from. Further argumentation 
<br />
can be found in Brier (2003).
<br />
<p><p>Critique of current approaches
<br />
<p>Descriptions of these levels did exist in different areas of modern 
<br />
science, but they have never been brought together into one theoretical or 
<br />
paradigmatic framework.  Mainstream eliminative mechanistic science tries 
<br />
to accomplish this, but it has an insufficient philosophical background. 
<br />
More precisely, past and present attempts at unification have all had 
<br />
problems and inconsistencies:
<br />
1.      Although the classical mechanistic physics could mathematically 
<br />
describe certain connections, forces, and regularities in nature, and 
<br />
describe -- with the help of quantum mechanics -- the stability of matter, 
<br />
it is very difficult to think of evolution from within a mechanistic 
<br />
worldview with its rigid deterministic universal laws and Newtonian 
<br />
reversible time (Prigogine and Stengers 1984).
<br />
2.      This is resolved by the thermodynamic atomistic view, which is 
<br />
based on complexity, self-organizing dissipative structures, and 
<br />
irreversible time. But it is still difficult to understand how information 
<br />
and cognition can arise and self-organize from pure physical matter and 
<br />
energy (Brier 1992).
<br />
3.      In the pan-informational paradigm, information as organizing power 
<br />
is present from the beginning. This makes self-organization and the 
<br />
emergence of cognition more understandable, especially when it is framed by 
<br />
a general systems theory with an organismic and emergent evolutionary 
<br />
worldview. But it is difficult to understand how living systems can emerge 
<br />
as individual beings, how they treat information differently from 
<br />
mechanical cybernetic systems, and what the special qualities of the 
<br />
semiotic creativity of self-conscious linguistic embodied beings (Brier 
<br />
1992, 2003) are.
<br />
4.      In second-order cybernetics and autopoiesis theory, the idea of 
<br />
closure on biological, psychological, and social communicative levels, as 
<br />
explained by the concept of autopoiesis (self-organizing, self-maintaining, 
<br />
and self-producing abilities), clarifies the special self-preserving 
<br />
ability and cognition as well as an individualistic point of view. This 
<br />
conception -- especially as elucidated by Maturana and Varela and also von 
<br />
Foerster -- has similarities with Uexküll&#x2019;s Umweltslehre. It is a type of 
<br />
bio-constructivism. Unfortunately it tends to be rather idealistic, even 
<br />
solipsistic in certain formulations, while at the same time insisting on 
<br />
the material reality of a biological observing system. Uexküll was a 
<br />
declared vitalist who saw living systems as species, stretching the Umwelt 
<br />
bauplans through time eternal. He is, in short, an anti-Darwinist. But the 
<br />
founding father of modern ethology Konrad Lorenz uses elements of Uexküll&#x2019;s 
<br />
theory to create the ethological paradigm, fits them into a neo-Darwinian 
<br />
paradigm. He then struggles to integrate feeling and signification, based 
<br />
on qualia and meaning, into his description, in the end failing to 
<br />
establish a theory encompassing both the phenomenological and the 
<br />
scientific aspects of animal cognition and communication (Brier  2001).
<br />
5.      In Peircian semiotic philosophy, these levels can be bound together 
<br />
by Synechism, Tychism, and Agapism, combined with an evolutionary view of 
<br />
the interactions between Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. The view of 
<br />
Firstness as a blend of qualities of mind and matter containing qualia and 
<br />
living feeling and a tendency to form habits, is crucial for understanding 
<br />
the self-organizing capabilities of nature and how what seems to be &#x201c;dead&#x201d; 
<br />
matter can, through evolutionary self-organization, become autopoietic and 
<br />
alive with cognitive/semiotic and feeling abilities. Ever since Umberto Eco 
<br />
(1976) formulated the problem of the &#x201c;semiotic threshold,&#x201d; semiotics -- 
<br />
especially Peircian semiotics -- has developed further into the realm of 
<br />
biology Concepts of the closure, self-organization, and differentiation of 
<br />
biological, psychological, and social systems developed in second-order 
<br />
cybernetics and autopoiesis theory need to be integrated into theories of 
<br />
embodiment (Brier 2001,2003).
<br />
The essential question for the current debate about the possibility of a 
<br />
transdisciplinary information/signification science is whether the 
<br />
biosemiotic Peircian framework that includes and reformulates Uexküll&#x2019;s 
<br />
theoretical biology can comprise un-interpreted &#x201c;natural objects,&#x201d; 
<br />
autocatalytic and dissipative structures, and other spontaneous generations 
<br />
of order and patterns in nature as signs. These objects were previously 
<br />
described in physico-chemical terms.
<br />
Adherents of the pan-informational paradigm, such as Stonier (1997), want 
<br />
to explain them in purely informational terms.From a Peircian view, these 
<br />
phenomena are protosemiotic, or quasi-semiotic, when compared to the 
<br />
semiosis of living systems because they are only displays of Secondness 
<br />
(Nöth 2002). That is not the discussion of whether any natural thing can 
<br />
become a sign when placed in a meaningful context by a living system, but 
<br />
if the objects and their processes are signs per se.
<br />
A similar question, to one of objects are signs in themselves, is, what do 
<br />
machines, such as computers, process when no humans are interpreting them. 
<br />
Are these signs or just signals? We know that we codify these signals so 
<br />
that they carry meaning for us in our context; therefore they are signs to 
<br />
us, and forwarding that sign&#x2019;s meaning through a pragmatic view is what 
<br />
they do. But does this not have to occur in a living context where meaning 
<br />
has already been introduced through the embodied mind&#x2019;s existence? Relating 
<br />
to the question of the semioticity of calculating machine, Nöth explains 
<br />
how Peirce coined the term &#x201c;quasi-semiosis&#x201d; to deal with this problem:
<br />
The term quasi-sign suggests an answer to the question whether there can be 
<br />
semiosis in a machine of the kind which Peirce knew. A quasi-sign is only 
<br />
in certain respects like a sign, but it does not fulfill all criteria of 
<br />
semiosis. While some criteria of semiosis may be present in machines, 
<br />
others are missing. The concept of quasi-sign thus suggests degrees of 
<br />
semioticity. Quasi-semiosis does not only begin with calculating machines. 
<br />
It can be found in processes in which much simpler instruments are involved.
<br />
(Nöth 2002: 8)
<br />
Peirce did not believe in the strict dualist separation of mind and matter. 
<br />
His concept of mind is extremely broad and does not necessarily include 
<br />
consciousness or intentionality, only goal-directedness. Following Nöth, 
<br />
the use of the term quasi-semiosis to designate &#x201c;degenerated&#x201d; semiosis near 
<br />
the shift between Secondness in machines and Thirdness in biosemiotic sign 
<br />
games stems primarily from a lack of a triadic object relation:
<br />
Evidence of the quasi-semiotic nature of data processing comes from the 
<br />
dyadic nature of the signs involved. The view that sign processing in 
<br />
computers is based on dyadic relationships is implicit in a widely held 
<br />
theory, which states that computers can only process signals&#x2026;, i.e., 
<br />
mechanical stimuli followed by automatic reactions&#x2026;. What is missing for 
<br />
these signs to develop from dyadic to triadic signs is an object 
<br />
relationship. The dyadic relations are merely dyadic relations of 
<br />
signification, but there is no denotation, no &#x201c;window to the world&#x201d; which 
<br />
allows to relate the sign to an object of experience. &#x2026; the messages 
<br />
produced by a computer in the interface of humans and machines are either 
<br />
messages conveyed by a human sender and mediated by the computer or they 
<br />
are quasi-signs resulting from an automatic and deterministic extension of 
<br />
human semiosis
<br />
(Nöth 2002: 9).
<br />
This brings us back to cybernetics, especially that of Bateson. Here, 
<br />
information is a difference that makes a difference for a cybernetically 
<br />
defined &#x201c;mind.&#x201d; This mind works primarily on differences with feedback 
<br />
loops based on energy. The energy is not important for the coding process 
<br />
per se but the critique of the cybernetic concept of information and 
<br />
meaning has underlined that this type of system, based on information 
<br />
theory, is functionalistic and not capable of encompassing meaning within a 
<br />
biological, not to mention human, perspective. Even Luhmann&#x2019;s idea of 
<br />
meaning as an overabundance of possibilities filtered by some sort of 
<br />
selective mechanism does not relate to the individual existential part of 
<br />
meaning. The discrepancies between these two transdisciplinary paradigms of 
<br />
information and signification stem from the fact that their theories of 
<br />
messages originate on opposite ends of the continuum between science and 
<br />
the humanities.
