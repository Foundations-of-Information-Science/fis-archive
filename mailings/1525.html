Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>I will seek to address, from a very narrow focus, Michel concerns.
<br />
<p>( I will approach the topic from a mathematical  and biosemiotic perspective.)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;of order or disorder, apart from &quot;entropy is disorder&quot; ?
</em><br />
<p>I will start my ad hoc comments with linguistic concepts, move on to the 
<br />
intertwining of linguistic and  mathematical concepts and then to the 
<br />
intertwining of mathematical and chemical concepts and close with 
<br />
philosophical concepts.
<br />
<p>The English word &quot;order&quot; according to OED is derived from Latin,
<br />
ordin, ordo, -- row, series, course, array, rank, class, degree;
<br />
related to ordiri, begin
<br />
<p>&quot;disorder&quot; -- lack of order or regular arrangement.
<br />
<p>The concept of &quot;order&quot; plays a central role in mathematics.
<br />
<p>Note that English synonyms of order are the names of advanced concepts in 
<br />
mathematics, particularly algebra.   For example, the group structure of 
<br />
polynomials is displayed as an array.
<br />
<p>Note that the terms &quot;order&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; are not opposites in the 
<br />
mathematical sense.
<br />
If one wishes to express the opposite of the concept of &quot;order&quot; then, in 
<br />
English, the term is the negation, &quot;not ordered&quot;.  The concept of &quot;not 
<br />
ordered&quot; is synonymous with chaos in the mathematical sense of J. Yorke.
<br />
<p>The concept of order is very deep, both mathematically and 
<br />
philosophically.  Literally hundreds of definitions and theorems of 
<br />
mathematics relate to the concept of order.  In the context of usage, order 
<br />
could be viewed as any system that meets the definition or axiom.  Disorder 
<br />
could be failure to agree with one or more of the definitions or 
<br />
axioms.   Thus, what is &quot;order&quot; in one mathematical context is &quot;disorder&quot; 
<br />
in another context because of the structure of mathematical logic.
<br />
<p>Order is central to the foundations of mathematics.
<br />
<p>Set theory is one foundation of mathematics.  An abstract concept of order 
<br />
enters set theory via  the &quot;well - ordered axiom.&quot;  One expression of this 
<br />
axiom ( Stoll, Set Theory and Logic, 1961) states:
<br />
<p>&quot;a well ordered set is a partially ordered set such that each non-empty 
<br />
subset has a least or first element.&quot;
<br />
<p>[[ Contrast this statement of a mathematical concept with the simplicity of 
<br />
&quot;time's arrow&quot;!]]
<br />
<p>The concept of order also lies at the heart of practical mathematics in the 
<br />
concepts of arithmetic.
<br />
<p>Arithmetic calculations with integers use ordinal numbers (the term ordinal 
<br />
is also derived from the L. ordo.)
<br />
<p>Thus, an essential feature of counting is to organize a set of symbols in 
<br />
an ordinal manner.
<br />
Abstractly, the symbols are merely 'place holders' for the concept of order 
<br />
or sequence.
<br />
<p>But the structure of mathematical order is not restricted to simple regular 
<br />
counting.
<br />
For example, the prime numbers form an increasing sequence.
<br />
But, no simple ordering relations predicts the next prime number!
<br />
<p>Summary view:  The mathematical concept of order has a very elaborate fine 
<br />
structure that permeates virtually all aspects of mathematical discourse.
<br />
<p>Critical notion:
<br />
<p>In mathematics, order has the relation of being anti-symmetric.
<br />
<p>Anti-symmetric, as applied to order, means simply &quot;is greater than&quot; , a 
<br />
comparison of a pair.
<br />
<p>In other words, if one has an ordering relation, then either one term is 
<br />
first and the other is second or vice versa.     (The possibility of 
<br />
&quot;twins&quot; is not permitted; no ties)
<br />
<p>Note that this corresponds readily  with the set theory definition of the 
<br />
existence of a first element of a set.
<br />
<p>Note also that the mathematical concept of anti-symmetry is crisply defined 
<br />
and one can decide based solely on the concept of size, when a relation is 
<br />
anti-symmetric.  ( From the definition above, the concept of size does not 
<br />
enter into the concept of axiom of well ordered sets.)
<br />
<p>Note that the concept of &quot;order&quot; is the parent of a parent of the concept 
<br />
of &quot;anti-symmetry&quot;
<br />
The opposite relation does not hold, that is, anti-symmetry is not the 
<br />
parent of the concept of order
<br />
<p>Note the difference between anti - symmetry and the generic concept of 
<br />
order.    An array is viewed as a relation of order.  For example, a matrix 
<br />
of 3 by 5 is an ordered set because the relation (position) of each of the 
<br />
15 elements of the set of the matrix  (of the arithmetic operation of 
<br />
multiplication of 3 times 5) is  placed in a regular pattern.
<br />
<p>Confusing?  Of  course it is!!!  Logically, several syllogisms derived from 
<br />
the root concept of &quot;order&quot; are related in various chains of sorites, 
<br />
forming a branching, tree like structure of semantic relations.
<br />
Part of the confusion arises from the distinction between the very 
<br />
difficult concept of a &quot;relation&quot; and the simpler (arithmetic) concept of 
<br />
&quot;number&quot;.
<br />
<p><p>Why are these concepts important to FIS discussions of entropy and 
<br />
information?
<br />
<p>Clearly, the concept of &quot;order&quot; and &quot;size&quot; play a critical role in both 
<br />
theories (Shannon and Boltzmann).
<br />
<p>in the mathematical sense of order defined above, chemical semiotics is not 
<br />
based on &quot;order&quot; or &quot;size&quot;.
<br />
<p>Indeed, a molecular structure is not made up from antisymmetric relations 
<br />
of atomic numbers  (nor are anti-symmetric sequences of atomic numbers 
<br />
excluded!)
<br />
<p>What is the relation between &quot;order&quot; and &quot;symmetry&quot; in chemistry and biology?
<br />
<p>Since the mid- 19 th Century discovery of Pasteur, the the concept of 
<br />
symmetry and asymmetry (not &quot;anti-symmetry&quot;)
<br />
have been defined in terms of properties of the whole molecule.  The 
<br />
symmetry or asymmetry of a molecule is a wholistic function of the totality 
<br />
of the organization of the atoms.  The particular species of atoms play 
<br />
only a subsidiary role in the decision logic of chemical symmetry and 
<br />
asymmetry.  In simple terms, atomic numbers (as an ordering relation of 
<br />
abstract numbers) is not the basis of the logical basis of sequences of 
<br />
atoms in molecules.
<br />
<p>My conclusions are both strong and direct:
<br />
<p>The information content of chemical molecules does not correspond with the 
<br />
mathematical concepts of order or size.
<br />
<p>The information content in chemical molecules does not correspond with the 
<br />
mathematical concept of order  because the atomic numbers are the basis of 
<br />
ordering relations in the table of elements but the structure of a molecule 
<br />
is not defined by the either the atomic number of the component elements of 
<br />
the molecule nor the multiset of atomic elements composing the 
<br />
molecule.    (This is simply a fancy way of stating that the concept of 
<br />
&quot;isomers&quot; is a critical logical distinction between the organization of 
<br />
mathematical thought and the organization of chemical thought.  In still 
<br />
other words, Pasteur was right!)
<br />
<p>Also, the information content of chemical molecules does not correspond 
<br />
with the mathematical concepts of size.  If one presupposes that &quot;size&quot; in 
<br />
the mathematical sense corresponds with &quot;information&quot;, then knowledge of 
<br />
the atomic numbers and the multiset of atomic numbers of a molecule would 
<br />
determine the chemical properties and the information content.  No such 
<br />
empirical correspondence exists. Indeed, the opposite empirical information 
<br />
exists.  Chemical molecules of exactly the same (mathematical) size have 
<br />
different chemical properties.  Compounds of the same size (same multiset 
<br />
of atomic numbers)  and with different properties are called isomers.  In 
<br />
simple language, a particular molecular formula may represent a very large 
<br />
number of different isomers, all of the same &quot;size&quot;.
<br />
<p>(In order to avoid a more technical discussion, the two preceding 
<br />
paragraphs neglect to recognize the critical role of ions in 
<br />
chemistry.  Inclusion of the concept of ions would not change the 
<br />
conclusions but would require finer distinctions of meanings and usage with 
<br />
respect to the nature of relationships between atomic number and molecular 
<br />
properties.)
<br />
<p>The concept of biological semiotics can be viewed as an holistic extension 
<br />
of chemical communications.
<br />
&nbsp;From the developments in molecular genetics over the past 50 years, 
<br />
biological semiotics is without doubt, grounded in chemical 
<br />
structures.  Indeed, in many cases, a single molecule with a highly complex 
<br />
structure ( a multiset of atoms organized into one particular isomer) is 
<br />
the critical source of sexual communications between the male and female of 
<br />
a species.   Natural history has chosen one specific molecule from the set 
<br />
of all molecules to act as the specific communicator between sexes.
<br />
<p>By extension, then, I conclude that if the mathematical concepts of &quot;order&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;size&quot; are not the basis of chemical isomers, then the mathematical 
<br />
concepts of &quot;order&quot; and &quot;size&quot; are not the basis of biological semiotics.
<br />
<p>If the the mathematical concepts of &quot;order&quot; and &quot;size&quot; fail to provide the 
<br />
critical concepts essential to biological and biomedical information, what 
<br />
is the alternative?
<br />
<p>A simple logical explication is available.
<br />
<p>This logical explication is the organization of  independent physical 
<br />
particles into dependent relationships by &quot;chemical bonds&quot;.
<br />
<p>Each chemical bond is an encoding of relationships between atoms as objects,
<br />
chemical objects with properties that include the abstract concept of 
<br />
number as well as physical properties.   (Again, a fancy way of expressing 
<br />
a simple idea that an atomic number is a number.)
<br />
<p>Thus, each molecule is an specific encoding of informational relations.
<br />
<p>The specific organization of a multiset of bonds among a multiset of atoms 
<br />
creates a specific code word, a code word that conveys information .
<br />
<p>Living systems have elaborated an extensive network of related code words 
<br />
that  specify relations among molecules.
<br />
<p>It goes without saying that the genetic matter, one of the sources of 
<br />
biological motion, is a critical set of code words that is an obvious 
<br />
source of specifying biochemical and biological relations.
<br />
<p>Some months ago, I posted a comment about the philosophical concept of 
<br />
organization, a mathematical sequence of composing relations (propositions, 
<br />
sorites)  leading to emergence.
<br />
<p>I would refer to this conceptualization as the organity of natural 
<br />
systems.   By extension, biosemiotics concerns itself with the organity of 
<br />
natural codes.
<br />
<p>A general conclusion is possible:
<br />
<p>Organic mathematics and mechanical mathematics both use symbols to 
<br />
communicate information.
<br />
<p>A communications systems grounded in either organic or mechanical 
<br />
mathematics uses specific encoding and decoding processes to transmit 
<br />
messages.   In mechanical mathematics, the encoding and decoding systems 
<br />
are abstract concepts based on concepts of order and size.  In organic 
<br />
mathematics, a natural encoding and decoding process provides the 
<br />
structural basis (molecular structures) which generate biosemiotics which 
<br />
in turn is the basis  for a wide range of phenomena.
<br />
<p>If anyone detects any tensions between the mathematics of the present 
<br />
comment and the earlier comment, I would be delighted to learn of potential 
<br />
flaws in either line of reasoning.
<br />
<p>In closing, I offer three comments to earlier posts.
<br />
<p>1. An alert reader will note the frequent usage of the term, &quot;concept&quot; in 
<br />
this comment.  As described in earlier writings, I use the term &quot;concept&quot; 
<br />
in the sense of &quot;to give birth to&quot;, separate and distinct from other terms.
<br />
<p>2. The question of evolution or emergence of living systems is not a 
<br />
question of selection, it is one of choice, choices of encodings that 
<br />
persist long after the putative &quot;selective conditions&quot; have vanished.
<br />
In living systems, the durable choices are encoded into the chemical memory 
<br />
of the genetic system.
<br />
<p>3. Rafael writes:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is well known that definitions are not true or false, but more 
<br />
or less fruitful. In a way, people are free to define terms as they like, 
<br />
but in reality their definitions may encounter problems. In children's 
<br />
play, a chair can be defined as a table and vice versa. This works as long 
<br />
as the children remember and obey their own decisions and do not apply 
<br />
their own conventions with outsiders. However, when somebody defines a term 
<br />
in such an idiosyncratic way, that definition will be neglected and will 
<br />
not contribute to understanding, communication, or the advance of practice.&quot;.
<br />
<p>Rafeal's paragraph is a perfectly reasonable working hypothesis for 
<br />
philosophy.  Within the communities of chemistry and mathematics,  a 
<br />
different, wholistic (not-relativistic) standard is held.
<br />
<p>We start with definitions and propositions.
<br />
<p>In order to develop a consistent set of propositions,
<br />
<p>we seek definitions for terms in propositions that fit into pairs of 
<br />
implications.
<br />
<p>We seek implicational pairs that generate syllogisms.
<br />
<p>We seek syllogisms that we can concatenate into sorites.
<br />
<p>In the chemical sciences, a further standard is essential to chemical 
<br />
communication and information.
<br />
Idealistically, we  seek propositions, implications, syllogisms, and 
<br />
sorites that are in harmony with the natural order and size of species 
<br />
existing in the material world.
