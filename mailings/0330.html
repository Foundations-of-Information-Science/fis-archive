Humankind is confronted today (September 2001) to very serious local,
<br />
regional and global problems generated by a post- and ultra-modern
<br />
colonialism (expansionism) managed by an intelligent decision making which
<br />
seems to be rather shortsighted, narrow minded and unable to recognize its
<br />
mistakes
<br />
<p>In May 1967 Bertalanffy wrote:
<br />
<p>&quot;...the ambivalence of science and technology has become apparent. The
<br />
menace of thermonuclear war, the population explosion, the social problems
<br />
in a cybernetic society are commonplace. The historian will note that
<br />
similar anxieties, though in a minor key, accompanied previous crises such
<br />
as the invention of airplanes and air raids, the birth pangs of
<br />
industrialization in the Victorian age, the introduction of firearms in the
<br />
late Middle Ages, and presumably the appearance of war chariots when
<br />
peoples from the Asiatic steppes overran the agricultural communities in
<br />
the Near East at the dawn of history. Doomsday has often been prophesied in
<br />
the course of history. What appears to be new, however, is that an old
<br />
intellectual attitude has broken down. Since Bacon of Verulam, the
<br />
perfectionist philosophers of the eighteenth century, and the belief in
<br />
progress of the nineteenth, advance of mankind by science and technology
<br />
was taken for granted. Even earlier, Plato believed that the human
<br />
predicament was amenable to solution if only philosophers became kings or
<br />
kings turned into philosophers. That Reason does not automatically lead to
<br />
a solution of the human problem and, by and large, has little influence in
<br />
the sanguinary course of human history, was the disappointing discovery of
<br />
our time.&quot; (In Preface of &quot;Robots. Men and Minds&quot;, 1967).
<br />
<p>His critical appreciations made him to believe that the need for a general
<br />
systems consciousness was a matter of life and death for the future
<br />
generations, but he &quot;was a true pioneer (and) he suffered a fate not
<br />
unusual for pioneers: the full recognition of the validity and significance
<br />
of his theories late in life or posthumously, and the subsequent
<br />
reemergence of his original notions in different fields and forms,
<br />
sometimes without reference to his earlier statements.&quot; International
<br />
Encyclopedy of the Social Sciences (Quoted by Davidson, Uncommon Sense,
<br />
1983)
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy died in 1972. Until today, most of his warnings have been
<br />
disregarded in general by the decision making that has prevailed since the
<br />
end of the 2nd World War and in particular by many systems researchers,
<br />
scholars and experts who tend to perform as accomplices of decision makers.
<br />
Humankind faces at present a very serious crisis generated by civilizing
<br />
(?) actions intelligently conceived and cleverly implemented in order to
<br />
maintain the trends of the prevalent civilization, despite the evidence of
<br />
its increasing inconsistency with its own societal engagement; in spite of
<br />
its growing incongruity with the planetary possibilities.
<br />
<p>&quot;Man makes himself&quot; (Gordon Childe). This assertion has been considered
<br />
indispensable for comprehending how our ancestors became human minded; it
<br />
seems to be dramatically valid  along the whole trajectory of civilization
<br />
for explaining the controversial history of every society constituted.
<br />
Consequently, nowadays it is not only impossible, but it would be tragic
<br />
and catastrophic to ignore how billions of humans have continued
<br />
'pedalling' in the sense allowed by civilizing trends while trying to
<br />
remain motivated, though fallaciously, by the main four events that
<br />
characterized the last 20th century :
<br />
<p>1. The First World War (1914 -1918) among European countries;
<br />
<p>2. The Second World War (1939 -1945) among European countries, Japan and USA;
<br />
<p>3. The actions conceived, organized and implemented during the postwar
<br />
period (starting around the 1950s) which allowed some winners and loosers
<br />
of the First and Second World War, being included several regimes
<br />
functioning in accordance with the modernized capitalist ideology and the
<br />
former U.S.S.R. presumably socialist, to become economically richer by
<br />
continuously taking advantage unilaterally of natural resources located
<br />
anywhere on the planet. Meanwhile the less developed countries became
<br />
systematically poorer and poorer. No doubt that some systems methodologies
<br />
have been also conceived and implemented for the benefit of the winners of
<br />
what might be considered de facto the Third World War - an economic one -
<br />
which was not even declared.
<br />
<p>4. The trends of the prevailing civilization, which have become during the
<br />
last decade seriously contradictory though they are announced everywhere,
<br />
through a powerful mass media, as the unique possibility of organizing
<br />
faster and faster everything related with the human way of life
<br />
(transportation, communications, data processing, internet since 1995,...).
<br />
These tendencies cannot be sustained anymore, neither according to
<br />
traditional procedures and even less humanely. These trends intend to be
<br />
altogether a drive toward a post- ultra modern perspective for the
<br />
evolvement of the human society, claiming that every modern human may and
<br />
must go - willingly or not - faster and faster everywhere , anywhere and
<br />
nowhere. They are basic factors of policies concerned with globalization of
<br />
business, finances and all kinds of economic transactions, which are
<br />
announced as if they were the panacea needed for pushing ahead the
<br />
evolvement of the 'civilized way of life'. However it is a controversial
<br />
globalization that has caused the emergence of many dissidents who  argue
<br />
that it has started the Fourth World War - an economic and political one -
<br />
which aims, supported ideologically by an inhuman neoliberalism, at
<br />
destroying borders, governments and nationalisms because they are not
<br />
longer necessary. This event has become already the source of a generalized
<br />
globalization of unemployment, criminality, misery, corruption,... and also
<br />
frivolity, hypocrisy,...
<br />
<p>Some months ago started conventionally the 3rd millennium, without being
<br />
altered the conditions that pretend to maintain the trends of the
<br />
prevailing civilization. However, some powerful decision makers, while
<br />
inevitably realizing their growing inconsistency, have considered
<br />
absolutely necessary to advance from the credence in the unipolar world or
<br />
&quot;the end of history&quot; towards a new  (?) perspective conceived cleverly
<br />
inside powerful corporations. Intelligent minds have started to &quot;examine
<br />
the spread of 'grey' areas. This grey reflects the uncertainty about
<br />
changes that still defy analysis: crises with no political or military
<br />
outcome that persist while the international community looks on, powerless
<br />
and unconcerned&quot;  The immediate perspective looks as if it were a very new
<br />
kind of fight against humankind, it could become the Fifth World War (the
<br />
first one of the 21st century) - an economic, political and pseudo cultural
<br />
one - that apparently aims at making possible the emergence of a new
<br />
international division &quot;between a 'useful' world, on which the powerful
<br />
focus, and a 'useless' one whose stability does not justify the loss of a
<br />
single western soldier&quot; (Pierre CONESA,: Places of no importance, section
<br />
&quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; published by the Guardian Weekly, March 2001).
<br />
<p>But few hours ago a suicidal terrorism that was not expected has caused the
<br />
suffering of many people who were not responsible of the serious
<br />
inconsistency that  has been accelerating the degradation of the whole
<br />
civilizing adventure.
<br />
<p>Could humans, identify a possible WAY?
<br />
<p>It could be the R'ta (Vedic principle) that Edward Goldsmith learnt from
<br />
Krishna Chaitanya as being &quot;the behaviour pattern adhered to by early
<br />
Indian society to maintain the critical order of the cosmos&quot;
<br />
<p>It could be the &quot;steady state&quot; or &quot;flow equilibrium&quot; that need humankind as
<br />
an open system requiring urgently to function peacefully.
