                    Dear Friends,

                    Maryland USA
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ulan&#64;cbl.umces.edu&gt;
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that economies have two basic
                    dimensions of
                    <br />
                    internal order: one is organic and relates to functional and structural
                    <br />
                    properties, which have their analogue in other living systems like
                    <br />
                    ecosystems; and the other is cognitive, meaning that a broad
                    <br />
                    perspective of the world that human agents hold streamlines collective
                    <br />
                    behavior and economic activities. Both dimensions of order are
                    <br />
                    maintained by dissipating the fabric of the natural environment. These
                    <br />
                    dimensions are dynamic and the change in their internal parameters
                    <br />
                    reflects on the scale and intensity of the interference with natural
                    <br />
                    structures and processes.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the organic side we propose that dynamics in
                    industrial
                    <br />
                    market economies are essentially autocatalytic (Matutinovic, 2005).
                    <br />
                    Autocatalysis refers to &quot;any cyclical concatenation of processes
                    <br />
                    wherein each member has the propensity to accelerate the activity of
                    <br />
                    the succeeding link&quot; (Ulanowicz 1999, pp.41-55). Through competition
                    <br />
                    and selection autocatalysis imparts organization to a system, which can
                    <br />
                    be recognized, among other things, in the asymmetric distribution of
                    <br />
                    flows among its members. It appears that industrialized economies have
                    <br />
                    reached a high level of internal organization (ascendency),
                    <br />
                    characterized by (truncated) power-law distributions across different
                    <br />
                    structural and dynamical variables (size of firms, size of cities,
                    <br />
                    degree distribution of business links, business cycle fluctuations
                    <br />
                    etc.). (Matutinovic, 2002; 2005)
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their inner dynamics and openness to the
                    wider
                    <br />
                    system, economic autocatalytic assemblages, like their counterparts
                    <br />
                    elsewhere in the living realm, exhibit growth and centripetality in
                    <br />
                    that they amass material and energy from their environment.
                    <br />
                    Additionally, as a consequence of competition and selection,
                    <br />
                    autocatalysis tends to ratchet all participants towards higher levels
                    <br />
                    of performance (Ulanowicz 1997, p.46). This process is not confined to
                    <br />
                    a single loop but transfers its influence to the wider systemic
                    <br />
                    environment via connections that exist among assemblages of different
                    <br />
                    autocatalytic loops. One example of autocatalytic process in economy,
                    <br />
                    which comprises all of the above mentioned properties, is the formation
                    <br />
                    of industrial clusters. Centripetal process of amassing material and
                    <br />
                    energy can also be seen on the global scale, where the G7 (economic
                    <br />
                    system level) and multinational companies (agent level) appropriate
                    <br />
                    disproportionate chunks of natural sources and sinks. Modern market
                    <br />
                    economies are probably much more efficient in their resource
                    <br />
                    consumption than the early industrial or pre industrial societies. The
                    <br />
                    problem is, clearly, that the scale of their dissipative processes has
                    <br />
                    increased markedly with respect to those of natural sources and sinks,
                    <br />
                    a situation that is generally regarded as unsustainable.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of &quot;organic&quot; in socioeconomic
                    systems is related
                    <br />
                    to diversity. Ecological economists generally agree that functional and
                    <br />
                    structural aspects of biodiversity have their analogue in socioeconomic
                    <br />
                    systems, especially when we regard the global economy and the
                    <br />
                    biosphere. Socioeconomic diversity is functionally related to
                    <br />
                    thermodynamic efficiency in energy/resources exploitation, adaptation
                    <br />
                    to local environments, avoiding of head to head competition over
                    <br />
                    resources and preserving resilience to yet unknown shocks and boundary
                    <br />
                    conditions (Matutinovic, 2001). The issue of loss of socioeconomic
                    <br />
                    diversity is closely related to that of scale of dissipative processes:
                    <br />
                    as the number of industrialized economies increases (maximum power
                    <br />
                    efficiency increases) the cumulative burden on environment becomes
                    <br />
                    unbearable, and the thermodynamic efficiency of the system goes down
                    <br />
                    (as societies &quot;modernize&quot; according to the Western model they become
                    <br />
                    increasingly unable to stay with their particular local climatic and
                    <br />
                    other natural endowments).
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cognitive side we can make distinction between
                    <br />
                    worldviews, institutions and mental models. One can define worldview as
                    <br />
                    a set of beliefs, symbols, values and segments of objective knowledge
                    <br />
                    that is widely shared by a society over a considerable period of time
                    <br />
                    (for at least one generation). It provides a socially-shared cognitive
                    <br />
                    framework that relates an individual to her or his natural and social
                    <br />
                    environment. Institutions generally define behavioral framework in a
                    <br />
                    given society. They streamline most of the societal and economic
                    <br />
                    activities, and provide a degree of behavioral stability and
                    <br />
                    predictability over longer periods of time. Institutions may be defined
                    <br />
                    as &quot;a regularity of behavior or a rule that is generally accepted by
                    <br />
                    members of a social group, that specifies behavior in specific
                    <br />
                    situations, and that is either self-policed or policed by external
                    <br />
                    authority&quot;. Mental models are cognitive devices employed at the level
                    <br />
                    of the individual agent, and are composed of values, beliefs, rules,
                    <br />
                    and habits that relate an agent to everyday life situations. The
                    <br />
                    process of interaction between mental models at the individual level
                    <br />
                    and worldviews and institutions at the level of society is complex and
                    <br />
                    multi-directional, to the extent that it is impossible to construct
                    <br />
                    clear-cut boundaries of mutual influence or unique causal loops. We can
                    <br />
                    focus, however, on influences that work down the heirarchy: from the
                    <br />
                    worldview, to institutions, and finally to the behavior of the
                    <br />
                    individual. Since a dominant worldview and its institutional framework
                    <br />
                    are shared by a society, they define its prevailing and characteristic
                    <br />
                    behavioral patterns. There is a feedback from behavior to the worldview
                    <br />
                    which symbolizes that individual or group actions may affect the
                    <br />
                    prevailing paradigm either gradually (cultural evolution) or abruptly
                    <br />
                    (social revolution). Technological advance and change, which result
                    <br />
                    from individual and collective actions, feeds eventually back to
                    <br />
                    behavior by affecting directly life styles, and indirectly by
                    <br />
                    influencing the dominant worldview. An example of the first is the
                    <br />
                    impact of mass production of automobiles on individual transport
                    <br />
                    habits, and an instance of the second is the reinforcement of those
                    <br />
                    values that are related to individualism, freedom of movement, and
                    <br />
                    material possessions as status symbols. Collective behavior and
                    <br />
                    available technology define the overall impact that socioeconomic
                    <br />
                    system exerts on environment.

                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dynamical model of institutional change under feedback
                    would
                    <br />
                    depict such change as involving two major elements: the natural
                    <br />
                    environment, and the cognitive constraints embodied in the prevailing
                    <br />
                    worldview (Figure 1). The institutional framework defines the
                    <br />
                    collective behavior of a society with respect to the natural
                    <br />
                    environment - basically the patterns of exploitation of its sources and
                    <br />
                    sinks through the activities of production and consumption. These
                    <br />
                    activities produce a reaction from environment which feeds back to the
                    <br />
                    world view in the form of information. Proper interpretation of
                    <br />
                    feedback information is disturbed, however, by fundamental and
                    <br />
                    procedural uncertainty, since scientific models and theories cannot
                    <br />
                    fully encompass the complex dynamics of ecosystems or the biosphere. An
                    <br />
                    ambiguous or partial interpretation of feedback information will impact
                    <br />
                    negatively on its ability to update the dominant worldview. For
                    <br />
                    example, uncertainty in the interpretation of data related to global
                    <br />
                    warming weakens any update of the current materialistic, growth
                    <br />
                    oriented worldview and, consequently, results in only palliative
                    <br />
                    institutional changes (a slow and uncertain adoption of Kyoto Protocol;
                    <br />
                    the introduction of trading in pollution permits instead of imposing
                    <br />
                    more stringent rules on industry and consumer behavior, etc.)
                    <br />
                    Similarly, early misinterpretation of low ozone levels in Antarctic as
                    <br />
                    &quot;data noise&quot; most probably retarded global institutional action (the
                    <br />
                    Montreal Protocol) against the application of CFCs in manufacturing and
                    <br />
                    consumer products. Institutions are subject to a selection process
                    <br />
                    that may be cultural (social and economic) or environmental.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A negative environmental feedback, however, does not act on
                    an
                    <br />
                    institutional framework directly - a dominant worldview acts as a
                    <br />
                    &quot;censoring body&quot; that filters alternative courses in institutional
                    <br />
                    change regardless of their objective value or urgency. This process of
                    <br />
                    biased and constrained institutional selection retards societal
                    <br />
                    learning and adaptive change in collective behavior. The model implies
                    <br />
                    the likelihood of a worldview replacement after a single, strong update
                    <br />
                    event (e.g. environmental collapse) or when the cumulative effect of
                    <br />
                    the updating process had surpassed a threshold, beyond which a dominant
                    <br />
                    worldview becomes untenable. However, when this final change might
                    <br />
                    happen remains intrinsically unknowable. It remains a fundamental
                    <br />
                    uncertainty as to whether the dominant worldview in the North will be
                    <br />
                    changed in time to avoid major ecological/socioeconomic crisis.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important also to note that the welfare liberalism of
                    the
                    <br />
                    North and the drive towards economic globalization are both strongly
                    <br />
                    tied to the notion of efficiency. Time and again, socio-economic
                    <br />
                    changes are justified on the basis of their contributions to overall
                    <br />
                    efficiency. While it is true that autocatalysis promotes efficiency,
                    <br />
                    without which an economic community is liable to being displaced, the
                    <br />
                    lesson from the biological realm is that efficiency is not what
                    <br />
                    sustains communities in the long run. Diversity of processes and
                    <br />
                    sectors implies the co-existence of various degrees of efficiency. The
                    <br />
                    cost of retaining structures and processes of less than optimal
                    <br />
                    efficiency (referred to as &quot;overhead&quot; in network analysis) can be more
                    <br />
                    than recouped when the system is impacted by a novel disturbance. At
                    <br />
                    such time of stress, it is usually from the suboptimal system elements
                    <br />
                    that a response arises that allows the system to persist. As an extreme
                    <br />
                    example, a community that outsources most of its manufacturing
                    <br />
                    capability in the name of the efficiency of low-cost labor elsewhere,
                    <br />
                    obviously becomes highly vulnerable to any multitude of perturbations
                    <br />
                    that might disrupt global trade. The integrity of ecosystems is said to
                    <br />
                    reside in a tension between the (opposing) trends towards efficiency
                    <br />
                    and diversity. To extirpate either would render the system
                    <br />
                    unsustainable (Ulanowicz 1995.) The same likely could be said of social
                    <br />
                    and economic systems.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of sustainability may be, therefore, related
                    <br />
                    primarily to the possibility of change of the prevailing (Western)
                    <br />
                    worldview based on materialistic values and an unjustified,
                    <br />
                    disproportionate belief in the ability of market efficiency alone to
                    <br />
                    mediate most of the social, economic and environmental relations. The
                    <br />
                    positive change of dominant worldview should subsequently reduce the
                    <br />
                    intensity of autocatalytic processes in the world economy, and release
                    <br />
                    the current pressure to diminish cultural diversity. It will,
                    <br />
                    therefore, reflect on the &quot;organic&quot; dimension. Without such systemic
                    <br />
                    changes we can hardly hope that any further improvements in
                    <br />
                    organization of material/energy flows (industrial ecology, cleaner
                    <br />
                    production and similar concepts) will help solve the problem of our
                    <br />
                    impact on Nature. The &quot;window of vitality&quot; must be related in
                    <br />
                    socioeconomic systems to both cognitive and organic dimensions.
