Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This response addresses several issues related to information and meaning.
<br />
In particular, I respond to Chistophe's and Rafael's posts.
<br />
<p>I proposed on September 28, in an extension of John Holgate post of Sept 20.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As John notes, the separation of meaning is not restricted to grammar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and Shannon information theory. Most philosophers of mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;claim that no meaning is attached to mathematical rules or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;structures. By way of contrast, the language of chemistry and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;chemical grammars are meaningful - a matter of common experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If one assumes that formally, &quot;information&quot; has no meaning, then one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;must turn elsewhere to identify the source of meaning and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As a logical parallel, I would point out that the nature of entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(as a physical phenomenon) depends of the co-existence of temperature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In bare bone terms:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you get nothing from nothing;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you get something from something.
</em><br />
<p><p>Chistrophe Menart writes on Sept. 29, 2002:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The two points brought up by John and Jerry underline aspects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our discussion that could deserve further developments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Separation of meaning from information:
</em><br />
<p>I strongly concur that these topics need further development.  At 
<br />
issue is the nature of relation between the terms &quot;communication&quot; as 
<br />
a community based activity and information as a reductionistic 
<br />
concept of isolationism.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As already written in a previous post, I feel that a meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cannot exist without an information carrying it.
</em><br />
<p>Your feelings are important.  But how do you relate these feeling to 
<br />
meaningful communication with colleagues?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, a meaning is an information, a meaningful information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Information being the component of a signal, a variation of energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ex: sound, light, chemical element, protein,...).
</em><br />
<p>But, what are the other components of a signal if other than 
<br />
information?  What else exists that is placed with information to 
<br />
give the fullness to meaningful?  In particular, can you spatially 
<br />
separate the transport of information from the generating functions 
<br />
creating meaning?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In our brains, mental states are related to variation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurotransmitter patterns. The meanings in our brains are based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information status in neurons (understanding that a lot is to be done in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this field, specially regarding the nature of consciousness).
</em><br />
<p>I find this paragraph blurs together several distinctions.  Brains 
<br />
are anatomical components of our bodies, brains have biochemical 
<br />
components and an underlying genetic basis for the generating 
<br />
functions.
<br />
I do not understand how the concept of a &quot;mental state&quot; relates to these facts.
<br />
The postulate that &quot;information status in neurons&quot; exists is equally 
<br />
unclear to me.  Perhaps you could relate these terms to principles of 
<br />
communication?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But this does not mean that all information is meaningful. Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information are meaningless, but most information can participate to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creation of meaningful information Ex: Noise from thunderstorm is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a meaningful information per se. But this noise in going to participate to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the creation of a meaning in our brain. For instance, the created meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be &quot;rain is comming&quot;. And this meaning will generate an action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;look for shelter&quot;.
</em><br />
<p>This example hardly supports your thesis unless one assumes that 
<br />
&quot;information&quot; is tightly coupled to human values and utilitarian 
<br />
patterns of belief.  &quot;Thunder&quot; has quantitative physical qualities 
<br />
(intensity as a function of duration and frequency) that communicate 
<br />
a great deal of information.  As Wordsworth said, the ear can not but 
<br />
to hear, the eye can not but to see.  We are coupled to nature 
<br />
*NATURE!* in an intimate and detailed manner that is rooted in human 
<br />
history, not just conceptual abstractions.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) Origin of meaning:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we agree that a meaning is a meaningful information, we have to look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the generation of this information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As some already know, I feel there is a way to modelize a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Meaning Generator System&quot; (MGS) as being a system submitted to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraint that has to be satisfied.
</em><br />
<p>I strongly concur that we must examine the origin of meanings.
<br />
<p>The concept of a &quot;Meaning Generator System&quot; (MGS)&quot; could perhaps be useful.
<br />
Why introduce the notion of restrictions on freedoms in order to 
<br />
generate meaning.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature is.  Why should nature be denied freedom in the process of 
<br />
communication?
<br />
<p>Are these constraints intended to give a physical gloss to the concept of MGS?
<br />
<p>In the notion of &quot;organic communication&quot; I presuppose that intrinsic 
<br />
to a living system is a chemical dynamic that generates change, that 
<br />
such change is intrinsic to the life cycle of the organism. 
<br />
Information entering the system changes the intrinsic dynamic in a 
<br />
specific manner.
<br />
<p>Is this view close or distant from your view of MGS?
<br />
<p>Rafeal writes:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I mean,
<br />
if I am thirsty it is because my body is
<br />
of this kind that it needs water.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC responds:
<br />
This appears to capture at least one aspect of the concept 
<br />
distinction between Shannon information as a isolationistic statement 
<br />
of great value to mathematics and engineering and the core values of 
<br />
biological communication in an organic world.
<br />
<p><p>Christophe responds:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel we can say that it is more
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a question about a difference of complexity than about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference of nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you agree ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
And Rafael responds:
<br />
yes, but the difference does not just come from the
<br />
progammer, it comes basically from the kind of being
<br />
a robot is (in case it is not a *flesh* one... at least...
<br />
<p>JLRC responds:
<br />
<p>Christophe chooses to introduce the ill-defined notion of complexity 
<br />
as a means to bridge the distinction between mechanical communication 
<br />
and organic communication.  It is not clear to me why this term 
<br />
(complexity) resolves anything.  Communication has the potential to 
<br />
relate various ideas and concepts about information and meaning.  I 
<br />
am skeptical that the term &quot;complexity&quot; has an analogous potential 
<br />
resolving power.
<br />
<p>On a practical level, one distinction between robotics and living 
<br />
organisms is the capability of living organisms to sustain an 
<br />
dynamic by purposeful acquisitions from the external world.  This is 
<br />
coupled with an evolutionary potential for organic change.  The 
<br />
abstract Platonic world of mathematics generates many images of the 
<br />
type proposed by Christophe.  How are such images validated?  or 
<br />
reified?
<br />
<p>The data collected by the robot can not be placed in correspondence 
<br />
with the meaning acquired by a living organism, can it?  Without 
<br />
success, I have sought such a quantitative translation for more than 
<br />
two decades.   Christophe, if you feel that you can construct such a 
<br />
correspondence relation, I would delighted if you would help me learn 
<br />
your method of construction.
<br />
<p><p>Cheers
<br />
