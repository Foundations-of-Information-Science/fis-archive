<br />
<p>A message of (hopefully) general interest to the participants of the FIS
<br />
virtual conference:
<br />
<p>I believe that this event, the coming into existence of the FIS virtual
<br />
discourse, is very important, 
<br />
and I want to contribute a few thoughts. 
<br />
<p>First: social bodies, capacity of natural languages (Koichiro Matsuno)
<br />
This is quite a select(ed) group of people, who are among the most
<br />
knowledgeable on this planet 
<br />
about the matter of information (excuse the pun, Norbert Wiener). If I
<br />
am not mistaken, this 
<br />
group is also able to exert quite a measure of influence on the future
<br />
development that the subject 
<br />
is going to take. I find it very important that this group is (or has
<br />
the capability of) forming into a 
<br />
societal entity by opening up this discourse. Koichiro Matsuno touched
<br />
on an important point 
<br />
with his question about the capacity of natural languages. I would want
<br />
to enlarge on this in a 
<br />
separate discussion, and what I mean by &quot;social entity&quot;, and this would
<br />
cover some material that I 
<br />
would like to bring in on the fascinating subject of societal
<br />
information. (I have made a starter 
<br />
with my contribution to the FIS 96 special issue of BioSystems.) But I
<br />
must be careful not to try 
<br />
to cover too many points here.
<br />
<p>Second: problems for net discourses
<br />
I have watched a good many interesting net discourses becoming frayed in
<br />
trivialities and go 
<br />
completely paralyzed. Or I myself felt paralyzed trying to follow them.
<br />
I remember one virtual 
<br />
conference, which I thought was very interesting with respect to the
<br />
subject, of which I had to 
<br />
shut myself off, because I couldn't keep the threads together. It just
<br />
consumed too much of my 
<br />
time and energy. If anyone is interested, this is their URL.

<br />
<p>Third: necessity for technical information infrastructures
<br />
Keeping up, monitoring, and contributing to, inter-netted discourses is
<br />
largely a matter of 
<br />
technical information infrastructures, and I believe, that we are not
<br />
quite there yet, what concerns 
<br />
the right infrastructure tools. Unfortunately neither the email programs
<br />
nor the news facilities are 
<br />
quite up to the task. Sending assorted mails and appending the issues
<br />
and former contributions to 
<br />
which one refers, within the email body as comment, is quite hopeless.
<br />
One loses the overview, 
<br />
and someone entering late, has practically no chance of catching up.
<br />
<p>Fourth: some suggestions for technical information infrastructures
<br />
Wanting to keep matters short, I want to suggest a few things: The
<br />
organizer / moderator of the 
<br />
virtual discourse will have a very hard time keeping things in shape,
<br />
unless assisted by the right 
<br />
tools (and possibly some volunteers). I am presently building up a WWW
<br />
discourse myself, and 
<br />
see myself in the same problem case. And I am also looking out for the
<br />
right tools. This depends 
<br />
also &quot;on a little help from a few friends&quot;, because no-one can keep the
<br />
rapidly moving SW 
<br />
industry in surveillance. I believe there has to be an &quot;information
<br />
infrastructure&quot; group that can 
<br />
address these issues, and I am willing to contribute a share. Formerly I
<br />
worked as a software 
<br />
engineer, doing MM / HM development, and I have made some outlines for
<br />
DP (data processing) 
<br />
infrastructures for supporting netted discourses. I am appending a text
<br />
in which I describe some 
<br />
points that I think are essential.
<br />
One of the main infrastructure tools needed is for quickly and
<br />
automatically converting email 
<br />
messages into browsable WWW html text, since this is the only way to
<br />
keep discussion threads 
<br />
together which are simply impossible to follow with current email tools
<br />
(I am using the Netscape 
<br />
email, which I think is more than crummy). Then, this necessitates a key
<br />
coding scheme for 
<br />
emails, because if there is an automatic filter, it must have a unique
<br />
keying scheme, etc. etc. 
<br />
Some email programs (not Netscape) allow to automatically pre-sort
<br />
incoming messages by 
<br />
sender into bins. That also helps keeping track (a little). If this
<br />
facility is to be used, all emails 
<br />
must come from ONE SENDER ONLY. 
<br />
I suggest that we also find a way for distributing the papers of the
<br />
last FIS so that we don't need 
<br />
to wait until next year or longer when they are finally in print. Since
<br />
these publications are also 
<br />
usually not available in the local library, this is of no great help
<br />
anyhow.
<br />
<p>I will keep it short, since I found it is a pain for me to read long
<br />
emails, and I don't want to 
<br />
impose that on anyone else either. For more food for thought, see the
<br />
enclosed WinWord2 files.
