Dear Pedro and All:
<br />
<p>Thank you for the questions with regard the biochemical perspectives. 
<br />
As you are aware, biochemistry has one foot in chemistry (particiularly
<br />
analytical methods) and one foot in biology (particularly efforts to
<br />
itentify chemical components of living systems and the rates of
<br />
biological processes).  It is closely linked to both physiology and
<br />
genetics, as you well know.  
<br />
<p>One sharp distinction between biochemistry and biology is the analytical
<br />
methodology of biochemistry seeks to sustain the chemical principles of
<br />
conservation of mass and energy as well as the one-to-one correspondence
<br />
principle in causality relationships.
<br />
(It must be clearly stated that the one-to-one correspondence relations
<br />
are not widely used in biology or medicine - the notable exception being
<br />
in genetics via Mendel's Rules.  see further explaination below.)
<br />
<p>Thus, the taxonomy of biochemicals is the same as the taxonomy of
<br />
chemistry.  We count up the atoms and the bonds and form a mathematical
<br />
graph which connects all the atoms and bonds in a systematic manner. 
<br />
This &quot;graph&quot; conserves the one-to-one correspondence as a truth function
<br />
over the material  content and is the primary linkage to all
<br />
thermodynamics  functions, including the (much maligned) entropy
<br />
function.
<br />
<p>With this as background, I turn to your questions with regard to
<br />
taxonomy, closure and function of biochemical constitutents of a living
<br />
organism.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the entropy content of good-sized molecules...
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking at the first paragraph, perhaps it looks rather close to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grandiose reductionist claims about biology... 
</em><br />
<p>I did not explain myself well:
<br />
The notion of 'degrees of organization' is a constructive notion and
<br />
does not have any simple relationship to reductionism.  The example
<br />
means to show that:
<br />
<p>1. particles can be composed into atoms and that
<br />
2. atoms can be composed into molecules.
<br />
<p>I add to this list two further compositions:
<br />
<p>3. Molecules can be composed into biopolymers (proteins, nucleic acids,
<br />
lipids, polysaccarides, and combinations of these.)
<br />
4. A cell is composed from particles, atoms, molecules, and biopolymers.
<br />
<p>The operations connecting these compositions are ADDITIVE operations
<br />
which construct degrees of organization 1,2,3,4 and 5. 
<br />
No DIVISIONAL operations are used in these compositions!  (No
<br />
&quot;reductionism&quot;)  
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this regard I would like to hear your biochemical responses to these three
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions which could be related to your tenets:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1- what are the fundamental molecular players of life?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
The fundamental players are the set of molecules necessary and
<br />
sufficient for life.
<br />
For a pre-existing organism, these are the essential nutrients which
<br />
sustain life itself.
<br />
<p>For physiological or functional purposes, a large set of molecules are
<br />
essential for normal function.  In effect, it is the set of molecules
<br />
which the organism makes from the essential nutrients.  
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a logical perspective, the sufficiency for life does not come from
</em><br />
any one molecule.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a biochemical perspective, life is a cooperative, collaborative
</em><br />
effort, distributed over a large set of molecules.  (Of course, DNA is
<br />
important - but DNA as a molecule is relatively inert and serves to
<br />
complement other molecular structures rather than generate new molecular
<br />
structures.  The &quot;power&quot; of DNA comes from its influence on other
<br />
molecules as a source of potential, not its generative capacities per
<br />
se.)
<br />
<p>I conjecture that biochemical functioning is a metaphor for social
<br />
system functioning.  At it's essence, it is cooperative, collaborative
<br />
effort distributed over a large set of contributors.  Sequences of
<br />
internal and external exchanges sustain the dynamics of the system as a
<br />
whole.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2- are their corresponding functions &quot;picturable&quot; from a quantum point of view?
</em><br />
<p>Quantum rules relate to electrical charges of subatomic particles. 
<br />
Since the compositional taxonomy starts with the three particles
<br />
(electrons, protons and neutrons), all further compositions of molecules
<br />
(including biopolymers) are based on quantum rules.
<br />
The literature contains 'pictures' of biomolecular structures as a
<br />
function of 'quantum rules'.  Often, related pictures from 'molecular
<br />
mechanics' are given because the mathematics is more tractable.  
<br />
<p>More specifically, any structural change of molecules (such as burning
<br />
sugars for energy)
<br />
require changes in the chemical graphs and the one-to-one
<br />
correspondences.  These chemical graph changes must be accounted for in
<br />
a precise one-to-one correspondence in the quantum calculations.
<br />
<p>Note that you question and my answer span all five degrees of
<br />
organization!!
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3- is life strictly related to such molecules--and only to them? 
</em><br />
<p>Yes and No - if you wish an answer based on experimental evidence.
<br />
All living systems depend on essential nutrients from the surrounding
<br />
&quot;ecoment&quot; to support themselves.  
<br />
In sharp contrast to quantum systems, for which the equations are set-up
<br />
to identify a minimal energies to satisfy the objectives of the physical
<br />
and chemical observations, I am not aware of any assertions that living
<br />
systems seek minimal energy levels.  A contrary rule exists - organisms
<br />
grow exponentially.  
<br />
<p>To cite Bergson:  A living system climbs hills, inert matter does not.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense the claim that we may have &quot;Artificial Life&quot; built upon other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (eg, silicon) molecular supports? 
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;I defer to others on this question.
<br />
<p>(or instead of AL, put &quot;artificial
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence&quot; or &quot;Infophlogiston&quot; for that matter). In another way, in what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degree do you assume the bio-separability between &quot;matterial support&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;logical form&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
The experiemntal evidence does not suggest a strict one-to-one
<br />
correspondence between materiality and a cell.  Rather a cell (as as
<br />
well as mammals) have a wide range of adaptibility from this
<br />
perspective.  Many genes may be deleted and the organism may still
<br />
function.  This must be placed in contrast with Shannon information,
<br />
where a critical assumption is the stationarity of the statistical
<br />
distribution.  Living organism are neither at equilibrium nor are they
<br />
stationary.  Therefore, one can not assign truth functions on the basis
<br />
of one-to-one correspondences that are routinuely used in physics and
<br />
chemistry.
<br />
(As noted above, certain genetic functions can be treated as
<br />
one-to-one.)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you wish, an extra question further ascending in the bio realm could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the biochemical cellular tools which support the emergence of multicell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisms...
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a philosophical prerspective, this question can be viewed as an
</em><br />
extension of cooperation and collaboration to a higher degree of
<br />
organization.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>In your second message of March 12, you ask:  
<br />
---snip---
<br />
May I come back to my awkward question a few days ago on the fundamental
<br />
molecular players of life? Perhaps you would agree with this
<br />
classification
<br />
of sorts:
<br />
<p>1) WATER, 2) PROTEINACEOUS STUFF, 3) NUCLEIC ACID STUFF, 4)
<br />
PHOSPHOLIPIDS
<br />
and others.
<br />
---snip--
<br />
The introduction to this message addresses specifically why I would not
<br />
accept these terms as a suitable taxonomy.  
<br />
<p>--another snip--
<br />
After Szent Gyvrgyi so wonderful comments in the 604s and 704s, it seems
<br />
that no one talks any more about the properties and roles (including
<br />
info
<br />
ones) of water. But in biology, water would be like a parallel of the
<br />
VACUUM and its generative properties in quantum physics... of course,
<br />
including the possibility of playing compositional games-languages of
<br />
cells
<br />
within that (solvent) milieu.
<br />
<p>are these views palatable to you?
<br />
<p>-----snip--
<br />
This metaphor misses the taxonomical role of water in the chemistry of
<br />
life.  Water furnishes a proton for many, many, many reactions in the
<br />
cell.  It has a specific geometric structure.  It is an active
<br />
participant in virtually all living processes but is not generative in
<br />
the sense that amino acids, carbohydrates, etc are generative of
<br />
biopolymers.  
<br />
<p>I hope the responses to your questions is not too technical for this
<br />
group.   If anyone needs a translation to more general language, I will
<br />
be happy to attempt to clarify the meanings.   I presume many will
<br />
disagree with some of the philosophies expressed.  Your responses would
<br />
be of considerable interest to me...  The challenge is to integrate many
<br />
views into a coherent whole.  
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
Jerry
