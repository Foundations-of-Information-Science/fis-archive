                <p>I am pretty sure that a mathematical theory of meaning is not a
                    <br />
                    possibility, for much the same reason as a purely mathematical theory of
                    <br />
                    induction is not possible. There are mathematical constraints on a
                    <br />
                    satisfactory theory of meaning (it must fit model theory, for example,
                    <br />
                    and not contradict the lambda calculus), and the formal aspects must be
                    <br />
                    able to be embodied in a suitable metaphysics, but as soon as you get to
                    <br />
                    this point you have left mathematics. Barwise and Perry's situational
                    <br />
                    semantics offers and embodiable mathematics, but violates a context free
                    <br />
                    version model theory. Talmont-Kaminski and myself suggest a modification
                    <br />
                    of the Barwise-Perry approach inspired by Peirce that allows a Montague
                    <br />
                    style semantics and pragmatics to be recovered, but that is only after
                    <br />
                    we determine meaning by non formal techniques. The problems and the
                    <br />
                    solution are outlined in our &quot;Pragmatist Pragmatics&quot; due out later this
                    <br />
                    year in Philosophica. There is a draft version at
                    <br />
                    <a
                        href="../../www.ukzn.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/pragmatist%20pragmatics.pdf">http://www.ukzn.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/pragmatist%20pragmatics.pdf</a>
                    <br />
                <p>Incidentally, since it is arguable that there is no mathematical theory
                    <br />
                    that captures exactly the concept of number, the above should not be
                    <br />
                    surprising. Barwise was motivated by this problem, but we feel he and
                    <br />
                    Perry thew more out than they needed to. My supervisor, Bill Demopoulos,
                    <br />
                    wrote a paper, The Philosophical Basis of Our Knowledge of Number,
                    <br />
                    No&amp;ucirc;s &gt; Vol. 32, No. 4 (Dec., 1998), pp. 481-503, in which he
                    <br />
                    argues that formal methods can give us a set of entities suitable for
                    <br />
                    number theory (part of pure mathematics) but cannot give us a set of
                    <br />
                    entities corresponding to our everyday use of number. The main problem
                    <br />
                    to overcome has been long known as the Julius Caesar problem, since
                    <br />
                    Fregean formalism, as Frege knew, cannot rule out Julius Caesar being a
                    <br />
                    number. Demopoulos'solution is the same one I would advocate. In any
                    <br />
                    case, since a purely mathematical theory of number is impossible, it
                    <br />
                    follows directly that a purely mathematical theory of meaning is
                    <br />
                    impossible. I noted this in my PhD thesis (which, not surprisingly,
                    <br />
                    Demopoulos supervised), and used the result to argue that Kuhnian
                    <br />
                    incommensurability cannot be resolved by purely formal approaches (it is
                    <br />
                    not a purely formal problem). Incommensurability, in fact, is a direct
                    <br />
                    result of making two assumptions 1) that any difference in meaning must
                    <br />
                    make a difference to possible experience (Peirce's Pragmatic Maxim) and
                    <br />
                    2) the weakest verificationism. The latter, verificationism, is a direct
                    <br />
                    consequence of thinking that a mathematical theory of meaning can
                    <br />
                    exhaust meaning. If one holds both 1 and 2, then incommensurability is
                    <br />
                    inevitable, and there will be an appearance that truth is constructed.
                    <br />
                    However, I would say that that appearance is an illusion of accepting 2.
                    <br />
                    It is quite easy to assume 2 without knowing it, but the typical
                    <br />
                    strategy that presupposes some version of 2 is to identify truth and/or
                    <br />
                    meaning with something else that is not truth and/or meaning, but
                    <br />
                    something more tractable.
                    <br />
                <p>Loet may not have meant that a mathematical theory of meaning would tell
                    <br />
                    us what meaning is, since he may think that it has other aspects as well
                    <br />
                    that are not mathematical (as I would say mathematical physics does). If
                    <br />
                    so, I submit that all the mathematics we need for a theory of meaning
                    <br />
                    are already available to us. But the hard work is only begun.
