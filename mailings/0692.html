<p>
Folks,
<br />
<p>We are now going to take an official break until Monday, September 2. 
<br />
Advice will follow then about the next set of papers and moderators.
<br />
<p>I want to thank everyone for making my job as moderator so easy.
<br />
<p>I will just review the recent exchanges, without going into detail.
<br />
<p>First, I asked some questions that were designed to get at whether or not a 
<br />
purely computational model is sufficient for information science. I take it 
<br />
that the overall response was &quot;no&quot;, though this should not preclude 
<br />
rigorous formalization in some weaker sense than Turing effectiveness. 
<br />
Since the information processing model is restricted to the same set of 
<br />
cases as Turing effectiveness, I think it is fair to say that information 
<br />
theory is not to founded on an information processing model alone. Taking 
<br />
this step has costs and benefits. The main cost is that information theory 
<br />
may be undecidable, so we can't always tell, even with our best theory, 
<br />
whether we have a case of information or not. On the other hand, this 
<br />
openness allows information theory to apply to systems that are not 
<br />
mechanical or algorithmic in the strictest sense of being Truing computable.
<br />
<p>This raises the issue of what we need in addition to information 
<br />
processing. A number of participants have held that meaning is essential to 
<br />
information, though the details are quite different. I therefore raised the 
<br />
question of whether the foundations of information science are in semiotics 
<br />
(or perhaps better, semiology), the theory of signs. This led to a focus on 
<br />
abduction as central to information theory. Now the relation between 
<br />
information science and semiotics could be of several kinds: 1) semiotics 
<br />
could be more basic than information, 2) information could be more basic 
<br />
than semiotics, 3) the two could go hand in hand, neither more fundamental 
<br />
than the other, or 4) the two could be independent but bear on certain 
<br />
aspects of the other. I don't see that which of 1-4 holds has been 
<br />
resolved, or even much addressed as yet.
<br />
<p>Andcution is clearly not a purely formal notion, so if it is essential to 
<br />
information science, or even required for a large part of information 
<br />
science, then it seems that there are further limits on the possibility of 
<br />
rigorous formalization of information science. In this case our ideal 
<br />
information theory may be not just undecidable, but irreducibly incomplete. 
<br />
If this is so, then no single formalization can capture all of information 
<br />
science. Again, there are costs and benefits to making this move.
<br />
<p>Pedro gave us an example of how abduction might be introduced at the 
<br />
molecular level by making a micro-meso-macro distinction. This is inherent 
<br />
in the information systems described in my own paper as required for 
<br />
information expression, so personally I agree with this, and have used the 
<br />
very words in other papers. Edwina objected to this categorization on the 
<br />
grounds that purpose cannot be constrained to the macro. I think we have a 
<br />
misunderstanding here. The terms macro, micro and meso are, as I understand 
<br />
Pedro's use, relative to what Stan Salthe calls the &quot;focal level&quot; of a 
<br />
system, and not absolute. This is consistent with the usage of Ingarden et 
<br />
al in Information Dynamics and Open Systems. Edwina's objection seems to me 
<br />
to assume an absolute standard of macroscopicity, etc. I don't think this 
<br />
is a good restriction, and I am unclear what it would mean in any case.
<br />
<p>We are still some way away from having consensus on how information can get 
<br />
meaning, but I think there is some agreement that although the relatively 
<br />
micro might contain information (or something weaker -- protoinformation, 
<br />
or potential information), and that the meso level is where the causal 
<br />
aspects of information are significant, a relatively macro level is 
<br />
required for the sort of integration necessary to make the causal aspects 
<br />
meaningful. I think that even if this is right, we are still some way from 
<br />
giving sufficient conditions, though Christophe Menant's paper addressed 
<br />
this issue from a similar perspective with his notion of &quot;system 
<br />
constraint&quot;. Althought this meaning of constraint is rather special, it is 
<br />
more neutral than &quot;abduction&quot; and &quot;meaning&quot;. I think it is best to try to 
<br />
use neutral terms insofar as possible (but we also have to make sure that 
<br />
we don't lose something important by using overly dry terminology). In any 
<br />
case, I would like to see some effort towards relating the notion of 
<br />
abduction, or perhaps meaning, to that of system constraint.
<br />
<p>So with that personal preference stated, I will wish you all a good holiday.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
<p>John
