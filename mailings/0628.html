<p>
Dear Juan:
<br />
<p>Thanks so much for the great examples. I agree with your classification
<br />
completely, and you have made everything so much clearer than I managed
<br />
to do!
<br />
<p>I have only a handful of minor quibbles.
<br />
<p>(1) I think you go a little too far when you say (in paragraph 3) that
<br />
&quot;there is no energy coupling between sender and receiver&quot; in a true
<br />
information-use scenario. Rather, I would say, the informational signal
<br />
must be very low in energy in relation to the energies involved in the
<br />
stability of the sender and receiver.
<br />
<p>At the observer end, the signal must be low-energy because that is the
<br />
whole point of information---to act as a guide and as a predictor for
<br />
the success of functional action. This purpose is defeated if the signal
<br />
itself disrupts the observer (as when we are blinded by the sun, for
<br />
example). At the observed-object side, the same principle applies, in
<br />
reverse. Inanimate objects do not care if they are destroyed, but we as
<br />
observers do. We must use a probe that does not destroy the object we
<br />
are observing if we wish to obtain useful information about it.  To be
<br />
sure, there are exceptions, in which we gather information from the way
<br />
in which things explode, but in general I think the rule holds. For the
<br />
most part, we want to know how things are and how they react in an
<br />
intact fashion, so a relatively low-energy probe is essential.
<br />
<p>On the other hand, SOME energy transfer is always required in order for
<br />
information to be gathered. There is no such thing as clarivoyance.
<br />
<p>(2) This is really a minor quibble---and, as I say, I think your
<br />
examples are great---but without a little elaboration, someone might
<br />
take away the impression that true information use is tied intrinsically
<br />
to brains, since you use the dog as your example of the transition from
<br />
force-type interactions to information-type interactions.
<br />
<p>I believe that the information-type interaction is an essential feature
<br />
of life as such, and that the bacterium is interacting with its
<br />
environment (and indeed its internal parts are interacting with each
<br />
other) according to essentially the same principles that the dog uses in
<br />
circling around the obstacle. I assume that you will agree with this
<br />
(no?), but I just wanted to get it out on the table to avoid any
<br />
possible misunderstandings.
<br />
<p>(3) Finally, you write (also in paragraph 3) &quot;Note that this class of
<br />
interactions must evolve; they cannot arise spontaneously in the abiotic
<br />
world.&quot;  Two remarks on this.
<br />
<p>First, if we are naturalists, we must assume that such interactions DID
<br />
evolve spontaneously in the abiotic world, even if we have no idea at
<br />
present how this was possible.
<br />
<p>Second (and here I may part company with you, and probably with most
<br />
others, as well), I do not think it helps much to invoke Darwinian
<br />
evolution, for the following reason. What we are talking about is a very
<br />
specific type of dynamical interaction. Therefore, we must seek to
<br />
understand it by investigating the spontaneous activity of the type of
<br />
matter that comprises the living state (namely, giant, frustrated,
<br />
metastable, and low-energy-trigger-dependent proteins coupled to an
<br />
ordered-water-phosphate gel matrix). Once we understand how the living
<br />
information interaction is possible, then we will probably have a much
<br />
deeper insight into how transitions from one stable state to another
<br />
(ontogenetic learning) are possible, and ultimately how such transitions
<br />
can become fixed in the genome (phylogenesis).
<br />
<p>I just don't think it helps very much to think along the lines of &quot;Well,
<br />
it all happened by accident somehow, and the organisms in which it
<br />
happened survived and the others didn't.&quot;  I think we have to try to do
<br />
better than that.
<br />
<p>I don't know whether you will agree with me on this last point, but I
<br />
think it is crucial, because the Darwinian mindset seems to me to be
<br />
blocking the path of progress (as Peirce liked to say) by fostering a
<br />
complacency that we already understand things about which in fact we
<br />
haven't a clue.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
<p>James
