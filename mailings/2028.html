                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Loet,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please allow me to argue further. Some of the cities in Saudi Arabia and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; UAE are very well equipped with the mentioned technological advances.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; However it is difficult to refer to Saudi Arabia as a knowledge based
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; economy. They have these things simply because they want them and can
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; afford them, not because these things make their economy (which is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; predominantly oil-based) more efficient. Similarly, in Russian Federation
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in my native city of St.Petersburg) the infrastructure has improved
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; drastically over the past several years -- precisely along with wealth
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; accumulation. It (and IT, excuse my pun) helps local businesses allright,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; but overwhelming majority of those just digest either oil money directly
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; or feed on the financial excrements of those who do (like selling
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers to oil companies or doing catering services to companies
                        selling
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers to oil companies).
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would also argue that the old USSR was to a degree a knowledge-based
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; economy (space industry, weapons production, etc), but did not have
                        enough
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; cash to maintain the infrastructure. Just one example. The universities
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; and colleges in St.Petersburg alone were producing about 1000 M.Sc in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physics every year, and similar numbers in Math, Philosophy, etc. As to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; M.Eng, their number could be counted in tens of thousands (there were 44
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; universities in St.Petersburg). Moscow was far bigger than that with its
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 85 universities. Needless to say that in the planned economy all these
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; people were employed, giving probably the highest proportion of educated
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; people in economy in the world. Did it help the USSR to win the economic
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the Cold War?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question of where did the initial wealth come from is also a bit
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguous. Several years ago Britain was selling parts of its golden
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; reserve, some 200 mln pounds I guess. These were ...... spanish dublons
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; acquired in the times of Sir Francis Drake who was one of the most
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful &quot;wealth importers&quot; in British history. I am pretty
                        sure that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is quite a bit of Calcutta gold in the British treasury. Sweden
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; prospered for quite a while spending the wealth miraculously acquired
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; during WWII. At the same time a good proportion of the German
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; panzerdivisions was made of Swedish steel or steel made from iron ore
                        from
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kiruna. Now the resource is spent and a very knowledge based economy of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sweden is in major difficulties. Germany also managed to recover only
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; through substantial financial aid from the world community. These facts
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not accusations -- history happened as it happened, but they might
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; form some basis against the concept of sustainability of knowledge-based
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; economy. I would also argue that scientists (especially liberal) in any
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; society, as in the fUSSR, as in modern Western civilization are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; subconsciously prone to theories that prove &quot;good values&quot; of
                        their
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; societies.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in my opinion (not very qualified, I admit), what in this
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion we call &quot;knowledge based&quot; economies are not such,
                        because
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge is not the ultimate flow that shares its energy and negentropy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the society but a system of tools to extract energy and negentropy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the ultimate flow which is, in the case of the Western world, the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; finance.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us first, for the sake of argument, define what we consider a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely knowledge-based economy. Suppose there is a country, A, which has
                        a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural resource(oil, gas, iron ore, etc). To process this resource this
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; country needs &quot; know-how&quot; and money. Suppose there is another
                        country, B,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; which has financial capacity to invest. Still not enough, the know-how is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; missing. Suppose there is the third country, C, which has neither finance
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; nor natural resource - just the know-how. Then A+B+C may form a viable
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; consortium to process the natural resources.In this consortium C is a
                        pure
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;knowledge-based&quot; economy.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this frame of thought is adopted, many interesting questions may
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; arise. For example,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) If B buys knowledge from C, does that make B knowledge-based
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; economy?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) If YES then does natural resource bought from A make B a resource
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; based economy?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) How knowledge is differen and how is it similar to natural resource
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; and financial resource?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Is knowledge a sustainable resource? On one hand, yes, as the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; know-how may be applied many times. On the other hand, no, because each
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; know-how is eventually &quot;broken into&quot; and the knowledge gradient
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissapears.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) Is any sustainability based on advantage or on competitive
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; advantage, i.e. is sustainability possible in the system of equal
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; partners, or some gradients are needed?

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Igor,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Question 1: Is it not true that the first paragraph here
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explains the second? NYC simply can afford the goodies listed
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in p2, and Calcutta can not?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, the knowledge-based economy is based on a period of wealth
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; accumulation
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the resource-based economy. At least, this has been the historical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; order.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once the transition is underway, it may spread at the global level
                        because
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a different diffusion dynamics. For example, more recently a city like
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bangkok or also many Chinese cities are taking part in the transition.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; One should not change the order of cause and effects in the model. The
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; economic question is, in my opinion: what generates wealth? If wealth
                        were
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated in Calcutta, one could afford to have a technological
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; infrastructure.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Question 2: Then if you give Calcutta the same amount of CASH
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (not knowledge, but CASH), it will soon have all the same
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things as NYC?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; NO: cash does not bring accumulation.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If YES then what you call Knowledge Based Economy is simply
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Wealth Based Economy. If NO we are back to protestant ethics
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thing against the Indian ethics.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My opinion: The sewage system and other goodies AS SUCH are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not the measure of sustainability. They become a measure of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sustainability ONLY to a degree in which they affect the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; efficiency of the local economic, business processes, when
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they simply help locals make money in some ways.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am afraid that these mechanisms are locally often beyond control.
                        Giving
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; people cash may help them in the short run, but not in the long run. The
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; quality of the (knowledge-based) plan of what to do with the cash, is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; crucial.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope that this is answering your questions.
