<p>
Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro Marijuan asked me to serve a chair in this FIS 2002 e-conference.
<br />
(The preamble of the FIS 2002 and all of the technical deails are found at
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="../../www.mdpi.net/fis2002/default.htm">http://www.mdpi.net/fis2002/</a>  ) Although I don't know exactly what the
<br />
role should be, I took liberty of saying something on a couple of papers as
<br />
a kickoff, and would like to see what would follow, of course, from both
<br />
sides of the pros and the cons.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I initially picked up three papers by John Collier, Andrei Igamberdiev
<br />
and Pedro Marijuan because of some familiarity of the subject matter to me.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I could get from John Collier's is in short &quot;One step backwards to
<br />
be
<br />
&nbsp;followed, hopefully, by two steps forwards&quot;. I am pretty sure that many
<br />
of us would now feel sick and tired about the issue of information because
<br />
the language to be employed for elucidating what information is all about is
<br />
already information-laden. One attempt at coping with the inevitable
<br />
complication associated with information which John took up is to make an
<br />
appeal to an expression of information, instead of its literal
<br />
representation.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John took so-called the internalist stance for expressing information
<br />
with recourse to the contrast between the possible and the actual. If one
<br />
takes the externalist position claiming that there is nothing new under the
<br />
sun, the burden of specifying what information is should solely be upon the
<br />
shoulder of the innocent company who is destined to receive it. Instead, the
<br />
possible which John focused anticipates serious negotiation between the
<br />
concerned parties, each of which has a very good reason vindicating its
<br />
own local position. John's physical information is about a sort of enigma
<br />
that looks actual towards the past, but possible towards the future. The
<br />
actual part of information is about the negotiation already settled, and the
<br />
possible part is about the current agenda on the table yet to be negotiated.
<br />
The absence of the global arbiter might be a serious drawback to some
<br />
one, but the very absence can furnish us with an open-end opportunity for
<br />
information-in-itself.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sharing almost the similar view, Pedro Marijuan came up with
<br />
revitalizing the idea of the invisible hand. If one looks at the miraculous
<br />
accomplishment that all of the concerned parties have jointly achieved so
<br />
far, it would seem as if guided by the invisible hand even in the absence of
<br />
the external arbiter. This is of course an anthropocentric metaphor in the
<br />
best sense of the word. The point in focus is, however, that a simple
<br />
bookkeeping between supplier and consumer is the sole means for tailoring
<br />
such an exquisite and unbelievable invisible hand. Adam Smith must have
<br />
anticipated what the 21st century would be going to accomplish in the name
<br />
of information.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei Igamberdiev faced, in a head-on manner, the material underpinning
<br />
of the bookkeeping between supplier and consumer. Material transaction is
<br />
the business of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly enough, Andrei turned the
<br />
standard practice of quantum mechanics totally upside down. Andrei's
<br />
internal quantum state is the one that can remain stable or robust as
<br />
against measurements proceeding internally. Although the standard quantum
<br />
mechanics has told us that the quantum wavefunction is extremely fragile
<br />
against the operation called measurement (e.g., a Schroedinger's cat), it
<br />
must also be quantum mechanics which is responsible for securing the
<br />
stability of our every-day material world. If quantum mechanics cannot meet
<br />
this challenge, our life would simply turn out to be a bad joke. Andrei has
<br />
set the agenda that internal quantum state must be about a necessary
<br />
infrastructure upholding the material world informationally.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information at the turn of the 21st century seems to be a thread
<br />
connecting physics, chemistry, biology and even economics. A common
<br />
denominator is serious negotiation between supplier and consumer.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
