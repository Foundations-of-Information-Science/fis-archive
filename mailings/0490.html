-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
Dear colleagues:
<br />
<p>It is high time that I enter this discussion. Unfortunately, this
<br />
electronic conference is coming smack right into a difficult period for
<br />
me: it began last week when I was just back in Alaska from spending several 
<br />
weeks in Argentina, and now I am at my regular tour at ICTP in Trieste as 
<br />
senior adviser. Add to this the editors of a book screaming for galley proof
<br />
corrections, the general assembly of the Oesterreichische Akademie der
<br />
Wissenschaften, etc., etc. In other words, I don't know how to make enough
<br />
room in my schedule while in Trieste!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Still, I do manage to follow with great interest the ongoing discussion. It
<br />
touches on many points raised in the first four sections of my
<br />
contribution (On the Concept of Information and its Role in Nature). I
<br />
realize that my paper is far too long, but I would appreciate it very much
<br />
getting some reactions and criticism from the participants to at least
<br />
sections 1-4.
<br />
<p>Concerning the ongoing discussion, let me turn specifically to the issue
<br />
of &quot;Does information play any role in purely physical (non-biotic)
<br />
interactions?&quot;, or, equivalently, &quot;Was there information before life?&quot;. I
<br />
try in my paper to justify negative answers to both questions. 
<br />
<p>I refer to the statement by Gyuri Darvas:
<br />
<p>&quot;When interacting with an other object, a physical object will first
<br />
'evaluate' the information .... E.g., a charge recognises the Coulomb
<br />
field of an other charge and will interact with it......&quot;
<br />
<p>I have difficulty to accept such language in physics. What part of the object
<br />
(or the particle) does the evaluating or the recognizing do? How much time
<br />
does
<br />
this process take? Likewise, what does it mean that &quot;..a given mass, when
<br />
it 'feels' a force, cannot make distinction that the source of this effect
<br />
was an other mass (gravitation) or an inertia force&quot;? (Leaving aside the
<br />
fact that this is a result of the proportionality between gravitational
<br />
mass and inertial mass, which a priori are different things). Let me
<br />
repeat here a statement from my paper (section 3): &quot;Unfortunately,
<br />
in physics we tend to use anthropomorphic analogies and animistic language
<br />
by saying such things as &quot;the system 'selects' a path of least action&quot;,
<br />
&quot;the system 'seeks' a strange attractor&quot;, or &quot;the photon 'decided' to go
<br />
through the left diffraction slit&quot;. One needs a brain to select, seek or
<br />
decide!&quot;. I also say: &quot;In a statement like 'the process of cosmic evolution 
<br />
itself generates information' (e.g., p. 131 in ref. 3 of my paper) we should 
<br />
realize that this is information for us observers--it does not control any of 
<br />
the natural processes involved unless they pertain to living matter. In a 
<br />
biological system, indeed, information is an active participant in its own 
<br />
organization, behavior and multiplication, and information exists and
<br />
operates 
<br />
in total independence of any outside observer&quot;.  
<br />
<p>Of course, we cannot forbid ourselves thinking in these terms--we do it
<br />
all the time. But applying the concept of information where it is not
<br />
necessary (though perfectly possible given our cognitive apparatus which
<br />
happens to work with it) is like insisting in the use of a clearly
<br />
defined, but physically worthless, quantity such as 1/3 mv**3. 
<br />
<p>Please note that in the paper I start my discussion by turning to the process 
<br />
of &quot;interaction&quot; (between two given systems) as the departing point, as the 
<br />
most basic concept. I feel that only in this way can one avoid several
<br />
semantic 
<br />
and subjective difficulties--as happened when Ernst Mach introduced it in 
<br />
fundamental Newtonian dynamics.
<br />
<p>Looking forward to your comments,
<br />
<p>Cheers, Juan
