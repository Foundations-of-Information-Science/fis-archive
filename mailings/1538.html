<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;A small suggestion for discussion:

When order and other concepts are defined in a quantitative way (how 
<br />
much is it?) and relative way (which one has more chaos?), very simple

examples should be given.

<br />
<p>I was a bit surprised by the lack of direct discussion by this group 
<br />
concerning the intriguing issue of opposition between grouping and 
<br />
symmetry, in part because I assume most here are aware of Shu-Kun's 
<br />
correlation between symmetry and entropy. Can entropy simultaneously 
<br />
correlate with disorder as prescribed by Boltzmann (the second law). I 
<br />
can explain that the disintegration of grouping is invariably toward 
<br />
symmetry, not disorder. One response took notice but then it seemed like 
<br />
responses were toward silencing further discussion.
<br />
<p>Perhaps the specific issue of exclusivity, the either/or of grouping 
<br />
(order) and symmetry (order) could be analyzed properly and discussed. I 
<br />
pointed out the simple principle that a set of objects can either group 
<br />
together or spread out more evenly. The most simple example I gave was 
<br />
of dots along a straight line. There is no need to limit the frame of 
<br />
reference. The dots can only either move toward or move apart. Break any 
<br />
dot into smaller pieces, symmetry has increased, not disorder. 
<br />
Disintegration of grouping invariably leads to integration with the 
<br />
reference frame, in this case fusing together to become a continuous line.
<br />
<p><p><p>The dots on a line analogy can be improved by using red and blue dots, 
<br />
to suggest positive and negative, and simplified by closing the line 
<br />
into a circle (a closed system). The dots are still restricted to the 
<br />
line. The diagram above (or click here) 
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../macrocosmicsymmetry.com/transition.gif">http://macrocosmicsymmetry.com/transition.gif</a>&gt; shows a range of 
<br />
possible patterns between two extremes where the colors are polarized on 
<br />
opposite sides (grouped) shown in pattern A versus the two colors 
<br />
fused/blended/disintegrated/mixed into the neutrality of perfect 
<br />
symmetry in this model in pattern H. Note that each pair of dots in F 
<br />
then G repeats this process of disintegration and reintegration which in 
<br />
extreme becomes H. Note the grouping in E compared to F. Which has 
<br />
greater symmetry order? The grouping in E draws the pattern away from 
<br />
increased symmetry.
<br />
<p>In my original post &lt;<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/1523.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/1523.html</a>&gt; I 
<br />
explained the same either/or principle also with checkers, as it is more 
<br />
applicable to three dimensions, showing how the intermediary stage 
<br />
between two orders merely appears to be generally disordered. Using game 
<br />
pieces on a checkerboard, moving from the original grouping of the 
<br />
checkers toward matching the symmetry of the board, any move either 
<br />
increases grouping or increases symmetry. Simply imagine switching any 
<br />
two adjacent squares of a checkerboard. The symmetry of the board is 
<br />
obviously decreased yet there are four like colored squares then 
<br />
grouped. Any move in which grouping disintegrates is invariably toward 
<br />
the symmetry of the checkerboard pattern.
<br />
<p>Maximum symmetry order is perfect balance, integration, combination, 
<br />
uniformity, homogeneity, singularity, formlessness, symmetry, and unity 
<br />
in reference to the whole system or any limited frame. While grouping 
<br />
order involves division, separation, distinction, individuality, 
<br />
density, pronunciation, opposition, and conflict also in the whole 
<br />
system or limited frame. The definition of chaos is a whole other issue. :)
<br />
<p>All could at least appreciate here that disorder (if there was such a 
<br />
property) could only exist between extremes of perfect grouping and 
<br />
perfect symmetry. That is the first step. But notice pattern D in the 
<br />
image, necessary in the transition from C to E. Pattern D is meant here 
<br />
to represent the myriad of irregular (disordered) patterns which exist 
<br />
at this stage of the transition between two orders. Observing the 
<br />
transition, one is led to question whether pattern D is disordered or is 
<br />
it actually a blend of grouping and symmetry? What is disorder in 
<br />
reference to grouping in pattern A? What is disorder in reference to 
<br />
symmetry in patterns FG and H? Perhaps this is why order and disorder 
<br />
are not considered opposites in some corners of mathematics or why 
<br />
different measures of order and disorder emerge.
<br />
<p>Note most importantly that what is being proposed is simply a logical 
<br />
extension of Shu-Kun's correlation between symmetry and entropy to 
<br />
include in contrast to symmetry increasing with time, a precise model of 
<br />
grouping order. If entropy increase marks the arrow of time, and 
<br />
symmetry increases with time, what does that indicate about the order of 
<br />
the past? What is order without symmetry? Grouping order portrays the 
<br />
transition toward ever decreasing symmetry to the maximum extreme of 
<br />
opposite polarities.
<br />
<p>It helps to imagine a contrast gradient which reveals how all patterns 
<br />
(states) are necessarily bounded by extremes. Any image can be pushed to 
<br />
high contrast where there is an opposition of two colors, usually white 
<br />
and black, or low contrast where the image blends to one color, usually 
<br />
gray. Grouping order is synonymous with high contrast, while symmetry 
<br />
(entropy) is synonymous with low contrast. Only in between these 
<br />
extremes do we find the infinite variety of possible states or patterns, 
<br />
but the whole set is infinite only between extremes, between boundary 
<br />
states. The space of all possible states forms the volume of a football, 
<br />
with extremes of grouping and symmetry at each end, with smooth (low 
<br />
contrast) and lumpy (high contrast) extremes at every point along the 
<br />
gradient between, forming the shape in accordance with the measure of 
<br />
possible states at any average cosmological density. The extreme of 
<br />
smoothness at any average cosmological density is obvious and the 
<br />
contrast gradient exemplifies the opposite extreme of lumpiness. Maybe I 
<br />
am getting away from a simple example here but not really. In cosmology 
<br />
there are physical extremes of the singularity of the big bang and 
<br />
absolute zero, i.e., the stretched perfectly flat empty space, a 
<br />
physical reality in the Big Rip scenario outlined recently by Caldwell 
<br />
of Dartmouth.
<br />
<p>In regards to entropy correlating either with symmetry or disorder, 
<br />
there is a vague assumption surrounding the second law which implies 
<br />
there is a never ending supply of disordered states in respect to the 
<br />
deep time of cosmological evolution, first due to the idea of more 
<br />
disordered states having been applied as a cause for the arrow of time 
<br />
(Eddington), and second due to past predictions that time never ends in 
<br />
an ever expanding universe. The issue of where absolute zero fits into 
<br />
this model, or if a balance eventually ensues, has never really been 
<br />
explored properly. In recognizing distinct boundary states, one 
<br />
recognizes that possibilities toward the future are not unbounded, and 
<br />
thus the set of all possible states is divisible, in which case 
<br />
eventually if systems are probabilistic then all possible states must 
<br />
balance out, with either order/disorder, grouping/symmetry, or 
<br />
positive/negative groups on either side of the final state of the 
<br />
evolved system. Which is it? Positive/negative of course.
<br />
<p>The arrow of time is clearly moving toward symmetry, entropy, balance, 
<br />
not disorder. Once we start looking for a balance point in state space 
<br />
the unavoidable conclusion is that it is absolute zero, a universe 
<br />
stretched flat, i.e., perfect symmetry. That conclusion is strongly 
<br />
supported by the discovery of accelerating expansion. Zero is the great 
<br />
attractor. Yet in order for absolute zero to be the balance of all 
<br />
states, there has to be an identical but inverse set of states, a 
<br />
positive and a negative side, as perhaps we might have expected 
<br />
mathematically. So hypothetically the big bang of an anti-matter 
<br />
space-time would begin from a dense point that is negative in reference 
<br />
to our positive past, while both systems move toward the same 
<br />
equilibrium state.
<br />
<p>Loet, I apologize if not but I thought your paper was of similar focus 
<br />
and invariably toward formulating this same model of two orders. The 
<br />
algorithms for precise clustering is excellent work. There are I expect 
<br />
algorithms capable of expressing the transition between grouping order 
<br />
and symmetry order which would predict for example spiral galaxy 
<br />
formations, which are perhaps the cleanest cosmological example of 
<br />
grouping and symmetry in opposition yet structurally working together.
