Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>John poses an excellent question:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A central hypothesis is that correspondence relations between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;algebraic species and organic species generate a robust basis for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;message specificity and sensitivity.  I presuppose that category 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory is a suitable mathematical framework for a general theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q5. Must this correspondence be such that organic species resemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational &quot;agents&quot; as used in Alife programs, in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication is fully formalized in terms of explicit rules 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(&quot;methods&quot;)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>It is not easy to respond directly to John's  question.  I will seek 
<br />
to answer it from an engineering perspective and from a biological 
<br />
perspective.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Communication in the sense that I use it in this extended abstract is 
<br />
used as a relation among two or more systems; two or more domains of 
<br />
reference.  The process of organic communication in natural systems 
<br />
admits multiple dynamics to form (biological plasticity or 
<br />
adaptability or flexibility) .  One type of dynamic can be called 
<br />
&quot;error&quot; if one has created a norm that admits a variance from that 
<br />
norm.  Thus, organic communication can admit error in the process of 
<br />
generating a message, in the process of transmitting the message or 
<br />
in the process of responding to the message.
<br />
<p>Formally, these are merely alternative dynamics within a living 
<br />
system; the notion of &quot;error&quot; is a normative value imposed by an 
<br />
external source.  Note that in the case of the engineering 
<br />
information of Shannon, one system generates a message, thus a &quot;true&quot; 
<br />
message is said to exist.  This &quot;true&quot; message becomes the basis of 
<br />
the &quot;encoding&quot; prior to transmission and &quot;decoding&quot; after reception. 
<br />
Shannon's theory thus creates a sequence of four systems, each with a 
<br />
special task and the performance of that task can be evaluated in 
<br />
terms of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  By presupposing that each of the systems 
<br />
for message generation, transmission, reception and interpretation 
<br />
functions can be constructed exactly as needed to transmit a &quot;truth 
<br />
value&quot;, Shannon can introduce yet another system.  This 5 th system 
<br />
functions solely to create errors, but only errors in the 
<br />
transmission process, leaving the other four systems to function 
<br />
truthfully.
<br />
<p>The utility of Shannon's system's engineering is without question. 
<br />
&nbsp;From an efficiency perspective, the efficiency of creating five 
<br />
systems, (one solely for the purpose of making errors,) in order to 
<br />
transmit a message would not normally be considered as good 
<br />
engineering practise.  The inefficiency of the design principle is 
<br />
offset by the advantages gained from the efficiency of the 
<br />
transmission process and the capability to transmit over unlimited 
<br />
distances.
<br />
<p>The natural history of living systems created an efficient form of 
<br />
message transmission.  The generating function is one set of organic 
<br />
components.  The transmitted message is another organic component. 
<br />
The response generating function is still another set of organic 
<br />
components.  All of these functional components collaborate (work 
<br />
together in a thermodynamic sense). The system functions locally. 
<br />
This internal collaboration negates the need for a separate system to 
<br />
generate errors.  (From a cynical perspective, one could say modern 
<br />
management methods are foreign to biological design.  :-)  )
<br />
<p>For these reasons, I do not see a significant relation between the 
<br />
&quot;Alife&quot; usage of agents and the sorts of generating functions used by 
<br />
natural systems.
<br />
<p>A second aspect of John's question concerns the nature of applied 
<br />
mathematics.  Within the framework of the axioms of category theory, 
<br />
a wide range of mathematic systems (species) of logic have been 
<br />
developed by PURE mathematicians.  Traditionally, APPLIED 
<br />
mathematicians have restricted the usage of mathematical species to a 
<br />
few popular choices - such as linear vector spaces or highlighted a 
<br />
particular aspect of one of the species used, for example  group 
<br />
theory or probability theory.
<br />
<p>The natural emergence of organic communication appears to be 
<br />
&quot;spontaneous&quot;.  I am not aware that any  a priori restriction was 
<br />
placed on either the  organic species chosen to be transmitted or on 
<br />
the mathematical species used to represent the organic species.  In 
<br />
separate work, I am describing the organic message in terms of a 
<br />
novel mathematical species - a special form of a bipartite graph. 
<br />
(&quot;Graph&quot; here means a logical triplet - a set of nodes, a set of 
<br />
edges and a set of ordered pairs that matches the edges and the nodes 
<br />
to form a &quot;network&quot;.)  This mathematical species is rare; indeed, I 
<br />
have not yet found a single reference to it in the mathematical 
<br />
literature.  But then, I have not conducted an exhaustive search.
<br />
<p>I am uncertain as to the precise meaning of John's &quot;fully formalized&quot; 
<br />
in the context of this question.  If a system is formalized, it seems 
<br />
to me that it is &quot;fully formalized&quot;. Organic messages can flow in 
<br />
living systems.  Are living systems &quot;fully formalizable&quot;?  Must all 
<br />
messages be &quot;fully formalized&quot; before the system is formalized?  This 
<br />
terminology raises questions about physics and mathematics that are 
<br />
not particularly germane to organic communication and the 
<br />
collaborative efforts within the organic community.  The prosperity 
<br />
of the organic  community need not be directly related to the 
<br />
formalizability of the mathematical species chosen to describe the 
<br />
dynamics.  Indeed, I can imagine circumstances where a toxic chemical 
<br />
is metabolized to generate a huge number of &quot;errors&quot; that are 
<br />
transmitted throughout the systems.  From a mathematical perspective, 
<br />
such a toxic chemical would introduce a high level of 
<br />
non-stationarity into the natural system.  Nevertheless, the organism 
<br />
may continue to prosper in the presence of a toxic compound, provided 
<br />
other circumstances are sufficient to sustain a normal dynamic within 
<br />
the organism.  It is thus unclear how the mathematical / physical 
<br />
notion of &quot;formalizable&quot; is related to biological / organic 
<br />
communication or to the prosperity of life.
<br />
<p>Perhaps someone else can suggest a reason why &quot;formalizability &quot; is 
<br />
important in natural systems.
<br />
<p>Cheers to all
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
