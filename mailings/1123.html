Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>Around the end of next week (at their convenience) Jerry Chandler &amp; Luis 
<br />
Serra will convoke us for the new session on &quot;Information and Ecological 
<br />
Economics&quot;. During the remaining days, it would be good that invitees and 
<br />
participants in the current session on Molecular Recognition would make 
<br />
their concluding comments. In any case the list is wide open to whatsoever 
<br />
themes and suggestions.
<br />
<p>all the best
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. For travel reasons I will be unable to handle any technical problem of 
<br />
the list until next 15 October.
<br />
_____________________________________
<br />
<p>In what follows I include some closing comments, mainly in response to 
<br />
Soeren and Loet:
<br />
<p>Considering the cell as a membrane system (Soeren) is indeed an exciting 
<br />
new research-direction. A recent issue of BioSystems is devoted to 
<br />
&quot;membrane computing&quot;, or P-systems (from Paun, the founder of this new 
<br />
field). It appears as a very promising approach to the formal properties of 
<br />
cellular communication --quite apart from classical approaches based on 
<br />
information theory, cellular automata, Turing machine, etc.
<br />
<p>Biologically, communication means that the cell cycle itself &quot;pops in and 
<br />
out&quot; of the cell membrane in order to get an adaptive coupling with the 
<br />
boundary conditions of the system. As already argued, this phenomenon is 
<br />
the linchpin that distinguishes the informational coupling of life to its 
<br />
boundary conditions from the mechanical coupling (through force) of the 
<br />
inanimate. Of course, we may cut communication adrift from the reality of 
<br />
the cell-cycle (and so get it in a very simplified way, eg, Shannonian way 
<br />
as Loet suggested) but then we pay the heavy price of a complete 'meaning' 
<br />
disappearance... and we leave information only as an abstract construct or 
<br />
metrics that is definitely separated from life's own structures. Well, it 
<br />
can be done, but we renounce to a coherent informational view of the cell 
<br />
(and of other 'informational' entities).
<br />
<p>The big biomolecular challenge is in my opinion to study communication (the 
<br />
signalome) in its coordination with the cell cycle --itself a dense 
<br />
intermix of very different information architectures, mainly the sequential 
<br />
(genome, transcriptome) and the amorphous (proteome, metabolome, 
<br />
degradome).  This discussion is an important part of contemporary 
<br />
bioinformatic needs, and here at fis, we have found an original path to 
<br />
contemplate the whole panorama. Starting with molecular recognition (thanks 
<br />
to Shu-Kun for his valuable insights) we can put a lot of explanatory 
<br />
weight to the three fis 'information genera'. Several schemes presented 
<br />
here, for instance,  by Jerry, Karl, Michael, and quite recently by Loet, 
<br />
etc. might produce good results to study the functional mix between the 
<br />
generative and the structural--the heart of the cell cycle). And finally we 
<br />
should advance towards a new consideration of the cell cycle itself, 
<br />
conceived as a succesion of 'phases' . In the definition of these phases 
<br />
that substitute for 'states' in the biological realm, there appear further 
<br />
conceptual difficulties, mainly because of the many multiplicities of 
<br />
equi-final regimes that may be contained (my best candidate notion to 
<br />
establish the phase 'variables' would be Robert Rosen proposal in his essay 
<br />
'what is life: the Schrodinger question 50 years later'... it is a 
<br />
particular anecdote, but this essay appeared earlier, and in a more 
<br />
complete rendering, into a Spanish Journal --in 1994, in Spanish of course)
<br />
<p>Anyhow, I am getting too long in my farewell to this exciting discussion. 
<br />
Let me add that re-reading the recent messages another future discussion to 
<br />
organize should revolve around entropy --the numerous misunderstandings, 
<br />
misconceptions, etc. surrounding it, precisely in its connection with 
<br />
Shannon (for instance, arguing with Loet, thermodynamic entropy is indeed 
<br />
'dimensionless': it has units, but no dimensions, as 'temperature' itself 
<br />
has dimensions of energy--see John Collier excellent posting in this list 
<br />
about the subject-- and so they cancel each other). I also would like to 
<br />
argue with Soeren on autopoiesis: does it really make molecular sense? 
<br />
Maybe in the session with Jerry and Luis both entropy and autopoiesis will 
<br />
somehow reappear... it would be great returning a little to these 
<br />
bioinspired themes.        best ---Pedro.
