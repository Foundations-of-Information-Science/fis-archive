Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>After Bob's eloquent claims in his last message, I cannot help but
<br />
recognizing (once more) the centrality of the VEMS idea concerning the
<br />
evolution of social complexity... VEMS have supposed a great start for our
<br />
socioinfo discussion, and have proven to be a terrific catalyst for
<br />
adumbrating the interconnections between fitness, morals, ethics, social
<br />
evolution, consciousness, economics, etc. I also agree that several weeks
<br />
of patient exchange and tutorials in between the different scientific
<br />
perspectives would be quite enticing, and really necessary. But ours is not
<br />
a fashionable topic (at least at the time being) and financing that type of
<br />
retreat looks an impossible task. Perhaps in the future things will
<br />
change...
<br />
<p>Such a number of issues have been related these days to the socioinfo
<br />
matters that venturing oneself again into the discussion is really
<br />
frightening (I understand very well what you say about that, Bob). Anyhow,
<br />
here there are a couple of points:
<br />
<p>The &quot;fluidity&quot; of the social and biological stuff is a &quot;calculated&quot; one. It
<br />
is the result of optimization processes running across scores of
<br />
specialized accounting entities: particularly from cellular signaling
<br />
systems to brain substructures and social institutions. I mean, there is
<br />
not a mere decay that has to be compensated in an &quot;autopietic&quot; or metabolic
<br />
manner, but a (really) calculated integration of opposing
<br />
constructive-destructive activities coupled in an endlessly variable way...
<br />
the amazing (financial &amp; productive) accounting processes within a
<br />
company's life --remember that just only one out of the ten new ones will
<br />
survive more than one year-- are mirrored (so to speak) within our brains,
<br />
within each of our cells... It wonders me that power laws emerge as a
<br />
widespread outcome in most of these calculated fluidities. Please, do not
<br />
ask me why--Bak and Scarrott have given two very different responses
<br />
(hopefully, thanks to Soeren's and his journal courtesy, we will be able to
<br />
connect with Scarrott's paper through the fis site. then we can re-discuss
<br />
this matter)
<br />
<p>About the role of several crucial inventions in the evolution of biological
<br />
complexity, particularly computers in the present &quot;info revolution&quot; (is
<br />
in't obvious that they have been the RELEVANT factor?, like printed books
<br />
were for renaissance and the scientific revolution, and steam engines were
<br />
for industrial revolution--of course this does not mean ONLY factor). But
<br />
beyond discussing on adjectives or adverbs, my point is that mostly through
<br />
these new artifacts, (as so often in history) we have unleashed powerful
<br />
economic-politic-cultural &quot;globalization&quot; forces changing our societies far
<br />
beyond our own understanding and social control... Coupled with the
<br />
inexorable problem of the ecological limits that the industrial societies
<br />
have stumbled upon, this means that the tasks ahead are too big and too
<br />
urgent for the very modest &quot;global brain&quot; that we are simultaneously
<br />
building thanks to these new technologies. Our survival problems seem to be
<br />
growing faster than our problem-solving capabilites...
<br />
<p>Perhaps the two presenters originally planned (Tom and Wolfang) would like
<br />
to say something about that.
<br />
<p>bests
<br />
<p>Pedro
