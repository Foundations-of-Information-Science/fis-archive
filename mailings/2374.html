Dear All,
<br />
<p>Should we keep discussing the Prolegomena on info &amp; ethics or should we 
<br />
jump into the concrete questions about the contemporary revolution of info 
<br />
technologies? Apologies for being focused again in the former, hopefully it 
<br />
will help to produce more interesting answers about the latter...
<br />
<p>If ethics is related to a collective dimension of an individual's 
<br />
&quot;fitness&quot;  (within a complex society), and if we suppose that fitness 
<br />
itself is amenable to formal/informational treatments (or will be in a 
<br />
foreseeable future), it seems difficult not to conclude on some form of 
<br />
informational reductionism on ethics. However, I feel in a strong 
<br />
disagreement with that apparent reductionist conclusion derived from my own 
<br />
responses to the opening text. So, let me backtrack.
<br />
<p>In a complex society, any individual's action may be subject to scrutiny on 
<br />
very different grounds: say as immoral, unprofitable (non-economic), 
<br />
unjust, unethical...  The &quot;moral&quot; ground is usually understood as very 
<br />
close to the core of human condition, related to human nature itself (that 
<br />
&quot;zoe&quot; pointed out by Rafael), and then understood slightly different from 
<br />
the classical view in philosophy. Religions have been the traditional 
<br />
providers of the moral sense in almost every society: eg, the very clear 
<br />
ruling in the Ten Commandments of Christianity. Going to the &quot;economic&quot; 
<br />
ground, it is highly regimented and abstract, wrapped in strict accounting 
<br />
procedures (curiously related to the historical origins of numbers, 
<br />
algebra, symmetry...) and purports a high level of formal abstraction, 
<br />
notwithstanding its apparent immediateness. Then the &quot;legal system&quot; appears 
<br />
as another grid, formally structured too, which attempts to make a 
<br />
procedural &quot;map&quot; of almost any human action, particularly in the situations 
<br />
amenable to conflict.
<br />
<p>Ethics would be different. Ethics implies the realization that none of the 
<br />
previous grids to map human action has fulfilled its mission globally, in 
<br />
achieving a &quot;total&quot; vision of the social behavior of the person. Some 
<br />
concrete actions of a person may be moral, profitable, and legal---but they 
<br />
may not be ethical after all. In bioethics (or in info ethics) we might 
<br />
point out very concrete, contemporary cases.
<br />
<p>Ethics means that the formal schemes of other disciplinary realms have 
<br />
failed (either economic, legal, or moral---well, &quot;moral&quot;, as least in the 
<br />
common sense I have taken it,  representing the proto-group acceptable 
<br />
behavior for collective survival, is not necessarily formal after all, but 
<br />
quite often it has little to say relating a complex social setting). 
<br />
Overall those regimentations of behavior would have failed to provide 
<br />
sufficient convergence or &quot;closure&quot; on the social interests. Actually any 
<br />
human community becomes too complicated and variable to yield its &quot;secrets&quot; 
<br />
to any bureaucratic, economic, legal, scientific, etc. formulae --am 
<br />
following J.C. Scott, 1998.
<br />
<p>Ethics, then, would explore the &quot;irreducible&quot; residues of the common good 
<br />
which have not been detected by those other formal grids. Ethics explores 
<br />
particularly the new phenomena, the new techs, the new problems, the new 
<br />
achievements, as they impinge on the social fabric... those very events 
<br />
that will be a matter of legislation and economic ruling in a pretty near 
<br />
future. But, how could ethics achieve its focus on the unfocussed matters? 
<br />
How would social collectives dramatize those new strange, unruled, 
<br />
conflicting events? Drama, poetry, music... would they be a good social 
<br />
tool in order to feel the unknown, to visualize it, to anticipate it? I 
<br />
think so.
<br />
<p>We are lead again to that discussion on &quot;meaning and art&quot; ... where I 
<br />
subscribe a good portion of Lauri's dictum weeks ago: &quot;arts are 
<br />
technologies of ethics&quot;. Maybe it could be said differently, but the 
<br />
exploration direction looks intriguing.
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
