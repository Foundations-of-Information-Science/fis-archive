Dear Andrei,
<br />
<p><p><p>I really like your way of being scientist: you dare to state your point of 
<br />
view and do it very well.
<br />
<p><p><p>I hope you don't mind if I take it as an opportunity to try to push the 
<br />
borders of our discussion a bit further and look forward to your reactions. 
<br />
The point of departure is that you according to your latest posting as a 
<br />
realist readily admit that social consensus is the basis of modern science - 
<br />
or at least physics.
<br />
<p><p><p>This very situation opens up an alternate way to consider the realist's 
<br />
dilemma - since the measurement problem I posed there has been met with no 
<br />
response. Today's alternative connects to comprehending causality as 
<br />
mentioned by Ted (posted 06-06-03) that draw attention to Kolmogorov that 
<br />
spanned two traditions in mathematical philosophy:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One which is based in numbers and asserts that science is a matter of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measurement, and a second tradition which asserts that science is a matter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &gt;comprehending causality (causality &gt;in this context being a matter of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical explication).
</em><br />
<p><p><p>So let us now turn to comprending causality (instead of measurement as in 
<br />
the realist's dilemma):
<br />
<p><p><p>If one admits social consensus is the very basis of science - in lack of 
<br />
other alternatives - then one admits the primacy of subjectivity (i.e., that 
<br />
a decision has to be made at the level of the knowing subject before he can 
<br />
even participate in any group decision on social consensus). The knowing 
<br />
subject is thus the FIRST DECIDER (which is the base line of SOA) in acts of 
<br />
decisions. And now you admit that consensus is the only basis of scientific 
<br />
decision - that is decisions based on a pure belief. Call an object X; then 
<br />
the (model) decision &quot;X is real&quot; is made on a pure subjective belief and 
<br />
such acts of pure subjective beliefs are THEN (afterwards) made consensual 
<br />
by a social group decision. However X can be (appoint) an object, a state 
<br />
transition, reality . you name it .the procedure is exactly the same.
<br />
<p><p><p>The point is that here the first and ultimate decider is the INDIVIDUAL 
<br />
SUBJECT and nothing else and the place of this decision (the subject's mind) 
<br />
is the point from where are all discussions about CAUSES must proceed. Not 
<br />
the other way around as practised in classical science - which proceeds from 
<br />
the idea that state transitions (as part of properties) are the CAUSE of 
<br />
mind impressions !!!! There is no one &quot;out there&quot; to make a unbiased 
<br />
decision about such an eventual state transition occuring in a point P in 
<br />
space-time!  The model we usually construe of this very process is a 
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;signal&quot; that has to travel all the way to human consciousness and on the 
<br />
way through my perceptual apparatus it is multiply feed-back - in a way that 
<br />
actually can make state transitions to &quot;disappear&quot; (anyhow so it looks like 
<br />
in the realist's way of reasoning). However this situation totally ruins our 
<br />
possibility to make certain causal deductions.
<br />
<p><p><p>THIS MEANS A FORCED ON REVERSAL OF THE DIRECTION OF CAUSAL CONSTRUCTION 
<br />
(CAUSATION) - THAT IN ONE BLOW DECLARE NUGATORY TOTAL THE CELEBRATED THIRD 
<br />
PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE OF CLASSICAL SCIENCE - AND SUCH A REVERSAL HAS 
<br />
DEEP-GOING CONSEQUENCES FOR SCIENTIFIC REASONING.
<br />
<p><p><p>Such a reversal of causation also resolves the realist's dilemma - or maybe 
<br />
it is better to say that a reversed direction of causation must be imposed 
<br />
on our reasoning because of the human capacity of observation (and the fact 
<br />
it is deeply feed-back connected). In that view you can stay realist if you 
<br />
want - one simply has to redefine &quot;real&quot; into &quot;actual&quot;, so when you say the 
<br />
&quot;real world&quot; you refer to the &quot;actual world&quot; as it appears to you in your 
<br />
experience, i.e., your PRIVERSE. BUT .. this  priverse is by no means unique 
<br />
or unary - this is your personal world PRIVERSE :: this is your experience 
<br />
:: and you are on the train to Copenhagen becoming an &quot;actualist&quot; (please 
<br />
let us look upon this catch-term as a joke!)
<br />
<p><p><p>In short: All scientific decisions rely on social consensus that implies a 
<br />
foregoing personal subjective decision. This decision is based on pure 
<br />
belief - in the lack of a certain experimental account. Such a realisation 
<br />
will not make science worse - on the contrary it will for the first time (?) 
<br />
inject consistency into our reasoning. It will not undermine science - since 
<br />
science will operate very well as a tool of prediction - a tool to predict 
<br />
what is going to happen to my coming experience (and OUR coming experience 
<br />
in case we are tuned into the consensus of the group). However it will cause 
<br />
turbulence to mankind's frequent abuse of the truth and objectivity 
<br />
conception.
<br />
<p>This is also why information rises first in a human mind and as a mean of 
<br />
conceptualisating (grasping/explicating) his own FEELS - well . the &quot;inside 
<br />
version of signal&quot; cannot be portrayed in any more telling way. But since 
<br />
the society by education and upbringing has tuned the scientist's mind to 
<br />
think and conceptualise in a way that allows for intersubjective 
<br />
communication - we all can understand his model (what he says) reasonably 
<br />
well.
<br />
<p><p><p>However the bottom line is CONSENSUS - not a pre-given reality (!!!!) and 
<br />
this make a great difference - at least to my mind.
<br />
<p><p><p>Best wishes
<br />
<p>Arne

<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;       Dear Arne,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are dicussing the possibility to classify fields and information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as  REAL - and \&quot;existing\&quot; on an equal level as of REALITY - as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to&gt; something else...experience I guess.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Does this means you both both think it is consistently possible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; classifying phenomena of science into the dichomoty REAL/UNREAL (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eventually MATERIAL/UNMATERIAL)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any event I speak not about the dichomoty MATERIAL/UNMATERIAL.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main point of my Email was that the modern physics shows that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditiotal distinction MATERIAL/UNMATERIAL is not so sharp as was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believed. I again advertise reality as reality of fields (classical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum). Fields are not more localized in the space. So I would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to consider fields as material structures, but as information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures. D. Bohm and B. Hiley in their book Undivided Universe had a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar viewpoint. They interpreted teh pilot wave in the Bohmian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics as a purely information field. I did teh same in my book and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; congnition was described in terms of information fields.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The dichomoty REAL/UNREAL  -- yes!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I mean do you think is it possible to come to such a distinction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomena on grounds of an obsevation science??
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In in this case on what criteria could such a distinction possibly be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uphold?&gt; Do you expect a possible experimental \&quot;proof\&quot;? Like the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physicists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; strive for an experiemental \&quot;proof\&quot; of Bell\'s inequality for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; instance?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No I do not expect a purely experimental proof. There should be created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a model. Then we should test if it matches the experimental data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we can never prove that a model is correct through the experimental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data (Poper\'s thesis), but we can reject our model if it does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; match  data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Or can such a \&quot;proof\&quot; only be established by a social convention -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consensus? In this case a matter of consesual belief. And how do we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proceed from this very point?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a problem. Yes, modern science works in such a way. But there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reality which is independent of consesual belief. Soon or later this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality will go into teh contradiction with a social agreement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as we have seen it could take hundreds and even thousands of years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The SOA\'s line of arguing is that real/unreal distinction can only be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; grounded on social convention - i.e., a definition that is generally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accepted but cannot be (ap)proved in a science based on experimental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evidence. (The realist\'s dilemma is an attempt to show that human\'s
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; capacity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of perception is the cause that make this outcome a necessity.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However a decision in consensus can only be achieved in the case each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; individual participating in this act of consesual decision has made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; up his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind, ie made a private decision in the matter under consideration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; why science has to take off form the individual subject\'s point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the subject-oriented approach (SOA) - and accordingly make a strict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the first person\'s view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, modern science is SOA, I agree. But it does not imply that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everybody should accept such a social agreement. I organized 9 large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internatonal conferences on quantum foundations, about 600 people. Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of them have doubts in the conventional interpretation of QM, in spite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the fact that we all formally accept it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the best, Andrei
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
