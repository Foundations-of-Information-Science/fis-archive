                <p>
                    Dear Steven,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Do you mean with &quot;embodied&quot; embodiments in biological bodies or in bodies of
                    <br />
                    knowledge. I find it very difficult to understand that meaning has to be
                    <br />
                    embodied if this is meant biologically. However, I can accept that meaning
                    <br />
                    is systemic and thus potentially different among bodies of knowledge.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    How does this relate to information processing? If one distinguishes between
                    <br />
                    (Shannon-type) information processing and meaning-processing (e.g., in the
                    <br />
                    generation of knowledge), the uncertainty has to be positioned within the
                    <br />
                    meaning processing system as meaningful information (different from
                    <br />
                    Shannon-type information). Investing meaning to an information can then be
                    <br />
                    considered as an operation of the selecting system. The operation is
                    <br />
                    recursive: some meanings are more meaningful than others given a body of
                    <br />
                    knowledge. Knowledge can again be communicated as discursive knowledge.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    This is all relatively independent of the bodies involved. They provide the
                    <br />
                    historical conditions for an evolutionary process of expectations operating
                    <br />
                    selectively upon one another. Of course, the historical conditions matter
                    <br />
                    because they set the stage for this cultural evolution.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>Dear Pedro and list,
                    <br />
                <p>Once again Pedro, I am in general agreement with your observations.
                    <br />
                <p>However, what you ask here is not merely for a simple definition of
                    <br />
                    information but the entire context in which such a notion can be founded.
                    <br />
                    Other definitions / notions are needed. You must define what it is to
                    <br />
                    &quot;know&quot; - what meaning and prediction are, for example.
                    <br />
                <p>I have explored this question somewhat - so let me put it out there as a
                    <br />
                    &quot;straw man.&quot; This model takes my previous assertions regarding experience
                    <br />
                    as its premise.
                    <br />
                <p>In my model all metaphysics is the embodied content of experience.
                    <br />
                <p>Meaning is the embodied trace of experience - the physiological structure
                    <br />
                    that characterizes a product of semeiosis. Here is the cellular level
                    <br />
                    requirement - as yet determined, but let us point to neuroplasticity as a
                    <br />
                    possible example. Penrose might point to Orchestrated Objective Reduction as
                    <br />
                    another possible example - whatever, it doesn't matter at this point except
                    <br />
                    to observe that the model's architecture, when detailed, allows the
                    <br />
                    prediction of the engineering of that physiological structure.
                    <br />
                <p>Knowledge is the determinant of action. That is, it is revealed in action,
                    <br />
                    in sentient entities it is the product of semeiosis over the embodied
                    <br />
                    meaning set. We know how to walk by our innate embodiment of meaning - the
                    <br />
                    product of our genetics. We know how to prove the Pythagoras theorem by
                    <br />
                    acquired embodied meaning. We know how to communicate by speech because we
                    <br />
                    share a common acquired embodied convention (imperfectly).
                    <br />
                <p>Books, paintings, music are all marks - the subjects of signs. Signs are
                    <br />
                    the embodied experience of marks. The sun rise, the wind blowing, flower in
                    <br />
                    the field, are all marks. Marks are either natural marks - the product of
                    <br />
                    physical laws - or they are metaphysical marks - the product of intent.
                    <br />
                    Intent is the meaning embodied by the creator of a metaphysical mark in its
                    <br />
                    creation.
                    <br />
                <p>Semeiosis is the ongoing experience of signs - both those embodied as the
                    <br />
                    traces of experience from past semeiosis and those that are the immediate
                    <br />
                    product of senses.
                    <br />
                <p>So, finally, what is information? Information is that which informs - by
                    <br />
                    which we mean it identifies cause and adds to knowledge (see above
                    <br />
                    definition).
                    <br />
                <p>In my model I generalize the notion of knowledge so that I can apply the
                    <br />
                    notion over inanimate/non-sentient cases - I know that this generalization
                    <br />
                    makes people uncomfortable, as it does me on occasion, but it is by this
                    <br />
                    generalization that I can essentially define information simply as
                    <br />
                    &quot;difference&quot; in all cases and I can argue that a particle &quot;knows&quot; what
                    <br />
                    action to take as the product of information input. This leads inevitably
                    <br />
                    to my notion of &quot;perfect action&quot; ... but that will side track us here.
                    <br />
                <p>For completeness I should also mention my prediction model. Abduction is
                    <br />
                    the foundation of all prediction - it is the unfettered intuition.
                    <br />
                    Induction is the constraint of abduction by prior reductive experience - we
                    <br />
                    learn induction by taking apart the world and putting it back together.
                    <br />
                    Deduction is the constraint of induction by formal conventions (such as
                    <br />
                    mathematical logic) that we use in analysis and communication.
                    <br />
                <p>I hope this helps the discussion - I think I covered all Pedro's points.
                    <br />
                <p>With respect,
                    <br />
                    Steven
