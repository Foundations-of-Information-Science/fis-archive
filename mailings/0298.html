Dear colleagues
<br />
<p>Let me inform you how the manifestation of the Homage to Karl Ludwig von
<br />
Bertalanffy during the 100th Anniversary of his Birthday.  has been
<br />
planned, until September 2000
<br />
,
<br />
Being born in Vienna in 1901 (September 19th), LvB became
<br />
<p>&quot;...one of those strategically placed thinkers whose knowledge in many
<br />
fields permits them...to penetrate to the quick of the living reality.&quot;
<br />
[Aldous Huxley].
<br />
<p>He advocated that we dare to broaden our loyalty from nation to globe and
<br />
urged that we become patriots of the planet, endeavoring to think and act
<br />
primarily as members of humanity, (and) begin pledging our allegiance to
<br />
humanity and to the earth on which we stand, one planet indivisible or not
<br />
planet at all. &quot;We must begin protecting the individual and cultural
<br />
identity of others&quot;. He advocated as well a new global morality: &quot;an ethos
<br />
which does not center on individual good and individual value alone, but on
<br />
the adaptation of mankind, as a global system, to its new environment&quot;. &quot;We
<br />
are dealing with emergent realities; no longer with isolated groups of men,
<br />
but with a systematically interdependent global community. It is this level
<br />
of [reality] which we must keep before our eyes if we are able to inspire
<br />
large-scale action designed to assure our collective and hence our
<br />
individual survival.&quot; He argued: &quot;Possibly the model of the world as a
<br />
great organization can help to reinforce the sense of reverence for the
<br />
living which we have almost lost in the last sanguinary decades of human
<br />
history&quot;.
<br />
<p>&quot; [Uncommon Sense. The Life &amp; Thought of Bertalanffy. Mark Davidson]
<br />
<p>Last 19th September 2000 there was a Preliminary Meeting (sponsored by the
<br />
University of Technology of Vienna) in order to examine how to organize
<br />
from 19 September 2000 to 19 September 2001 (The Bertalanffy Year for some
<br />
members of the Systems Community) the 100th Anniversary of his Birthday
<br />
<p>In this Meeting the participants agree not only to celebrate his birthday
<br />
but to examine how the Systems Thinking that has been evolving during the
<br />
last three decades, since Bertalanffy produced a General Systems Theory,
<br />
have contributed to solve the urgent problems of humankind.
<br />
<p>This celebration comprises two phases:
<br />
<p>A CONVERSAZIONE based on exchange of views, through e-mail (*), about
<br />
Bertalanffian thoughts and their development at present
<br />
<p>A CONFERENCE that will be held November 1 - 4, 2001 in Vienna as a Forum
<br />
for presentation of papers, lectures, speeches, posters and also an Open
<br />
Space for self-organized debates and discussions
<br />
<p>Best wishes
<br />
