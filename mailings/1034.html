<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Thank you very much to Shu Kun for his interesting papers. I’ll try 
<br />
to understand it deeply and to apply it in my researches. If I have a 
<br />
success in this way, I’ll be glad to inform Shu Kun and all of you.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Concerning to the theme of information from genetic molecules, 
<br />
proposed by Pedro for our dicussion, I would like to say the following. It’s 
<br />
well known, that kinds of biological organisms are very different from each 
<br />
other from many viewpoints. For example, they have different morphology of 
<br />
their bodies, different types of locomotion (some of organisms can walk, 
<br />
others can swim, others can fly, others can creep, etc), different types of 
<br />
reproduction systems, etc. Against this background of differences among 
<br />
organisms, molecular genetics has discovered in the past century a striking 
<br />
fact that just from the information-hereditary viewpoint all biological 
<br />
organisms are unified wonderfully: all of them have identical bases of 
<br />
system of genetic coding - from bacteria up to a whale and from worm up to a 
<br />
bird and man. In other words, a great union of biological organisms has been 
<br />
happened in science. From this moment the information viewpoint on 
<br />
biological objects became more and more fundamental and interesting for many 
<br />
scientists year by year.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the information viewpoint, biological organisms are information 
</em><br />
essences. They live due to receiving of the genetic information from the 
<br />
ancestors, and they exist to transfer the genetic information to their 
<br />
descendants. All physical, chemical, cybernetic and others mechanisms can be 
<br />
considered in the frame of this viewpoint as secondary supporting equipments 
<br />
to provide this main biological task of stable bio-information flow. In the 
<br />
biological literature it is possible quite often to meet the statement now 
<br />
that biological organisms are the texts since a molecular level of their 
<br />
organization.
<br />
It’s very probable that no one from physiological systems can survive in 
<br />
biological evolution without structural agreement with structure of genetic 
<br />
code because of a simple reason that such physiological system can’t be 
<br />
transmitted to descendants. Darwin’s theory of natural selection has paid a 
<br />
main attention to importance of factors of external surroundings for natural 
<br />
selection of organisms. In my opinion, facts of molecular 
<br />
genetic-information union of biological organisms put forward a new problem 
<br />
of natural selection: a problem of natural selection of physiological 
<br />
systems according to internal (for each kind of organisms) factors of their 
<br />
structural agreement with basic structure of genetic coding. One can suppose 
<br />
that all physiological systems and processes, including of world perception 
<br />
and of theoretical and cultural activities of people, have such stamp of 
<br />
their agreement with basic genetic structures. This is a reason of special 
<br />
importance of a problem of information genetic molecules for science in a 
<br />
whole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own researches of genetic code I have discovered that so named 
<br />
“elementary” alphabet of genetic code isn’t elementary but consists of three 
<br />
binary sub-alphabets due to objective biochemical attributes of its 
<br />
elements. This circumstances lead to many essential consequences. My first 
<br />
publication in English on these results is presented at FIS site 
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/recources/papers.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/recources/papers.html</a>  in my article “Genetic 
<br />
Code and the Ancient Chinese “Book of Changes””. This publication is based 
<br />
at my book: S.V.Petoukhov “Biperiodic Table of Genetic Code and Number of 
<br />
Protons”, Moscow, 2001, 258 p. (in Russian; information on this book, on its 
<br />
content, etc. in English is at site 
<br />
<a href="../../members.tripod.com/vismath/sg/petoukhov.htm">http://members.tripod.com/vismath/sg/petoukhov.htm</a> ). I prolong these 
<br />
researches now intensively. A few of them is presenting in these days in my 
<br />
report “The Biperiodic Table and Attributive Conception of Genetic Code. A 
<br />
Problem of Unification Bases of Biological Languages” at “The 2003 
<br />
International Conference on Mathematics and Engineering Techniques in 
<br />
Medicine and Biological Sciences” (session “Bioinformatics 2003”, June 
<br />
23-26, 2003, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA). The paper should be published in the 
<br />
Proceedings and CD-ROMs of the Conference.
<br />
My results have permitted to introduce binary numbers and binary sequences 
<br />
in bioinformatics in analogical manner with binary sequences of computer 
<br />
informatics. Thank you very much to Jerry for his last information for 
<br />
FISers about the Symposium &quot;Digital Biology: The Emerging Paradigm&quot; 
<br />
(November 6-7, 2003). This title is very close to my results in genetic 
<br />
coding and to my modern attempts to understand biological organisms. New 
<br />
paradigm of digital biology seems to be very perspective. Of course, it 
<br />
doesn’t close many other ways to investigate biological organisms from 
<br />
alternative initial viewpoints.
<br />
Thank you very much to all FIZers who participate in our Internet’s 
<br />
scientific discussions. Specially thanks to organizers of these discussions. 
<br />
As to me, I read all FIZErs letters attentively and get valuable information 
<br />
and inspiration from them. Unfortunately I have no possibility to 
<br />
participate in all FIS-actions as active as I want.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergei
