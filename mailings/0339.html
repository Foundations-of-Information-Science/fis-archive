<p>
I am sorry that in my previous message I forgot to add the names of those
<br />
who signed the Merida Manifesto.
<br />
<p>The undersigned, university professors from different Latin American
<br />
countries and participants in the First Latin American Colloquium on
<br />
Interpretive Systemology carried out in Mérida Venezuela (1-4 October,
<br />
2001), consider of  primal importance to let know systems thinkers in
<br />
particular and the public in general, the following reflections on the
<br />
current world crisis.
<br />
<p>Jorge Dávila (Venezuela), José Daniel Cabrera (Colombia), Ramsés Fuenmayor
<br />
(Venezuela), Lilia Gélvez (Colombia), Eduardo Ibarra (México), Jorge
<br />
Ishizawa (Perú), Bruno Jerardino (Chile), Edmundo Leiva (Chile), Hernán
<br />
López Garay (Venezuela), Hugo Marroquín (Perú), Alejandro Ochoa
<br />
(Venezuela), María Teresa Santander (Chile), Ricardo Sotaquirá (Colombia),
<br />
Roldan T. Suárez (Venezuela), Miriam Villarreal (Venezuela);.professors
<br />
from different Latin American universities and speakers in the  Primer
<br />
Coloquio Latinoamericano en Sistemología Interpretativa.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Mérida,  octubre de 2001
<br />
<p>In the last four days, participants in the Colloquium have presented their
<br />
research projects on and debated about a number of Latin American
<br />
organizational and institutional  problems related to: education, justice,
<br />
social welfare, community organizations, poverty, technology and society,
<br />
cultural diversity in peasant communities, managerial technologies and
<br />
organizational phenomena.
<br />
<p>Beyond the obvious underlying and connecting theme -the systems approach as
<br />
applied to institutional problems-another theme emerged that gathered our
<br />
thought and reflections in this Colloquium. It has become clear at the end
<br />
of our meetings that  a crucial problem unfolded by our research is the
<br />
growing devastation brought about by several anti-cultural forms that high
<br />
modernity (or postmodernity) has made possible.
<br />
<p>These anti-cultural forms -which are present in such areas as the
<br />
ontological ground of technology, the media, the lack of an authentic
<br />
education, organizational phenomena, neo-liberalism, and in  the strong
<br />
sway that the market and the instrumental rationality of our time holds
<br />
over our lives- pose a serious threat to the basic cultural practices
<br />
(proper of a culture in &quot;good condition&quot;) of nursing, raising and caring.
<br />
<p>The violent devastation of cultural soils that we are experiencing in the
<br />
present, as the result of  the widespread of these anti-cultural forms, is
<br />
leading to a meaningless world; a world under the serious threat of various
<br />
forms of nihilism and violence; a world subjected to a deep and growing
<br />
process of desolation.
<br />
<p>A clear manifestation of this process is the response given by the
<br />
governments of  so called &quot;developed world&quot;, led by the United States, to
<br />
the tragic events that took place in New York and Washington  last
<br />
September 11.
<br />
<p>In this context, and bearing in mind the anti-cultural phenomena previously
<br />
mentioned, the undersigned systems thinkers want to make public the
<br />
following manifesto:
<br />
<p>THE MERIDA MANIFESTO
<br />
<p>1. We add our name to the large list of peoples that  condemn the terrorist
<br />
attack   which regrettably took the lives of thousands of human beings last
<br />
September 11. It is a defining feature of our humanity to be able to
<br />
empathize with other fellow humans (i.e. to have the ability to put oneself
<br />
in the position of other human being)  and thus experience something close
<br />
to the grief and sorrow they may be undergoing in the United States.
<br />
Nonetheless, we must also add our name to  two other lists. These, unlike
<br />
the first are, perhaps, much shorter.
<br />
<p>2. We join the short list of those who clearly and strongly condemn the
<br />
international behaviour of the United States government and other
<br />
imperialist  states in the last century and the beginnings of the twenty
<br />
first. As a matter of fact, such unjustified behaviour has been, directly
<br />
or indirectly, the cause of the death of millions of children and innocent
<br />
people in general. We do not have to go too far in this history of State
<br />
violence to see  its real proportions. Just recall the criminal behaviour
<br />
of the United States government at the end of the Second World War when the
<br />
murder of hundreds of thousands of people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima was
<br />
perpetrated. Examples of similar behaviour in Latin America abound. We
<br />
recall for instance the death of more than seven thousand people in Panamá
<br />
as a result of  the illegal military invasion carried out by the USA army
<br />
to capture General Noriega, a man that had previously worked very closely
<br />
with the CIA. Let us recall also the  bloody dictatorships  set up  by the
<br />
USA government  in Chile and Argentina during the seventies and eighties.
<br />
<p>Another example of the criminal foreign policy of USA is the long embargo
<br />
this government has led against Iraq and which has resulted in the death of
<br />
more than five hundred thousand  Iraqi    children. These examples are but
<br />
a few of the many outrages and great injustices perpetrated by  the USA
<br />
government around the world, the proof of which are nowadays even provided
<br />
by the CIA itself!  It is clear then, that such a State violence -which is
<br />
conducted with the active involvement of other governments such as Britain-
<br />
is breeding  violence all over the world. This is not to say that we
<br />
justify in any way the violent events that took place in New York and
<br />
Washington last September 11. However, we  equally disapprove  the violent
<br />
and murderous response of the USA government against the people of
<br />
Afghanistan (regretfully with the support of the majority of  world
<br />
governments). Therefore, we must add our name to a third list.
<br />
<p>3. This list  is formed by those  people who reject and condemn  the brutal
<br />
retaliation carried out by the USA government         -joined in this
<br />
irrational and inhuman task by its allies- as a response to the
<br />
aforementioned events of September 11. It is brutal because it rallies a
<br />
coalition of  the most powerful armies of the world to bombard Afghanistan,
<br />
one of the poorest, most ravaged war-torn nations of the earth. Millions of
<br />
Afghans  are fleeing their country at this very moment, seeking refuge and
<br />
starving in the process. The response is brutal also because as one can see
<br />
from declarations of the White House and other government officials,   they
<br />
reveal a flagrant contradiction  of the most cherished principles and
<br />
ideals which constitute the legitimating foundation of the power of a
<br />
modern democratic State, as the governments of the  USA and their allies
<br />
are supposed to represent. These ideals are none other than those of
<br />
justice, democracy and freedom!
<br />
<p>According to those principles, these governments led by the USA should seek
<br />
and bring to justice, to a fair trial in an international court of justice,
<br />
those who committed  the murderous  attacks of September 11.  However, in
<br />
order to accomplish this task, they ought not launch a war to massacre
<br />
innocent people, as they are doing it right now,  and  risk the lives of
<br />
millions more (including those of their  own people) who inevitably will be
<br />
dragged into this war.
<br />
<p>We must also  denounce the unfair and quite disproportionate significance
<br />
given to the terrorist attack of September 11 by comparison with many other
<br />
terrorist acts carried out around the world -many of them performed by the
<br />
US government. Let us imagine this attack had been launched against
<br />
Bolivia, Nicaragua or Iraq rather than to the USA. It is not hard to see
<br />
that the response of the developed nations and  their friends would have
<br />
been completely different. Another example of such unfairness is the fact
<br />
that  on September 11, the very same day of the terrorist attack -and
<br />
something similar can be said of any other day- according to statistics
<br />
offered by international organizations, thousands of children died of
<br />
starvation in so called underdeveloped countries, in some cases as the
<br />
direct result of economic policies enforced by the USA government through
<br />
the IMF and the World Bank.
<br />
<p>Should not we regret with equal sorrow the unjustified dead of these human
<br />
beings? Yet there were neither special 24 hour editions of CNN for several
<br />
days lamenting this tragedy nor marches in several cities showing their
<br />
solidarity with the  families of the victims, much less a minute of silence
<br />
in Wall Street for them. How come? Why the billions of dollars being spent
<br />
in the bloody revenge of the USA government against Afghanistan and other
<br />
countries are not destined to feed and take care of   millions of starving
<br />
children in this world? Is it not here, in such a great unbalances,  the
<br />
key to find a peaceful solution to world terrorism?
<br />
<p>We hope these reflections will make  clear why we add our names to three
<br />
lists which most people would consider incompatible. Their common thread is
<br />
their underlying notion of justice and the perhaps more and more uncommon
<br />
ability nowadays to empathize with the grief and suffering of other human
<br />
beings, regardless of  whether they are US citizens, Colombians or Chinese,
<br />
or whether they are Christians, Muslims, Buddhists or simply atheists.
