<p>
During the last twentieth century some of the advances attained by 
<br />
social dissidents who managed to lead successfully certain local and 
<br />
national movements for the public recognition of women's, workers', 
<br />
students, peasants,&#x160; rights comprised those of some minorities and 
<br />
the prohibition and even suppression of social and ethnical 
<br />
segregation have become new possibilities for pushing ahead 
<br />
consciously the development of humankind. An increasing number of 
<br />
politicians, based on the information = knowledge available about the 
<br />
changes accomplished but also about other needs and even necessarily 
<br />
fair prerogatives, have organized their performance continuously 
<br />
arguing that they will improve whatever might be necessary for 
<br />
improving the way of life of the people involved, in case they were 
<br />
elected for playing a significant role in every  new government.
<br />
<p>So far most people comprised the politicians everywhere believe de 
<br />
facto that the progress of humankind is real because it is based on 
<br />
the undeniable advancement of scientific work in every discipline 
<br />
constituted, also because the number and features of many 
<br />
technological and methodological innovations continuously increases 
<br />
and because many more people is receiving a basic education every 
<br />
year. It is even argued that the explosive proliferation of human 
<br />
beings during the last twentieth is the best evidence of the progress 
<br />
of humankind
<br />
<p>Nine years ago, Stafford Beer as President of the World Organization 
<br />
of Systems and Cybernetics in the its Congress that took place in New 
<br />
Delhi described briefly [Beer, 1993] what he thought were the 
<br />
components of contemporary change, at the end of the 20th century, 
<br />
were.   &quot;At the top is the spectacular advance in human misery.   I 
<br />
estimate that more human beings are enduring agony today than ever 
<br />
before; the number could be greater than the sum of sufferers 
<br />
throughout history.   I speak of starvation and epidemic; war and 
<br />
terrorism; deprivation, exploitation, and physical torture&quot; - and, 
<br />
after stressing once more the word &quot;agony&quot;, he considered it 
<br />
necessary to remark that he was not talking about &quot;hard times&quot;.
<br />
<p>Second in his list was: &quot;...the collapse of the civilization we have 
<br />
known in our lifetime.   We are looking at the rubble that remains of 
<br />
two competing empires. Soviet communism has accepted its own demise; 
<br />
Western capitalism has not accepted it yet&quot;   Anyhow he asserted: &quot;I 
<br />
am not making a forecast but examining the facts that are under our 
<br />
noses&quot;.
<br />
<p>Furthermore, he said: &quot;...no-one talks about the exploitation of 
<br />
either nature or indigenous peoples any more.   They talk instead 
<br />
about 'sustainable development' - but there is no such thing.&quot;   And 
<br />
for the sake of argument he said: &quot;Not only can development not be 
<br />
sustained; even the existing fabric cannot be sustained any longer.&quot; 
<br />
&quot;These two spectacular transitions, of human agony and societary 
<br />
collapse are connected&quot; and &quot;we are governed by an oligarchy - of 
<br />
power, greed and terror&quot; but &quot;In the most extraordinary way, we are 
<br />
blind to this&quot;.   Apart from criticizing the presence in the human 
<br />
world of powerful modern armaments which amplify and aggravate all 
<br />
kinds of problems everywhere, he went on to ask: &quot;What are we to say 
<br />
about the management that procreates this disastrous mess?&quot; then he 
<br />
answered himself: &quot;Without jumping to conspiracy theories, or citing 
<br />
the illegal activities which now constitute the world's biggest 
<br />
industry, we can at the least say that humankind now manages its own 
<br />
affairs with breathtaking incompetence.&quot;
<br />
<p>This judgement was evidently derived from information available of 
<br />
real facts and actions that  have been the outcome of intelligent 
<br />
reasoning exerted by decision makers who are continuously improving 
<br />
their knowledge based on genuine, false or distorted and incomplete 
<br />
information
