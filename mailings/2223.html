<p>
Jerry and Kevin-
<br />
<p>This promises to be a terrific session! Already I 
<br />
am using my second message for the week.
<br />
<p>May I suggest that there is a difference between 
<br />
considering molecular information flows as a 
<br />
chemist or biologist and doing so in the FIS 
<br />
context?
<br />
<p>In the local context, all you have to do is 
<br />
invent a new science that sheds new light on 
<br />
phenomenon that are seen locally, namely in the 
<br />
molecular domain. In the FIS context, you have 
<br />
this seeming impossibility squared. That's 
<br />
because you'll be using this domain to get 
<br />
leverage on the larger problem of an information 
<br />
science that applies at all domains. And more 
<br />
importantly, we'd understand what flows among 
<br />
domains and how.
<br />
<p>Toward this end, I'd like to put an early 
<br />
suggestion for limiting the &quot;bio&quot; semiotic 
<br />
approach a bit. Several smart people here have 
<br />
noted the internal/external problem of meaning 
<br />
and intent when you scale biosemiotics down to 
<br />
elements that apparently cannot reason. So I am 
<br />
very skeptical of Peircian mechanics at the 
<br />
biological level.
<br />
<p>And yet - as with many - I find I cannot abandon 
<br />
the notion of meaning when using that of 
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>So I would ask you (Jerry and Kevin) if we cannot 
<br />
have a limited semiosis. In the following way:
<br />
<p>Generally, we like to think of things that have 
<br />
physical reality as the causal primitives in 
<br />
science. So we think of entities having 
<br />
properties as a first order concern, and those 
<br />
entities are the ones we can see and measure. So 
<br />
even though all our rudimentary physics actually 
<br />
operates by way of fields, we suppose those 
<br />
fields as assigned to or generated by entities. 
<br />
We go so far as to require other entities to be 
<br />
exchanged in field effects.
<br />
<p>And I see this with chemists as well. The 
<br />
assumption is that the molecule is what exists as 
<br />
the primitive agent. If information is exchanged, 
<br />
it must be among these &quot;hard&quot; entities. So we 
<br />
look, for instance at their shape (which I know 
<br />
Jerry will get to), and the structural elements 
<br />
Pedro mentions below.
<br />
<p>Can we posit that the true identity of a molecule 
<br />
is something information-based and that what we 
<br />
see is the text, a text, a representation and not 
<br />
something that some god started his day with? 
<br />
This allows me to swallow the important elements 
<br />
of biosemiotics, and forces me in the direction 
<br />
of inventing new abstractions for the primitives 
<br />
involved.
<br />
<p>And of course, these would be abstractions behind 
<br />
the &quot;text&quot; we see, and the one molecules 
<br />
perceive. Fields and particles then become 
<br />
effects, not something necessarily intrinsic to 
<br />
information flows and bindings.
<br />
<p>So then, brief responses to Jerry, Kevin, Pedro...
<br />
<p>Jerry:
<br />
<p>I am glad you gave us the history. But I think 
<br />
history is the enemy here. The abstractions we 
<br />
blindly accept today were invented in a duller 
<br />
context and to satisfy needs vastly less 
<br />
demanding than FIS requires. I fear too many 
<br />
contributors (one would be too many) will try to 
<br />
stretch one or another old principle to fit this 
<br />
new concern.
<br />
<p>But it is of extreme value in posing a candidate 
<br />
problem. After all, if we are creating something 
<br />
useful, it should solve problems more elegantly 
<br />
than before or describe more crisply or provide 
<br />
for better analytical tools.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What are the relations between this sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encoding and other metabolic encoding?  In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular, can we imagine a catalytic &#x2013; type of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encoding that parallels the genetic encoding?
</em><br />
<p>And here we have it. Thanks Jerry.
<br />
<p>Kevin:
<br />
<p>I am so glad I heard your talk in Paris. So I 
<br />
know that when you say &quot;Computer Science,&quot; you 
<br />
mean something larger than the ability to 
<br />
describe things algorithmically. But this notion 
<br />
of &quot;natural computation&quot; implies the logics 
<br />
involved are confined to the relatively simpler 
<br />
logics we normally code for/model within. The 
<br />
first order and probabilistic logics. I think 
<br />
that an unnecessary limitation.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The simulation relation is central in automata 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory and was recast into a category-theoretic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;framework by Arbib and Goguen (taking different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approaches).   But the notion of a mapping 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between a biological system and a formal system, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to be, at first glance, a category 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mistake!  As soon as one identifies a fragment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of nature as a system, one has locked in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set of states, and it is hard to separate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true computational power of a living system from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what accrues merely to our conventional state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assignment. This is taken up nicely by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosopher David Chalmers in a response to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very strong statement at the conventionality end 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by Hilary Putnam. (One could see this as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recasting of the debate in Plato's Cratylus in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational terms!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This tension between the formal and the material 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to lie at the heart of the field of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;natural computing.
</em><br />
<p>So we need to reinvent both, yes? Both our formal 
<br />
mechanics of computation and our notions of what 
<br />
the &quot;material&quot; is. In both cases we are dealing 
<br />
with abstraction science and unavoidably category 
<br />
theory, no?
<br />
<p>Pedro:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This point is so important! Let me refer to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arguments in my presentations ECAP 2005, and FIS 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2005. I argued that as a consequence of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;peculiar &quot;embodiment&quot; of the biomolecular agents 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(enzymes), in the study of their function we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to pay attention not only to the strictly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;functional &#x2018;what&#x2019; dictated in the active site of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the enzyme, but also to a series of accompanying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes distributed over different parts of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the molecular structure, which may include: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modulation by effectors, intracellular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transportation, permanent (post-translational) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modification, formation of complexes, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time-frames derived from transcription and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;translation, and finally degradation. So the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&#x2018;what&#x2019; of the functional clause should be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accompanied by circumstances such as &#x2018;how fast&#x2019;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&#x2018;where&#x2019;, &#x2018;which way&#x2019;, &#x2018;with whom&#x2019;, &#x2018;when&#x2019;, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&#x2018;how long&#x2019;. The mind-boggling factor is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;almost all of these circumstances may be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;captured within particular parts --MODULES, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;DOMAINS-- of the enzyme, corresponding to DNA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exons &amp; introns, and then become amenable to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolutionary control... this is basically the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;source of eukaryotic organismic complexity: a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;genetic algorithm&quot; decomposable in parallel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;logical&quot; clauses that can be explored and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solved in independent steps.
</em><br />
<p>As always, I'm with you, but suspect you fear 
<br />
going to far so don't go far enough. Why not?
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
