Dear Andrei,
<br />
Once again thank you for your moderation of our discussion 
<br />
and for your patience. I would not like to try your patience 
<br />
more, but I have some questions. 
<br />
<p>It looks like the discussion has become focused on the 
<br />
controversy between the realistic and operational 
<br />
interpretations of quantum mechanics QM. However, the issues 
<br />
of interpretation of various scientific theories are much 
<br />
older. We can ask similar questions whether classical 
<br />
mechanics (CM) describes some transcendent reality, or it is 
<br />
our mind's tool to comprehend this reality (Kant). Or, the 
<br />
question about the status of geometry.
<br />
We can ask about the status of relativity (not only of 
<br />
Einstein's relativity, but Galilean too). Each time we can 
<br />
be puzzled by the inconsistencies with our intuition. 
<br />
<p>I could find in the present discussion quite frequent 
<br />
statements about individual beliefs (&quot;I accept ... 
<br />
interpretation&quot; or &quot;I am going beyond Copenhagen 
<br />
interpretation...&quot;) or about group preferences (&quot;Copenhagen 
<br />
interpretation is a common view of physicists...&quot; or &quot;At 
<br />
this or that conference there was a common agreement...&quot;
<br />
The discussion of beliefs is a questionable business. For me 
<br />
most important is what are the arguments for or against 
<br />
given preferences, not who, or how many people believe in 
<br />
something. I know that those whose philosophical ground is 
<br />
in some form of pragmatism (e.g. early American pragmatism) 
<br />
would consider consensus of beliefs of &quot;scientific 
<br />
community&quot; as a criterion of truth, but it is as good 
<br />
philosophical view as any other, and many people do not 
<br />
subscribe to it.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I think we should separate several aspects of the QM 
<br />
interpretation: 
<br />
a) What do we want to interpret (exactly what formalism?),
<br />
b) What are our philosophical positions? 
<br />
c) What is common in different approaches?
<br />
d) What is different in different approaches?  
<br />
<p>Remembering about these questions and the possible answers, 
<br />
we can try to clarify the situation. 
<br />
<p>What definitely counts as &quot;common&quot; is that the current 
<br />
formalisms of QM are different from the formalisms of CM. 
<br />
This brings the following question. 
<br />
Are the differences between formalisms:
<br />
- reflections of the differences in the domains of the 
<br />
application (different physical realities, or different 
<br />
components of the reality requiring different intellectual 
<br />
tools), 
<br />
- differences in the tools, but the reality itself is 
<br />
uniform  (hidden variables for classical form of uniformity, 
<br />
classical mechanics as approximation of the one purely 
<br />
quantum reality), or 
<br />
- there is no reality at all (or we cannot know it at all), 
<br />
and the differences are in ourselves, in the ways how we 
<br />
create our subjective views of the apparent reality. 
<br />
<p>I do not see how these differences influence our objective 
<br />
to discuss quantum information? Am I missing something?
<br />
<p>I understand (especially after your reports) that the new 
<br />
developments question the role of experimental results 
<br />
attemting to settle the issue of impossibility of hidden 
<br />
variables through Bell's inequalities. 
<br />
Well, too bad. But is it so dramatic situation? It does not 
<br />
mean that somebody has proved something. We just know less 
<br />
than we thought we knew. It does not compell anybody to 
<br />
switch from one of the positions above to another. 
<br />
<p>But, how all that is influencing our subject of quantum 
<br />
information? Could you please present your view?
<br />
<p>You wrote (if I understand you correctly) that you cannot 
<br />
accept the subjective interoretation of QM or of probability 
<br />
(or both), because you need independent reality to consider 
<br />
information. I do not say that I oppose it, but I do not see 
<br />
how the argument works. Somebody could make just an opposite 
<br />
statement, QM or probability should be interpreted in 
<br />
subjective terms, as they are related to information, and 
<br />
information is a subjective concept. (It is not my view, so 
<br />
please do not ask me to defend it. But, it is a possible 
<br />
argument.)
<br />
<p>And finally, one general question. Where are we in the 
<br />
discussion of QI? What questions did we answer? What new 
<br />
questions did we formulate? What questions do we want to 
<br />
answer?  
<br />
Regards,
<br />
Marcin
