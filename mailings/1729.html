Dear Malcolm and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Sorry for going backwards in the discussion (I have moved in to a new 
<br />
institute in this univ., see my new address at the bottom). After two 
<br />
weeks, I have this response pending:
<br />
<p>At 18:09 18/10/2004, Malcolm wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, you don't think that the use of common tools, such as logic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statistics, etc., or even common concepts (such as Aleks's example of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intereactive information) are enough to forge a genuine inter-disciplinary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consilience? In what way would a *genuine* informational approach be different?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>Those common tools do not help to connect --but very superficially-- the 
<br />
different disciplines involved in the analysis of any moderately complex 
<br />
phenomenon. We do not have  'logical cues' intradisciplinary situated 
<br />
informing the practitioner that his/her favorite discipline becomes 
<br />
irrelevant to understand the phenomenon, and that a new perspective has to 
<br />
enter. Like medieval rhetors we have to &quot;weigh&quot; the heterogeneous 
<br />
conceptual paths and compose an ad hoc disciplinary mix. I dare to call 
<br />
&quot;informational&quot; to this artistic blending or switching between separate 
<br />
knowledges because this type of compositional work is archetypal in other 
<br />
info &quot;model systems&quot; too (fis old story), such as in cellular signaling 
<br />
systems' pathways, and in nervous systems' separate sensory modalities. 
<br />
Switching to a new discipline and/or creating a new interdisciplinary field 
<br />
is like our own attentional switching: we continuously change the focus and 
<br />
put a new modality or a new sensory patch into the job of scanning little 
<br />
bits of the world.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is a distinction made in philosophy of science between the internal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dynamics of science, which excludes socio-psychological factors, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external dynamics, which looks only at the social dynamics of scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communities.  This seems to be similar to the distinction that Pedro is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;making.  If so, his claim is that interdisciplinary consilience cannot be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;captured within the internalist's way of viewing science (that is, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terms of the bare relationship between theories and their evidence).  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have some questions about this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that anyone who studies science has to make some kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;idealization or abstraction--science is too complex to understand in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;total. Some simplifications have to be made when studying any complex 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenon. Clearly that does not imply that the particular idealizations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;made by the internalists or the externalists are the right ones, or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best ones, to make for the purpose of understanding some particular aspect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of science, such as interdisciplinary consilience.  So, I am very open to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro's line of thought.  On the other hand, there has to some kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simplification made.  How should this be done?
</em><br />
<p>I do not have a good response yet. My personal contention is that the 
<br />
simplest 'info society', the living cell, has not received a sound info 
<br />
analysis yet. Why the bionformaticians community, basically committed to 
<br />
reductionist views, is making all that fuss on &quot;systems biology&quot; (and not 
<br />
only them: eg, some biosemioticians too)? An intriguing piece of new 
<br />
knowledge is needed.
<br />
<p>Concretely about the internal/external views of science, it might be that 
<br />
what we need is the &quot;externalist&quot; of the internal, and the &quot;internalist&quot; of 
<br />
the external. I mean, we can only build a social accumulation of knowledge 
<br />
(of associative learning) by relying on the most crude and elementary, and 
<br />
abstract elements within the action/perception cycle (eg, counting). And 
<br />
viceversa, we universalize and objectivize upon that knowledge by socially 
<br />
networking the limited, individual pieces produced... (references, 
<br />
professional commmunities, etc.)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a partial answer to my question: A general understanding of how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;macroscopic order arises out of simple interactive micro-systems may point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the way towards a better understanding of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An example that I know more about arises in physics, where it is difficult 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to explain why matter organizes itself into liquid, gas and solid phases 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when interacting molecules &quot;know&quot; nothing about the macroscopic order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which they are a part.  This phenomenon is hard to explain because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;critical phenomena (occurring during phase transitions) depend on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correlations that act at all distances at the same time.  That is, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usual idealization that density fluctuations are limited to micro-scales 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not work.  Rather, the fluctuations occur at all length scales (hence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the self-similarity of critical phenomena).  The mathematical techniques 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applied to this problem (scaling, intermediate asymptotics, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;renormalization methods borrowed from quantum field theory) are still not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very well understood from a mathematical point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, I still don't see exactly how this connects with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interdisciplinary consilience in Pedro's sense.  This may be because I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not sure exactly what interdisciplinary consilience amounts to on this view.
</em><br />
<p>I tend to disagree on that micro/macro view. Perhaps it happens with some 
<br />
cleanliness in phyiscial systems, that one can extensively track the 
<br />
physical information movements around (those ups and downs in Stan's 
<br />
scheme) notwithstanding phase transitions; but not in the biological realm. 
<br />
There one finds strange entities with info &quot;black hole&quot; properties: living 
<br />
cells advancing in their respective life cycles can disregard very robust 
<br />
info items on a facultative basis, and produce new items. And they do so 
<br />
monumentally independent of their whereabouts (up to some limits, of 
<br />
course). How the inner and the outer 'command flows' may systematically 
<br />
ignore each other, annihilate, reinforce, etc., (quite differently from the 
<br />
obedient average of the physical) is a great question: systems biology (and 
<br />
classical integrative physiology too), in need of a massive disciplinary 
<br />
switching becasue that black holing game is played massively..
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But why should it be considered seriously, exactly?  I don't (yet) see why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the internalist view of science has this limitation.  For it abstracts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;away of the distinction between individual scientists and a group of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientists, so it could easily include emergent features that arise from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the interactions between individuals.  If not, why not?
</em><br />
<p>&quot;Consilience&quot; is great because it conveys a bygone aspect of the sciences: 
<br />
their conciliation, their permanent session in &quot;concilium&quot; ... (lost into 
<br />
the hierarchy and reduction dusts, and merely left into the territory of 
<br />
pragmatics); and also because it evokes the global wisdom or 'consilience 
<br />
of closure' that we may legitimately demand to our social system of 
<br />
creation of knowledge: that it should contribute to the advancement of life.
<br />
<p>(that's all I can ramble around the questions!)
<br />
<p>best greetings
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. to Rafael --Borges is indeed a treasure-- I remember his &quot;Funes el 
<br />
memorioso&quot; too: isn't it a parable of the limitations of the observer? And 
<br />
to Jerry: can you connect your molecular algebra (syntax) to the protein 
<br />
folding problem? (I will try to read carefully all this recent stuff).
