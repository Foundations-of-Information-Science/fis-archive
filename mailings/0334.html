Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy was born 19 September 1901 (one hundred years ago)

<br />
<p>General Systems Weltanschauung, which is still a new way of thinking,
<br />
though it was suggested by L. von Bertalanffy since the 1960, is needed
<br />
because the trends of the prevailing civilization are making necessary to
<br />
see clearly the forest instead of looking only at one tree or another. It
<br />
seems certainly foolish to focus on individual trees when there is a threat
<br />
to the forest. However, it is also foolish to focus exclusively on the
<br />
forest when there are environmental problems generated by polluting
<br />
industries. But it remains foolish to improve only factories in order to
<br />
reduce pollution when the unemployment is growing due to economic policies
<br />
that intend only to reduced the foreign debt. Nowadays it has become absurd
<br />
to believe that it is possible to invent systems methodologies for allowing
<br />
6,000 million people to improve their way of life, without trying to
<br />
understand what are the causes of the serious biological, social and
<br />
terrestrial crisis that is affecting the homsphere, the biosphere and the
<br />
ecosphere.
<br />
<p>L. von Bertalanffy when calling for a universal declaration of
<br />
interdependence, more than three decades ago,  advocated a new global
<br />
morality: &quot;an ethos which does not center on individual good and individual
<br />
value alone, but on the adaptation of mankind as a global system, to its
<br />
new environment.&quot; The need for this new morality, he said, was imperative:
<br />
&quot;We are dealing with emergent realities; no longer with isolated groups of
<br />
men, but with a systematically interdependent global community. It is this
<br />
level of [reality] which we must keep before our eyes if we are able to
<br />
inspire large-scale action designed to assure our collective and hence our
<br />
individual survival&quot;.(*)
<br />
<p>The healthy, then moral evolvement of human relations, being necessary for
<br />
pushing ahead frankly and effectively the development of any particular
<br />
community, makes necessary to create, maintain and improve the kind of
<br />
cultural values that may help and lead people, children comprised, to
<br />
develop individually and collectively their gregarious and cooperative
<br />
features inherent in human nature which combined with sense of
<br />
responsibility and free decision would support altogether the manifestation
<br />
of humanitarian societies aware of the role of human beings on the planet
<br />
Earth.
<br />
<p>General Systems Weltanschauung is an ideological medium that may act as a
<br />
kind of catalytic agent, when searching how to organize an approach towards
<br />
a holistic intention, through trustworthy worldviews:
<br />
<p>1.	for supporting  researchers, scholars and experts - when they are
<br />
involved in decision making - in their learning to perform as responsible
<br />
scientists, therefore conscious enough of the need of maintaining Unity
<br />
through diversity of cultures
<br />
<p>2.	for allowing them to be sufficiently aware of humankind's needs and
<br />
also of terrestrial, biological and social possibilities and restrictions
<br />
<p>3.	for helping them to conceive the systems of ideas needed for
<br />
building reliable circumstances required for identifying one or another way
<br />
forward that may succour the 'civilized' humanity to determine rationally
<br />
and emotionally its planetary role
<br />
<p>The problems that faces humankind at the dawn of the 3rd milllennium,
<br />
include pollution by means of pesticides, chemicals, sewage and garbage;
<br />
deforestation causing the extinction of many species; climate changes due
<br />
to green house effects; depletion of non-renewable mineral reserves &amp;
<br />
energy reserves. Also the detrimental export of capital from less developed
<br />
nations to industrialized ones; export of inflation &amp; recession and unfair
<br />
trade that increase wastage &amp; underemployment of human potentiality.
<br />
<p>These problems are causing lately the emergence of social situations
<br />
'infected' with xenophobia, racism, religious &amp; ethnical intolerance, which
<br />
may generate terrorism in general and in particular the suicidal one, and
<br />
also are the causes of the growing criminality and the increasing number of
<br />
armed conflicts among tribes, ethnical groups, religious factions,...
<br />
However urgently necessary to deal with these social problems, in the
<br />
panorama  generated by GSW they appear only as symptoms of the worst crisis
<br />
ever faced by humankind, being it generated by the dynamics of the whole
<br />
civilization, which:
<br />
<p>*  has become the source of serious troubles in the homosphere, due to an
<br />
increasing number of inhuman actions that impide - biologically,
<br />
psychologically and intellectually - a decent survival of billions of
<br />
people;
<br />
<p>*  has evolved as the main cause that reduces the diversity in the
<br />
biosphere, due to an utilitarian and excessive exploitation of natural
<br />
resources for the sake of making monetary profits through all kinds of
<br />
unilateral business;
<br />
<p>*  has created the 'fabric' that engenders more and more waste which
<br />
increases the pollution of water, air, soils,... around the whole planet
<br />
and causes irreversible changes to the terrestrial atmosphere.
<br />
<p>The whole question is very serious because it is happening as a culmination
<br />
of intelligent actions, cleverly conceived, skilfully implemented and
<br />
consciously maintained and improved by rather few human beings -the so
<br />
called decision makers inside the constituted elites.
<br />
<p>Besides, being considered the crisis as an illness of humankind, it
<br />
aggravates because very often its symptoms are unfairly amplified and
<br />
exploited in order to deviate the attention of people towards a miraculous
<br />
'panacea' or a magical 'elixir' that presumably should eliminate the evils
<br />
of society or kill the infected humans that have become incurable. Such a
<br />
kind of procedures have been extensively used in every society because
<br />
those humans who succeed in distracting the attention of people usually get
<br />
not only a magnificent material recompense but also the access to the
<br />
entrance inside the elites' domain, if and only if they remain loyal to the
<br />
rules unexplicitly established. Consequently most of those humans who might
<br />
be motivated and be interested in searching the causes of the societal
<br />
illness and finding ways to cope with it, pretty  soon get involved in
<br />
something else, mainly because most people must fight continuously for
<br />
surviving.
<br />
<p>This question merits to be examined historically because very often, here
<br />
and there, it is commented that past events are facts that cannot longer be
<br />
modified; therefore most people are persuaded to ignore the causality of
<br />
everything that have already happened, without realizing that many of them
<br />
are already or will be employed for creating and building 'societal'
<br />
circumstances that are similar to those that caused the collapse of other
<br />
civilizations.
<br />
<p>The question requires also to be grasped psychologically. It seems valid to
<br />
assert that most humans during their early childhood are prone to be
<br />
aggresive against other children because evidently every child is
<br />
interested in identifying how to develop his/her peculiar personality. In
<br />
normal circumstances most children do not require too much time to notice
<br />
the need and convenience of cooperation which emerges from our intrinsic
<br />
gregariousness.
<br />
<p>At the dawn of our conventional 3rd millennium, many humans during their
<br />
whole life perform aggresively as children though using all kind of tricks
<br />
and weapons in order to succed. The societal conditions that the civilizing
<br />
processes have engendered have become stimuli that encourage them to fight
<br />
harder and harder, whatever the means, in order to reach a powerful
<br />
position. Such a fight is supported by cultural assumptions about the need
<br />
and convenience of using:
<br />
<p>*  the common people as human resources: slaves, serfs, lackeys, servants,
<br />
workers,  employees,... for improving the 'civilized' facilities that are
<br />
required by the 'nice' and 'beautiful' people - those who have always money
<br />
to buy everything, anything and nothing in order to really enjoy the
<br />
'civilized' way of life.
<br />
<p>*  some selected members of the masses of people for being trained as
<br />
soldiers needed for creating and maintaining an army that may fight
<br />
successfully against other armies.
<br />
<p>It is not sufficiently clear but it can be assumed that the prevailing
<br />
societal conditions during the last 6 or 8 millenia have impeded the
<br />
maturation of behaviour of those humans who have chosen to play an active
<br />
role competing in order to reach a a powerful position. Meanwhile the
<br />
masses of people usually had not other option than to play passive roles,
<br />
trying no more than surviving till the next day in accordance with
<br />
measures, laws and societal arrangements imposed by those who managed to
<br />
locate themselves in powerful positions, after defeating other competitors.
<br />
<p>Until today in practically every civilized society it is usual to argue
<br />
that conflicts among people are caused exclusively by dogmatic views of
<br />
idealized interpretations of what should be the role on the Earth of a
<br />
particular assemblage or bunch or clique of people. The history of the
<br />
whole civilizing adventure has been usually presented as being the outcome
<br />
of  events generated by views and interpretations that had been formulated
<br />
by masterminds, those who were clever enough to induce some humans to
<br />
defend traditional 'values', racial features, the land of a kingdom, a
<br />
Church or a Mosque or a Synagogue,...
<br />
<p>Most events, during the whole trajectory of the so called Civilization,
<br />
have been carried out by the common people, the masses who have been
<br />
induced or obliged to FIGHT AGAINST their ENEMIES. But the adversaries were
<br />
always groups or factions who had been induced by their leaders (also
<br />
masterminds) to fight against their adversaries.
<br />
<p>In fact, most leaders of such a kind were and still are basically
<br />
interested in conducting or obliging a certain number of people to expand
<br />
his/her empire, to conquer new territories,  to colonize the servants
<br />
conquered,... in order to organize properly the exploitation of everything
<br />
in order to generate monetary profits and other kinds of  opportunities for
<br />
the sake of business. In this 21st century these actions are quite
<br />
effectively organized by mass media, because the 'NEWS' about the
<br />
consequences of criminal actions (comprised the terrorist ones) easily
<br />
evoke everlasting emotions of:
<br />
<p>*	pity for the common people who suffer and died injustly in spite of
<br />
the increasing number of economic advances and technological innovations
<br />
that characterize the civilization trends, which are the outcome of
<br />
intelligent thinking implemented through skilfull actions for the sake of
<br />
progress inside the human world (homosphere).
<br />
<p>*	fear that such a kind of advances and innovations may be
<br />
effectively used as evil tools in order to make feasible all kinds of
<br />
fanatical ideologies (political, religious, ethnical, racial,...) knowing
<br />
that they are motivated by dogmatic views of idealized interpretations of
<br />
the role of humans on the Earth and are encouraged by legal and illegal
<br />
arms dealers who are making a lot of monetary profits.
<br />
<p>Von Bertalanffy voiced his insight that our civilization can only collapse
<br />
if nothing is changed in our conceptual apparatus. He believed that &quot;the
<br />
overall fate of the world depends on the adoption by humanity of a new set
<br />
of values, based on a general systems WELTANSCHAUUNG (worldview)&quot; ....&quot;We
<br />
are seeking another basic outlook: the world as organization. This
<br />
[outlook] would profoundly change the categories of our thinking and
<br />
influence our practical attitudes. We must envision the biosphere as a
<br />
whole ... with mutually reinforcing or mutually destructive
<br />
interdependencies. [We need] a global system of mutually symbiotic
<br />
societies, mapping new conditions into a flexible institutional structure
<br />
and dealing with change through constructive reorganization.&quot; (*)
