<p>Call for Abstracts
<br />
<p>Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p><p>The Washington Evolutionary Systems Society (WESS) is sponsoring a  
<br />
symposium on design concepts in evolutionary thought. Exploration of  
<br />
the conceptualization of designs is the principal objective of the  
<br />
symposium. The symposium is called:
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergences of Designs.
<br />
<p><p>The fundamental nature of design is adroitly described by Susan  
<br />
Oyama, in &quot;Evolution’s Eye&quot;.   “ The concept of design spans multiple  
<br />
disciplines.  It is applicable to most disciplines – from art to  
<br />
zoology and from artifacts to architectures.  The design of decisive  
<br />
experiments is essential to advancing physical progress.”  One may  
<br />
add that the design of chemical syntheses is essential to the  
<br />
chemical, material, and biomedical sciences, as well as the emergence  
<br />
of life.
<br />
<p><p>The art and science of design can be explored from several  
<br />
perspectives, as noted by Oyama. We seek to attract a wide variety of  
<br />
speakers who can explore the concept of design from particular  
<br />
perspectives.
<br />
<p><p>During the 1960s and 1970s, two books strongly influenced the  
<br />
development of systems theory, the works by Herbert Simon, &quot;The  
<br />
Sciences of the Artificial,&quot; and by Christopher Alexander, &quot;Notes on  
<br />
the Synthesis of Form.&quot;
<br />
<p><p>Subsequent advances in both mathematics (catastrophe, chaos, category  
<br />
theories, fractals and high speed electronic computation) and biology  
<br />
(the determination of genetic sequences, cellular and neural  
<br />
networks) allow us re-examine these influential texts from the  
<br />
context of the early Twenty-First Century.
<br />
<p><p>Major motivations for the symposium are recent advances in our  
<br />
understanding of biological dynamics, especially genetic and  
<br />
neurological dynamics. Numerous scholars are proposing that a  
<br />
fundamental basis of biological design is the contingent relations  
<br />
between internal and external dynamics.  Ab ovo, the contingency of  
<br />
processes appears to create opportunity for informed choices.  The  
<br />
concatenation of informed choices may be generative or non- 
<br />
generative.  The concatenation of various sources of information  
<br />
(physical, chemical, biological) appears to stimulate the creativity  
<br />
of future developments, the design of organisms. The works of Susan  
<br />
Oyama (Ontogeny of Information, Cycles of Contingency) include  
<br />
persuasive arguments for the critical dependencies relating  
<br />
biological development to environmental factors.  Thus, to a limited  
<br />
extent, the cyclic contingency of design processes can be juxtaposed  
<br />
to physical theories such as information in biomolecules or  
<br />
thermodeynamic &quot;negative entropy&quot;, as a source of motion for complex  
<br />
systems. In this exploration, we desire to discuss the historical  
<br />
roots as well as the historical forces that create design processes,  
<br />
such as the emergence of language, tools and habitats.
<br />
<p><p>We can pose several broad questions about the recent advances in the  
<br />
emergences of designs:
<br />
<p><p>Have new universal design principles emerged in recent decades?
<br />
<p>Is the art of design intrinsically creative or can it be systematized?
<br />
<p>What are the roles of symbol systems in shaping designs?
<br />
<p>What are the functions of codes and encoding and decoding of  
<br />
information in creating designs?
<br />
<p>Can designs be limited to single disciplines or must design be  
<br />
intrinsically multidisciplinary?
<br />
<p>Do general design principles exist that are equally applicable to  
<br />
both living and non-living systems?
<br />
<p>What is the appropriate role of computation in the emergence of a  
<br />
particular design?
<br />
<p>What distinguishes the design of computational from the design of  
<br />
material systems?
<br />
<p>Can the physical principles of design be applied to the design of  
<br />
social, legal and political systems?
<br />
<p>How do the informed codes of human communication influence design  
<br />
practice?
<br />
<p>To what extent can we say ethics and morals are designed?
<br />
<p>What should be the design of our internal security systems?
<br />
<p><p>The last question is of specific and immediate public concern and is  
<br />
a substantial motivation for the symposium. A practical example of  
<br />
the emergence of a design is our &quot;Department of Homeland  
<br />
Security&quot; (DHS).  It is an ongoing process. This critical  
<br />
governmental organization has emerged from both a variety of fears as  
<br />
well as real threats to our security.  To what extent has the  
<br />
government designed DHS to quell the public fears?  Can the DHS  
<br />
become a functional design?
<br />
<p><p>Behind these questions loom deeper questions about the nature of  
<br />
biological evolution itself.  Are the emergences of forms and  
<br />
functions of living systems adequately explained by chance?  The  
<br />
challenge of finding the dynamic sources of biological form and  
<br />
function remains even after adopting Darwinian and neo-Darwinian  
<br />
philosophies.  How is it that deterministic chemical and physical  
<br />
processes underlie the course of biological evolution?  In light of  
<br />
recent mathematical advances in chaos and category theory, what is  
<br />
the nature of the mathematics of evolutionary designs?   The recent  
<br />
highly emotional public debates on “intelligent design” merely  
<br />
occlude the difficult scientific questions waiting to be addressed.
<br />
<p><p>We seek to explore the nature of design by looking at the concept  
<br />
from the narrower perspective of individual disciplines and from the  
<br />
wider perspectives of multi-disciplinarians.  An example of the  
<br />
latter is NASA’s planning for a moonbase by the year 2020.  In this  
<br />
exploration, we plan to learn of the historical roots as well as the  
<br />
historical forces that create design processes, such as the emergence  
<br />
of language, tools and habitats.  Various sources of the complexity  
<br />
and the perplexity of the hierarchical design principles will be  
<br />
sought. It may be possible to identify systematic threads of  
<br />
relations that underlie the common emergences of designs in the arts  
<br />
and the sciences. We also anticipate comparing the logical dynamics  
<br />
that led to the separation of design strategies and tactics in  
<br />
various professional disciplines. .
<br />
<p><p>We invite papers concerns with both abstract and concrete  
<br />
descriptions of design processes, such as architecture,  
<br />
transportation systems, electronic medical services and similar  
<br />
social - cultural systems that may unconceal the hidden motivations  
<br />
of novel designs.  We look for suggestions and principles for  
<br />
emergent designs in public arena, such as the design of legislation,  
<br />
the design of public safety systems, the design of legal systems and  
<br />
similar topics, such as homeland security. The relative roles of  
<br />
logic, mathematics, narratives and intuitions in each discipline may  
<br />
provide clues toward improving design processes for social, cultural  
<br />
and intercultural organizations
<br />
<p><p>We invite abstracts from all relevant disciplines.  We encourage  
<br />
equally abstracts on the philosophy of designs and the design of  
<br />
philosophies.
<br />
<p><p>Abstracts are due by February 15, 2006. Abstracts will be reviewed  
<br />
for  relevance to the WESS community.  Abstracts must be submitted  
<br />
directly to WESS for consideration.
<br />
<p><p>The symposium will be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF)  
<br />
on March 25 and 26, 2006.
<br />
<p><p>Once again, the WESS symposium will be part of the Capital Sciences  
<br />
meetings that are organized and hosted by the Washington Academy of  
<br />
Sciences (WAS) at the NSF.  The WAS website ( http:// 
<br />
www.washacadsci.org/ )includes information on registration, location  
<br />
and other relevant information.
