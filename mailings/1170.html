Dear Luis, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A problem with &quot;sustainability&quot; has been that is was not clearly defined
<br />
in the Brundland report &quot;Our Common Future&quot; (1987, at p. 9), notably as
<br />
&quot;a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the
<br />
direction of investments, the orientation of technological development,
<br />
and institutional change are made consistent with future as well as
<br />
present needs.&quot; While one can measure present needs and investments, it
<br />
is extremely difficult to measure &quot;future needs&quot; particularly if one
<br />
does not specify the time horizon for these needs. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
For example, a development which can be characterized as sustainable
<br />
during the next 50 years may be unstainable when evaluated over het next
<br />
100 or 200 years. The alternative of bringing all fluxes in steady state
<br />
is not available because we have no central control center (like
<br />
&quot;Moscow&quot; in the former Soviet-Union). The ideas of Forrester and Meadows
<br />
were therefore sociologically naive. The new ideas often assume too
<br />
easily a common clockwork in the systems. I have written a paper about
<br />
this entitled  &lt;<a href="../../users.fmg.uva.nl/lleydesdorff/dto/index.htm">http://users.fmg.uva.nl/lleydesdorff/dto/index.htm</a>&gt;
<br />
Sustainable Technological Developments and Second-Order Cybernetics,
<br />
Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management 9, (1997, no. 3) 329-341;
<br />
preprint at <a href="../../www.leydesdorff.net/dto">http://www.leydesdorff.net/dto</a> . 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In practice, the discussion on sustainability has in the last few year
<br />
been boiled down to a set of criteria which includes both economic,
<br />
ecological and social viability of a new development. From this
<br />
perspective, an indicator scheme in three dimensions can be developed.
<br />
This scheme can be considered as an information system and perhaps be
<br />
improved by considering it thus more abstractly. For example, one can
<br />
raise questions about the value of the mutual information in three
<br />
dimensions. Perhaps, a development which is indicated as a negative
<br />
entropy can be sustained more (as a &quot;self-organizing&quot; system) than a
<br />
development which fails to do so. This is just a suggestion for the
<br />
operationalization using information theory.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards, 
<br />
&nbsp;

Subject: [Fis] Focussing our discussion
<br />
<p><p><p>Dear Jerry,
<br />
Dear All,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Answering to your last posting, I formulated my questions in the
<br />
introductory text, particularly questions 1-7, because I would like to
<br />
find some light concerning measurable properties (physical ones,
<br />
informational ones...) and/or methodologies, in relation with the
<br />
evaluation of natural resources and the interaction of our society with
<br />
the environment (how to measure the environmental impact provoked by
<br />
technological and economic activities?). That understanding could be
<br />
relevant for sustainable development. 
<br />
<p>Ecological economics basically deals with the distribution and
<br />
management of limited natural resources in order to reach a real
<br />
sustainable development, in which human beings and their social,
<br />
technological and economical development would be fully integrated with
<br />
nature creating a real constructive symbiosis. In my opinion, at the
<br />
present FIS discussion entitled &quot;Economical Ecologics and Information&quot;,
<br />
we are looking for the &quot;Scientific Fundamentals of Sustainability&quot;,
<br />
which is really a huge and major task with quite many different branches
<br />
and addresses of discussion.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the different postings received during this week I consider that
</em><br />
there are at least three different branches of discussion already open.
<br />
I suggest that we deal with the three of them in depth (and perhaps
<br />
separately):
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
1) Evaluation of natural resources (Pavel, in his very interesting
<br />
comments, has already advanced some thoughts about that).
<br />
<p>2) Evaluation or measurement of &quot;ecosystems health&quot; or in other words,
<br />
measurement of the environmental impact provoked by the activities of
<br />
human beings. This is related with the  previous issue, and both Jerry's
<br />
opening text and Pavel's posting have inspiring directions about the
<br />
problem of carrying capacity of Earth (e.g. Ascendancy). In my viewpoint
<br />
the carrying capacity of ecosystems does not only relate with the
<br />
depletion of natural resources but also with the quality or health of
<br />
ecosystems, 'polution' for instance. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
3) Formal characterization of markets. This a very wide and deep topic
<br />
suggested by Pedro, which is also present in several postings (Karl,
<br />
Pavel, Loet). It is likely to be one of the key points of the present
<br />
FIS discussion: the really dense relationship between natural
<br />
resources/ecosystems, value, price and information.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I hope this modest synthesis/suggestion could help us to focus our
<br />
further discussion efforts, and avoid the peril of becoming lost in this
<br />
vast and ambitious session. By the beginning of next week I will try to
<br />
prepare some further comments related with the first issue --Evaluation
<br />
of Natural Resources--which is the aspect closest to my own specialized
<br />
thermoeconomic field. 
<br />
<p>In the interim let me kindly invite to the experts on these three
<br />
fields, recently subscribed in the FIS list, to share their viewpoints
<br />
with all of us. 
<br />
<p>Have a nice weekend,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Luis
