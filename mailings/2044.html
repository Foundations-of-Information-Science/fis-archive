Dear Igor,
<br />
<p>I thank you for an overview. I largely agree, and appreciate your
<br />
explanatory devices. This posting is essentially about the utility of 
<br />
the notion of entropy and a more organic view of the economy and 
<br />
society, on an example of the way a farmer could be deciding what 
<br />
potatoes to planting and what potatoes to eat, just as societies and 
<br />
companies are performing selection on the humanity.
<br />
<p>=
<br />
<p>Perhaps entropy is not a good word. Perhaps I should call it &quot;tendency 
<br />
towards equilibrium&quot;, a staple of economics. Namely, that's what entropy 
<br />
is. I am not talking about the thermodynamic entropy, I'm talking about 
<br />
the metaphor of the final cause in general.
<br />
<p>There are several metaphors here:
<br />
* autocatalysis, source (efficient causes - the energizing potential at
<br />
present in time, the moving and shaking, emptying of the source)
<br />
* entropy, sink (final causes - the tendency towards equilibrium through
<br />
time, the goal and purpose, filling the sink)
<br />
* hierarchy, network, constraint (formal causes - the constraints and
<br />
the patterns, that what cannot be moved)
<br />
* agent, interaction, motivation (material causes - the 'atoms' that
<br />
underlie the patterns and enact the constraints, that what cannot be split)
<br />
<p>Agents and interactions between them are the molecules that everything
<br />
is made of. Hierarchies and networks are the structures that one can
<br />
then perceive, trying to make sense of the bouncing and bumping down below.
<br />
<p>Autocatalysis explains the growth of a company. Entropy explains the
<br />
loss of direction and motivation, the increase in local self-interest
<br />
that causes the death of a company. The life-cycle is the gradual
<br />
transition from an autocatalysis-dominated system to an
<br />
entropy-dominated system in the absence of self-cleaning. Subareas of 
<br />
the industry, too, do not have an interest to lose energy in their 
<br />
interactions, but try to streamline the processes through bottom-up 
<br />
initiative.
<br />
<p>So your set of explanatory devices does appear to be complete in the 
<br />
above sense of having all four causes. In that sense, I can understand 
<br />
your reluctance to see where entropy would fit: you already have the 
<br />
analogous notion of the sink. I am biased in prefering the metaphors I 
<br />
have more experience with, but these metaphors may be complementary.
<br />
Yes, there are systems that are best explained in terms of sinks and 
<br />
sources, and other systems that are best explained in terms of 
<br />
autocatalysis and entropy. Growth, indeed, is nicely described in terms 
<br />
of autocatalysis (order aligning the surrounding disorder) than through 
<br />
physicalist notions of &quot;force&quot; or &quot;gravitation&quot;. But the gradual 
<br />
reduction of efficiency in a company can be described both as the 
<br />
emptying of the source, and as the decrease in the alignment of agents 
<br />
in a company: the selfish agents on the inside as well as on the outside 
<br />
try to dissipate the gradient the company developed for their own benefit.
<br />
<p>BTW, I apologize if I sound uninformed: I am. It would be very helpful 
<br />
if the materials you cite were available online. Having information 
<br />
locked up in a journal somewhere is making it quite hard for people to 
<br />
read your work.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; well as the firm is subject to these processes in its wider environment -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the market). Autocatalysis stimulate competition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and selection in the sense that it streamlines preferentially energy and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material flows towards more efficient members, be these already inside the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loop or act at its periphery as potential &quot;new entrants&quot;. In the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process a new member who contributes more to the growth of the loop may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replace a less efficient member.  
</em><br />
<p>I pointed out that such naive self-cleaning action is dangerous in the
<br />
long run, because it dissipates the limited resource of efficient
<br />
members. A good farmer knows he shouldn't eat the biggest potatoes but
<br />
instead save them for seed next year, a wise company or country will
<br />
leave them alone. In our modern corporations and welfare countries,
<br />
we're eating the big potatoes with no regret, and nurturing the sickly
<br />
little potatoes, hoping that they will get a little bigger.
<br />
<p>To some extent, this is fair, as some of the big potatoes became big
<br />
because they were overcompetitive and kept the small potatoes in shade.
<br />
On the other hand, some small potatoes are small because they were lazy
<br />
and couldn't grow properly. In reaction to this we're elitistically
<br />
picking the biggest potato and glorifying it, although a potato could
<br />
only get that big by overshadowing and encroaching other potato plants.
<br />
In modern agricultural experiments, therefore, one chooses the best
<br />
rectangular section of the field to save for seed: that particular mix
<br />
of small and big potatoes together did the best. As a policy, it's a bit
<br />
unfair, but it's balanced.
<br />
<p>Let's rise a level higher: corporations, governments, religions and
<br />
cultures are the farmers I have in mind, and people are the potatoes.
<br />
For what I know, only religions have a balanced farming policy, even if
<br />
it's an expansionist one (will it work in a finite ecosystem?).
<br />
<p>Of course, if the farmer is biased towards selecting big potatoes, the
<br />
teamwork can emerge at a lower level. The potatos in a particular area
<br />
will collaborate, and elect and support the grand trophy Big Potato that
<br />
will be picked by the farmer. To justify the collaboration of the small
<br />
potatoes, however, the Big Potato carries the information to re-create
<br />
the whole area in the field, small potatoes included. This way, an
<br />
intermediate entity emerged that does what the farmer won't do himself.
<br />
<p>I apologize for the overabundance of potatomorphic metaphors. I do find
<br />
a potato a better analogy for general self-organizing systems than
<br />
either soulless inanimate &quot;objects&quot; or consciously reflecting
<br />
anthropomorphisms.
