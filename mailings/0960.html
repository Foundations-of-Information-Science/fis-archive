I am almost certain that systems analysis, cybernetics, information, 
<br />
organizational procedures have been used effectively for organizing 
<br />
efficiently the &quot;DIGITAL WAR&quot;. It is one of the main contributions of 
<br />
SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY for the future of Humankind which seems to be 
<br />
condemned by its decision makers to the apocalypse organized 
<br />
coherently by intelligent brains democratically oriented
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &lt;answer.general&#64;action-mail.org&gt; (A.N.S.W.E.R.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Subject: [ANSWER]: Iraqis can't turn off the TV to make the war go away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Date: Tue, 01 Apr 2003 21:52:24 -0500
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The whole world is watching us die&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the face of Iraqi resistance to the invasion, the U.S. military 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strategy has abruptly shifted in the last few days. Instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;posing as liberators, the U.S. high command has called for open 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;warfare against the Iraqi civilian population. In the last 48 hours, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hundreds of civilians have been shot down on the roadways, in their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;homes, on their farms. The aerial bombings are becoming more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indiscriminate as missiles land in markets and residential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neighborhoods.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Iraq war has suddenly taken on the worst features of the U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;war in Vietnam. Facing a defiant and resisting population, U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;troops, under the direction of their officers, treat all members of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the population as suspect and decide to shoot first and ask 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;questions later. The U.S. soldiers have been lied to about their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mission. They have been sent to kill and be killed in a war for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empire and conquest, not liberation. U.S. casualties are mounting in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this war that need not have happened.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On March 31, there was a massacre of civilians, mainly women and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their children, whose crime was that they were driving on a roadway 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in their own country. As their van approached a checkpoint, U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;soldiers destroyed their vehicle with a barrage of 25mm cannon fire 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from one or more of their M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Washington Post quoted Capt. Ronny Johnson of the Army's 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Infantry Division in his series of orders to the troops present:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- &quot;Fire a warning shot&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- &quot;Stop [messing] around!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- &quot;Stop him, Red 1, stop him!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- &quot;Cease fire!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- &quot;You just [expletive] killed a family because you didn't fire a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;warning shot soon enough!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;shoot first - ask questions later&quot; strategy is not the result 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of spontaneous actions by scared and edgy troops. These are orders 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given the troops from the Pentagon high command.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Everyone is now seen as a combatant until proven otherwise,&quot; a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pentagon official is quoted in the Washington Post of April 1, 2003. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Pentagon recognizes that the shift in tactics will be understood 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a brutal escalation of force against the civilian population and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that their earlier posture as &quot;liberators&quot; will be exposed. &quot;You'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see acts of kindness, medical care and the like, but the large scale 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aid effort will have to wait,&quot; a Pentagon official told the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Washington Post. In fact the new U.S. strategy now is deliberately 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preventing Iraqi civilians in Nassiriya and other towns from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;receiving food and water unless they cooperate with the occupation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;forces.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;U.S. Marine Operations Commander Lt. Colonel Paul Roche told 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reporters on March 31 that the U.S. strategy towards the people of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the city of Nassiriya included the use of food and water as a weapon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to terrorize and break the will of the civilian population.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the April 1 front page of the Washington Post, the Pentagon's new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strategy is euphemistically referred to in the headline &quot;U.S. troops 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instructed to use tougher tactics.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The assault against civilians is being reported in greater detail 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and honesty by the world media outside the United States. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change in U.S. tactics is, as the following report shows, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encouraging the most racist and homicidal tendencies among U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;soldiers at the front.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is important to read the following passage from the UK Times of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sunday, March 30. It reports of a gruesome scene outside of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nassiriya. Some fifteen vehicles, including a minivan and a couple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of trucks, were found destroyed and riddled with bullets by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Times UK reporter Mark Franchetti:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Amid the wreckage I counted 12 dead civilians, lying in the road or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in nearby ditches. All had been trying to leave this southern town 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;overnight, probably for fear of being killed by US helicopter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attacks and heavy artillery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Their mistake had been to flee over a bridge that is crucial to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coalition's supply lines and to run into a group of shell-shocked 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;young American marines with orders to shoot anything that moved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;One man's body was still in flames. It gave out a hissing sound. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tucked away in his breast pocket, thick wads of banknotes were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;turning to ashes. His savings, perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Down the road, a little girl, no older than five and dressed in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pretty orange and gold dress, lay dead in a ditch next to the body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a man who may have been her father. Half his head was missing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Nearby, in a battered old Volga, peppered with ammunition holes, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Iraqi woman - perhaps the girl's mother - was dead, slumped in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;back seat. A US Abrams tank nicknamed Ghetto Fabulous drove past the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bodies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;This was not the only family who had taken what they thought was a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;last chance for safety. A father, baby girl and boy lay in a shallow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;grave. On the bridge itself a dead Iraqi civilian lay next to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carcass of a donkey.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The UK Times article also documents that in Iraq, just as in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Vietnam, the U.S. soldiers are being trained to wage war against a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;civilian population by dehumanizing those whom they are killing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;I'll Just Kill Him&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;As I walked away, Lieutenant Matt Martin, whose third child, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Isabella, was born while he was on board ship en route to the Gulf, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appeared beside me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot; 'Did you see all that?' he asked, his eyes filled with tears. 'Did 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you see that little baby girl? I carried her body and buried it as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best I could but I had no time. It really gets to me to see children 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being killed like this, but we had no choice.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. 'The Iraqis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are sick people and we are the chemotherapy,' said Corporal Ryan 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dupre. 'I am starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a friggin' Iraqi. No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him.' &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Crimes Against Humanity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;George Bush and the high command are guilty of crimes against 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humanity and war crimes. What we are witnessing is a full-scale 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;massacre carried out from the land, the air and the sea assault. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;U.S. media presents the war as carefully packaged propaganda and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trivializes the actual human costs of the war by turning it into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something of a spectator sport. But the Iraqi people cannot escape 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this war and they cannot turn off their television to make it go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, it is the non-U.S. press that reveals the extent of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;criminality of the war.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A March 29 Reuters article entitled &quot;Iraqis Delirious with Grief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After Missile Attack&quot; described the Friday night attack by U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bombs in a poor section of Baghdad. Arouba Khodeir, 39, while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;wailing hysterically and hitting herself in the face and chest, as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;women around her were trying to calm her down,&quot; spoke of her 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;11-year-old son Karar who died outside the house with his friends: &quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'My son had his head blown off,' screamed Khodeir. 'Why are they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hitting the people? Why are they killing the children? Why are they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doing his to us? Why are they attacking civilians? Didn't Bush say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on TV that he won't attack civilians. But these people who died are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all civilians? Is this a target?' she wailed, pointing at the dried 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;blood of her son still splashed on the walls.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The Whole World is Watching Us Die&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The report also described the killing of Shaza Shallum, 20, who was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;holding her baby and walking with two relatives when the explosion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sent a shard of shrapnel through her neck. Six-month-old Fatma was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;found alive in her dead mother's arms and brought by neighbors to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;her grandmother. The wails of the mourners drowned the cries of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hungry infant.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of the people living in this neighborhood told Reuters: &quot;We are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;helpless people. It is all out of our hands. Why cannot the world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find a solution? The whole world is watching us die and is doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing to help us.&quot;

<p>APRIL 12: The World Stands Together Against War
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On April 12, people of conscience all over the world are marching, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rallying, and carrying out massive protests in solidarity with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suffering people of Iraq. The people who are being killed are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our enemies, they are our sisters and brothers. They must not be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allowed to think that the world is &quot;doing nothing&quot; as the violence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is inflicted upon them. Thousands of young men and women in the U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;armed forces either oppose the war or are going through a process of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;questioning about the mission. It is crucial that the people of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;United States come together to demand: Stop the War Against Iraq / 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bring the Troops Home Now.
