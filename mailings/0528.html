Dear Norbert:
<br />
<p>Thank you for that clarification of your concept of metabolism. I guess
<br />
the differences between us to remain pretty deep, after all.
<br />
<p>I don't like to argue about the meanings of words, but &quot;metabolism&quot;
<br />
after all means &quot;anabolism&quot; &amp; &quot;catabolism&quot;, that is, the building up and
<br />
breaking down of polymers. Nothing remotely like this is going on in a
<br />
hurricane, I think you will agree. So, isn't it misleading to take a
<br />
word with a well-established meaning in biology, and apply it to a
<br />
non-biological system, when there is not even a real analogy between the
<br />
dynamics of the two cases?
<br />
<p>But that aside, I see the more important difference in the phenomenon of
<br />
energy autonomy. A hurricane is an open system, yes, but it is a slave
<br />
to the local thermodynamic gradients in its vicinity. It spontaneously
<br />
tries to resist its own destruction to some extent, but that extent is
<br />
extremely limited precisely due to the tight thermodynamic coupling to
<br />
its surround. I think the essence of life is the fact that living things
<br />
are NOT tightly coupled thermodynamicall to their surrounds in the same
<br />
way. Rather, they are buffered and have internal energy stores which
<br />
they can use selectively to work against local gradients (e.g., by
<br />
moving ions against osmotic gradients).  Think, too, of how a cell may
<br />
speed up its activity when it is short on fuel (in order to find new
<br />
sources), instead of slowing down, as one would expect of an inorganic
<br />
system, open or otherwise.
<br />
<p>A cell does not achieve this ability to apply work in a goal-directed
<br />
manner by clarivoyance, it does it by means of a cognitive-like process
<br />
which I believe consists essentially of using low-energy environmental
<br />
inputs as signs (in Peircean terms, icons) of the &quot;correct&quot;
<br />
circumstances the cell is seeking. (BTW, there is not necessarily any
<br />
implication here of sentience in the sense of conscious awareness.)
<br />
Naturalizing my use of the word &quot;correct&quot; in the previous sentence is
<br />
the essence of the problem here.  It is the heart of the normative and
<br />
teleological character of life which differentiates it from nonlife. I
<br />
personally think this naturalization ultimately has to be done via
<br />
quantum field theory, but be that as it may, the relative energy
<br />
autonomy from the immediate surround is the hallmark of life, and the
<br />
key factor differentiating cells from inorganic nonlinear oscillators
<br />
like hurricanes, Benard cells, etc.
<br />
<p>I just don't see the utility of glossing over this crucial distinction.
<br />
Rather, it seems to me we need to focus on the distinction and try to
<br />
understand how the emergence of energy autonomy (with cognitively
<br />
guided, goal-directed work) out of inorganic open systems was possible.
<br />
<p>James
