                <p>
                    Dear Andrei,
                    <br />
                <p>Let me answer to your questiona:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I follow your argument, I should again come
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to picture of OBJECTIVE REALITY and human beings creating models of this
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality
                    </em><br />
                <p>A system of counting does not reflect &quot;objective reality&quot; in a strict sense.
                    <br />
                    It may be useful to predict the movements of the Moon, of salmons or of
                    <br />
                    hurricanes. The proposal is that a counting system enriched by units that
                    <br />
                    measure dissimilarity as matter-of-fact, routinely as similarity, can be
                    <br />
                    even more useful to predict the movements of the Moon, of salmon and of
                    <br />
                    hurricanes. Using two eyes instead of one does neither enhance the
                    <br />
                    objectivity, the truth or the reality of the picture, it merely helps. Using
                    <br />
                    two counting systems instead of one does nothing towards making it more
                    <br />
                    real, objective or mighty. It may turn out to be more useful.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you speak about similarities, then these are similarities of
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; what? only our thoughts? or something more?
                    </em><br />
                <p>As to what is the similarity between two things that you perceive as &quot;the
                    <br />
                    same just bigger&quot; or &quot;the same just elsewhere&quot; or &quot;the same just at another
                    <br />
                    time&quot; or &quot;the same just more of it&quot; consist of will depend on what the two
                    <br />
                    things are that you compare and find that they are the same, just ...
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Neanderthals-people were not able to observe similarity in
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; events of coming salmon each year at the same time (this is the real
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact), but our preceders were able to do this. So it is in common
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; agreement with your theory. But it was objective reality of salmons? or
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was a question of our consencus?
                    </em><br />
                <p>As to Neanderthal and us: what has changed is that we recognise that salmons
                    <br />
                    keep returning every year; this they did not grasp. What has remained the
                    <br />
                    same: they and the most of us do not use the dissimilarity property of
                    <br />
                    members of assemblies. The Neanderthals have chosen to observe the
                    <br />
                    similarities between and among mammuts to evolve the conceptual unit of a
                    <br />
                    mammut. Likewise they have chosen to observe the similarities between and
                    <br />
                    among trees to evolve the conceptual unit of a tree, and likewise they have
                    <br />
                    chosen to observe the similarities between and among fingers to evolve the
                    <br />
                    conceptual unit of a finger. Then they have observed the similarities
                    <br />
                    between and among the conceptual units describing a unit of mammut, a unit
                    <br />
                    of tree and a unit of finger, and have introduced the concept of a unit of a
                    <br />
                    unit. This has stayed up to today the basic of our concept of a unit, based
                    <br />
                    in similarity.
                    <br />
                <p>What they have not done, is to observe the inner dissimilarities within a
                    <br />
                    group of mammuts, a group of trees and a group of fingers and to abstract
                    <br />
                    this unit of difference into a unit.
                    <br />
                <p>We stay with the Neanderthal tradition. In this point, there is much of
                    <br />
                    similarity between us and the Neanderthals.
                    <br />
                <p>We would break with the Neanderthal way of counting if we started using the
                    <br />
                    units of difference alongside the units of similarity, regardless whether we
                    <br />
                    count mammuts, trees or fingers, or units as such.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>A counting system has nothing to do with reality or salmons or mammuts. A
                    <br />
                    counting system has to do with units. The freedom to choose lies in the
                    <br />
                    alternative which properties of the mammuts (trees, fingers, units) we
                    <br />
                    utilise: how they resemble one another or how they differ to each other.
                    <br />
                <p>The proposal is to use a tandem-like counting system and observe with an
                    <br />
                    increased exactitude the objects. The technique would be like using stereo
                    <br />
                    in sight or radar or hearing.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>Information lies in the deviation between the results of the counting in the
                    <br />
                    two systems. This is what FIS looks into. The consensus is that we have
                    <br />
                    found what we were looking for (what is information and how can we master
                    <br />
                    its use), and that it lies in the slight difference between diversity-based
                    <br />
                    and similarity-based counting systems.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>Hope you can join the consensus.
                    <br />
