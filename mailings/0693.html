Dear John Holgate
<br />
<p>Sorry to answer so late on your question on abduction, but I have been on conference and holiday.
<br />
<p>To my understanding abduction is very central to Peirce' s theory of semiotics and logic. There is not classical logical inferential power or determinism behind abduction. It is always done on a basis of too little knowledge, but it is the function central to perception, making sense of things or in short to create a sign relation: signification. 
<br />
<p>Thus meaning is important in this function. From our present theories of intelligence, information and cognition we cannot grasp this function. We know it bears on context, and how this context is seen by the observer and the interest with which he or she enters it. The biological, psychological and social relations and their history and relations to the habits of nature and society are important, and therefore the informational, the semiotic and the linguistic levels of communication all influences the process. But it is in the end still based on the free will of the individual and the individual way it constructs its 'signification sphere' (Umwelt).
<br />
<p>The frame work I am writing within is further explain in the paper I  have given to this conference. It is a bit different from most participants I think. But it is based on a theory on the relation between  physical descriptions, information science, semiotics and  language as four different levels of reality  encompassed in a cybernetic interpretation of Peirce's semiotics.

Pedro, 
<br />
<p>You commented:
<br />
<p>&lt;One possible referent to consider about abduction, besides the 
<br />
&lt;philosophical conceptualizations, might be the social realm.
<br />
&lt;It would be very interesting that we could manage to establish a family 
<br />
&lt;resemblance between the different approaches to abduction --philosophical, 
<br />
&lt;biological, social...
<br />
<p>Since the provenance of the modern concept of abduction is often ascribed to 
<br />
C S Pierce's pragmatism it would be interesting to hear from Soren or Edwina 
<br />
on this one (Edwina has just done that succinctly linking philosophical abduction
<br />
to 'new interactions' between minor premisses with the sign system).
<br />
<p>We probably need to clarify the different domain definitions a bit.
<br />
<p>In the medical field abduction (movement of a limb away from the median 
<br />
plane of the body) has a counterpart in adduction (towards the body). 
<br />
<p>How is that connected to the philosophical concept?
<br />
<p>Pedro, I was interested whether 'adduction' also operates at the cell level -
<br />
possibly more likely than induction and deduction &lt;:)
<br />
<p>In philosophy, abduction (from 'apagoge' rather than 'abducere') is arguing 
<br />
from a minor premiss where the major premiss is given. Adduction/abduction
<br />
represents a movement between adducing best evidence (citation) and the experiential
<br />
mapping from an accepted 'body' of knowledge (heuristics, instructions etc).
<br />
The Oslerian medical model, for example, has operated under this paradigm.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The classical movement of induction/deduction (between the general and the particular) 
<br />
operates in the background of the abductive process. According to sociologists 
<br />
like Berger and Lukacs abduction (without the dynamic coherence of a rational
<br />
dialectic) can lead to 'reification' and its converse anthropomorphism (where IMHO McLuhan was 
<br />
heading by mechanicising the 'message'). If you accept the 'triadic sign' framework
<br />
of semiosis you can avoid that dilemma (just as accepting the doctrine of the
<br />
trinity solves the odd theological paradox) but that doesn't cater for the
<br />
more pentecostal (Batesonian) view of abduction:
<br />
<p>&quot;All thought would be totally impossible in a universe in which abduction was not expectable.
<br />
. I am concerned with changes in basic epistemology, character, self, and so on. 
<br />
Any change in our epistemology will involve shifting our whole system of abductions. 
<br />
We must pass through the threat of that chaos where thought becomes impossible.&quot; 
<br />
Gregory Bateson (Mind and Nature)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<a href="../../www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html">http://www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html</a> 
<br />
<p>At this point we probably need a tag wrestling match between Bateson and Pierce
<br />
and their supporters... 
<br />
<p>With respect to 'media' clearly the Internet is a marvellous playground for abductive thinking
<br />
since major premisses are rarely challenged as we bounce between minor premisses as
<br />
we are doing right now! The Web has no Top Gun. The game is largely in the searching and mapping of received notions - an intellectual trash and treasure hunt in which the truth is 'out there somewhere' (Pedro's 'multiple 'bubbles' with almost nothing but a referent to an outside, patchy framework' like the hyperlink above).
<br />
<p>The third meaning of 'abduction' (seduction, kidnapping, UFO's etc) which
<br />
dominates the media may not be unrelated to the other senses (or even
<br />
to James Barham's idea of 'fooling interaction' in an informational process).
<br />
Maybe Rafael's concept of 'angelia' (Botschaft or intercessionary communication)
<br />
could link this in rather nicely while avoiding the Scylla of Shannon/Miller
<br />
communication theory and the Charybdis of McLuhanism. 
<br />
<p>John C may be right in thinking that following 'abduction' may abduce us further 
<br />
down the garden path but it might be an enjoyable and significant stroll. 
<br />

<p>I would love hearing further thoughts from you two, and any interested 
<br />
party, about these different approaches to (philosophical?) abduction. In 
<br />
my own excursions onto biological (cellular) abduction I have always 
<br />
stumbled on the conceptual-cluster problem: the parallel need to articulate 
<br />
coherently several impossible concepts (function, life cycle, knowledge, 
<br />
symmetry-breaking, functional void...). I wonder whether, philosophically, 
<br />
something similar occurs.
<br />
<p>One possible referent to consider about abduction, besides the 
<br />
philosophical conceptualizations, might be the social realm. I mean, what 
<br />
is the 'info' mission of our means of communication? How do media fabricate 
<br />
'news'? Actually, the doings and workings of the famous 'media' of our 
<br />
societies, that we take for granted, were brought to the attention of 
<br />
scholars by Marshall McLuhan. In spite of the rather unfavorable view that 
<br />
most social scientists nowadays have on his work, I believe that he was 
<br />
very fertile. Particularly, in some parts of his analysis the 'abduction' 
<br />
idea looms. His slogan the 'media is the message' somehow suggests about 
<br />
the 'voidness' landscape that accompanies the media abduction of 
<br />
news...  multiple 'bubbles' with almost nothing but a referent to an 
<br />
outside, patchy framework. (But probably this is too biased an 
<br />
interpretation of mine).
<br />
<p>It would be very interesting that we could manage to establish a family 
<br />
resemblance between the different approaches to abduction --philosophical, 
<br />
biological, social...
<br />
