Reply to Pedro:
<br />
<p>your story is a nice metaphor of the relative &amp; arbitrary efficiency of 
<br />
markets. Like in the case of the nail, in most instances the price of a 
<br />
product/service depends on the current socio-cultural perception of its 
<br />
value and is only vaguely related to its &quot;objective&quot; or intrinsic 
<br />
properties. Only a few years ago the price of oil reached the bottom of 10 
<br />
US$ /barrel - reflecting our preference for economic growth, cheap food and 
<br />
globalized trade in almost everything that may be consumed. At the same time 
<br />
it was well known for several years that exploitation of oil reserves is 
<br />
expected to reach the peak by the 2020-2030 and from then onwards start its 
<br />
irreversible, steep decline. The price mechanism does not take this 
<br />
information into account in spite of the fact that considerably higher oil 
<br />
prices would stimulate early introduction of new technologies (in terms of 
<br />
energy efficiency) and development of alternative energy sources. Since this 
<br />
is believed to occur at the expense of economic growth and personal 
<br />
consumption in developed countries, our long terms socioeconomic goals are 
<br />
being sacrificed for short term preferences. In my opinion it is entirely a 
<br />
cultural  fact that we value more short term personal material consumption 
<br />
than future political/economic stability and the prospects of life of our 
<br />
children. Other cultures in a similar situation may have acted differently, 
<br />
so this is ultimately the question of the worldview.
<br />
<p>The story is also suggestive of the technology bubble burst in 2000/2001. 
<br />
Our (cultural) belief in prospects of high technology (IT in this case) 
<br />
fueled by media and mainstream economics (the illusion of &quot;new economy&quot; that 
<br />
will free us from the business cycle, as NCE economist R. Dornbusch voiced 
<br />
in the mid nineties) and combined with speculatory greed for profits drove 
<br />
the value of IT companies to tens of times their book value (the relation 
<br />
with the &quot;intrinsic&quot; value was completely lost). Then the bubble burst and 
<br />
we learned about WorldCom and other scandals...
<br />
The problem is that mainstream economics (NCE) has no way to deal with &quot;nail 
<br />
stories&quot;, past and future alike.
<br />
<p>All the best
<br />

Subject: [Fis] nail found in Zaragoza
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After the recent exchanges, let me try a possible way to put economic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things in a more clear sense. It could be through the distinction between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;infostructures&quot; and &quot;infrastructures&quot; --the former built up upon our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbolic capabilities, neatly informational, and the latter being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; productive operations that by themselves involve the usual physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes and laws (not only entropy growth!). Conversely to Marxian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; views, the infrastructure would be docilely conduced by the infostructure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (with dense feedbacks, of course, and admittedly following too schematic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an approach).  The sort of infoeconomic or infodynamic processes governing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the material part of the economy involve very familiar terms --eg, value--  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that perhaps we can recast  by some of the ideas argumented here, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly by Bob and Igor.  A little story on &quot;the nail found in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zaragoza&quot; may be illuminating...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a very hot day, walking along the fields surrounding this very place 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (CPS, in Zaragoza ouskirts) a student finds a big nail, very old artifact, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite rusted, almost scrap. Its value: just as scrap iron, merely around 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one cent ---if any of the recycling companies could be interested buying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. However the student is curious, and takes the nail in order to show it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to some historians. It looks interesting: its manufacture is genuinely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; medieval, it bears some marks or signs , etc. The value now ascends: one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hundred euros are offered by these new interested parties. Well, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; erudite archeologist intervenes: those marks are inscriptions that can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deciphered and become latin &amp; french anagrams, and who knows why, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nail is starting to attract big media coverage--- journalists, local 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; museum, collectors, etc. Now all these new social networks which have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; altered are escalating the value to several thousand euros. Unbelievable, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the most reputed erudite of this region (Aragon) reports that the nail 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself belongs to... Roldan and Charlemagne themselves!!! To their joint 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; war-chariot, in their frustrated siege of Moorish Zaragoza millennia ago). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Big, big hysteria: regional and national politicians, journalists and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; novelists, all of Spanish and French Media, numerous TVs, Academies, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; European museums, Hollywood producers,  treasure hunters.... The value 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emanating from the massive perturbation of a terrific number of flickering 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; social networks (&quot;disrupted bonds&quot;) is taking the value now to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; millions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Helas, as it frequently happens, it was an elaborated fake. Big scandal, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dense silence. The nail returns to the one cent value ---end of the story 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (it literally happened in a museum in Israel, cheated around a King 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Salomon's artifact, priced around one million--the source of my little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story on the nail).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry for the bla, bla, bla, and for conflating notions of value and of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; price. I just wanted to argue on the need to explore the info nature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value, reconceptualzed as &quot;ascendancy&quot; derived from the activation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multidimensional networks, being symbolically proyected onto a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cardinality, and then becoming &quot;prized&quot;. Yes, it deals with a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event, but when we regiment in markets and accounting systems all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularity of social production systems, we keep a strong record of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; social ascendancy of all the parties and processes involved (eg, look at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the enigmatic valuation of &quot;art works&quot; --the most expensive items of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; societies). It is along similar lines, I think, that we might re-enter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions of social entropy and other new ways of analysis, and not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally as attempted in the present way by some.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are here, in this list, playing with several important pieces of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knolwedge, from different individual sources, that we must massage and put 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together with a lot of patience and common sense. It might be finally a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nicer story than the unfortunate &quot;nail found in Zaragoza&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the patience!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
