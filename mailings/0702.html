Dear John
<br />
<p>Thanks for the very profound understanding of my points. I guess you are right that the pattern fittings covers a range from nearly mechanistic to nearly intentional.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;My Book &quot;The Island of Science&quot; is unfortunately only in Danish (Videnskabens ø) and published by Nordic Summer University. You can find it at 
<br />
<a href="../../nsuweb.net/html/modules.php@op=modload&name=Publications&file=index">http://nsuweb.net/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Publications&amp;file=index</a>
<br />
<p>or start at <a href="../../nsuweb.net/html/index.php">http://nsuweb.net/html/index.php</a>  and take publications.
<br />
<p>We are only five millon Danes so we simply have learn other languages form early on to survive. Gives a different attitude, I guess.
<br />
<p>Best wishes

Dear Soren,
<br />
<p>Thanks for your elucidation of abduction.
<br />
<p>I see there are different schools of thought within Peircean semiotics.
<br />
Your frames of reference are slightly different to Edwina's.
<br />
<p>In reply to your comments:
<br />
<p>&lt;I do not believe that life and mind can be adequately described by mechanistic models and energy &lt;based causality and I do not think that information science will do the trick either.
<br />
<p>I wouldn't argue with that. As an information worker knowing what information is  
<br />
is and does is part of my raison d'etre. Other kinds of scientist can probably take it or leave it. I am interested in the linkages between consciousness, experience and informational conditions - what it is and does as distinct from what it 'means'.
<br />
<p>No, Information Science will not 'do the trick' on its own - it remains a pisspot science.
<br />
<p>I applaud the conclusion of your paper and your 'four corners' metaphor (as long as we don't retreat into our own professional space) since it attempts to save the individual mind from the rock of reductionism and the reef of solipsism (these days largely inhabited by scientists and
<br />
philosophers respectively). 
<br />
<p>&lt;I see information as a kind of formal cause working through pattern &quot;fitting&quot;. 
<br />
&lt;Meaning is communicated through sign games  as final causes and at the level of 
<br />
&lt;linguistic self-conscious free will, you might talk of existential causes.
<br />
<p>I have a mental picture here of Helmslev and Peirce holding hands with Kierkegaard (:
<br />
<p>Your reference to 'formal cause' reminds me of David Bohm's observation that the 
<br />
radio signal alerting the pilot (active information) is not causality at work
<br />
(like with say the propulsion of the airplane itself).
<br />
<p>Is your pattern 'fitting' a spontaneous or an intentional phenomenon?
<br />
My personal hunch is that the 'fit' is fuzzier than we think.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
<p>John H
<br />
<p>PS I spent a delightful Christmas in Aarhus in 1997 with
<br />
my wife's Danish relatives. Why are the Danes so damn good at
<br />
spoken English (compared to the rest of Europe)?
<br />
<p>PPS I have been trying to track down a copy of your Island of Science
<br />
in Australian libraries. No luck. Is it still for sale?

<p><p>Dear John
<br />
<p>I do not believe that life and mind can be adequately described by mechanistic models and energy based causality and I do not think that information science will do the trick either. I see information as a kind of formal cause working through pattern &quot;fitting&quot;. Meaning is communicated through sign games  as final causes and at the level of linguistic self-conscious free will, you might talk of existential causes.
<br />
<p>Thus I do not think that we can make a FIS without relating it to a theory of cognition, mind and meaning on one hand and  classical science on the other. I do not believe that FIS in itself can be the frame for it all. My take is to place it in between and leave the theory of meaning to semiotics. I am inspired by a systems theory of developing hierarchies.
<br />
<p>With an evolutionary view you will have to acknowledge that mind as we know it has emerged from nature. Thus you need a metaphysics that allows for this to happen. It seems that a mechanistic view claiming that basic reality is simple, mathematical and deterministic is contradictory to then evolutionary theory of mind. Complexity theory is one step out of this and on the way to a better explanation and information science is one further, but still we need somehow to allow for mind and qualia to be part of that basic reality. That is what Peirce do. He makes them immanent in Firstness thus making it possible for them to emerge and manifest more and more through the course of evolution.
<br />
<p>I think that where Edwina and I depart is that she takes a radical pan-semiotic interpretation of Peirce (which is possible) and I want a moderate on that can fit in science as we know it into a bigger scheme without violating the result we have so far, but relativising them. 
<br />
<p>Finally I do not believe that  science  or any other explanatory system in language can explain everything in a precise manner that makes it possible to make fairly precise predictions. I share with Peirce a belief in a spontaneity of nature at the basis of existence. This can also be seen as the prerequisite for the possibility of a free will in humans, which scientists have to deny (Churchlands fx.).

Dear Soren,
<br />
<p>Thanks for your comments.
<br />
<p>Frankly I think Peirce's hirsute nomenclature could do with a decent shave from Occam's razor (:
<br />
but his insights are provocative. I am neither a semiotist nor , as Ionesco might have said, an anti-semiotist but a discussion about 'meaning' and foundations of information science (John Collier's original thread) needs to address the viability of abduction as a force in a unifying theory.
<br />
<p>Is semiosis is to be the corner stone of our 'information science'? If so then signification
<br />
(sign games) and the abductive method rather than classical syllogistic (or Florido's alethic)
<br />
logic is our starting point. Alternatively , if 'information science' is to be based on a theory of 'meaning' that's a whole new ball game. 
<br />
<p>You wrote:
<br />
<p>&lt;Thus meaning is important in this function. From our present theories of intelligence, &lt;information and cognition we cannot grasp this function. We know it bears on context, and how &lt;this context is seen by the observer and the interest with which he or she enters it.
<br />
<p>If we separate meaning from classical logic (exemplified in Florido's concept of semantic information) as has occurred more or less in postKantian phenomenology (Heidegger, Derrida, Peirce etc) we are left with the admittedly vague function of abductive inference and
<br />
context-bound interest . Does it yield 'too little knowledge' for a working methodology which would satisfy all 'four corners'of your model?
<br />
<p>Some of course might argue that there is no necessary confluence of information and meaning
<br />
(cf Fred Dretske's 'Meaning, and the constellation of mental attitudes that exhibit it, are manufactured products. The raw material is information.&quot; in:Knowledge and the Flow of Information
<br />
1999 Preface). 
<br />
<p>&lt;To my understanding abduction is very central to Peirce's theory of semiotics and logic. There &lt;is not classical logical inferential power or determinism behind abduction. It is always done on &lt;a basis of too little knowledge, but it is the function central to perception, making sense of &lt;things or in short to create a sign relation: signification. 
<br />
<p>Peirce argues that abduction 'itself starts a question' which is possibly the link to
<br />
an informational context by 'implication' - abduction being 'an explanation which arises spontaneously upon considering that which in each circumstance has surprised us'.
<br />
<p>Since Peirce redefined 'induction' away from the classical sense towards
<br />
a heuristic principle of signification it may be fruitful to explore his six modes of abduction
<br />
(hunch/symptom/metaphor/clue/diagnosis/explanation). If we could make a connection between
<br />
'abduction' in the biomedical domain and 'abductive triggers' (surprise/novelty/anomaly) in phenomenology it could have considerable explanatory power for a unifying theory.
<br />
<p>Apart from the cognitive direction at Stanford (Aliseda, Konolige et al) has there been any work done in cybernetics in this area? I'm aware that that the Hawkesbury School here in Sydney
<br />
has produced some interesting results with abductive research in the field of agriculture (Vlad Dimitrov et al).
<br />

<p><p>Dear John Holgate
<br />
<p>Sorry to answer so late on your question on abduction, but I have been on conference and holiday.
<br />
<p>To my understanding abduction is very central to Peirce' s theory of semiotics and logic. There is not classical logical inferential power or determinism behind abduction. It is always done on a basis of too little knowledge, but it is the function central to perception, making sense of things or in short to create a sign relation: signification. 
<br />
<p>Thus meaning is important in this function. From our present theories of intelligence, information and cognition we cannot grasp this function. We know it bears on context, and how this context is seen by the observer and the interest with which he or she enters it. The biological, psychological and social relations and their history and relations to the habits of nature and society are important, and therefore the informational, the semiotic and the linguistic levels of communication all influences the process. But it is in the end still based on the free will of the individual and the individual way it constructs its 'signification sphere' (Umwelt).
<br />
<p>The frame work I am writing within is further explain in the paper I  have given to this conference. It is a bit different from most participants I think. But it is based on a theory on the relation between  physical descriptions, information science, semiotics and  language as four different levels of reality  encompassed in a cybernetic interpretation of Peirce's semiotics.

Pedro, 
<br />
<p>You commented:
<br />
<p>&lt;One possible referent to consider about abduction, besides the 
<br />
&lt;philosophical conceptualizations, might be the social realm.
<br />
&lt;It would be very interesting that we could manage to establish a family 
<br />
&lt;resemblance between the different approaches to abduction --philosophical, 
<br />
&lt;biological, social...
<br />
<p>Since the provenance of the modern concept of abduction is often ascribed to 
<br />
C S Pierce's pragmatism it would be interesting to hear from Soren or Edwina 
<br />
on this one (Edwina has just done that succinctly linking philosophical abduction
<br />
to 'new interactions' between minor premisses with the sign system).
<br />
<p>We probably need to clarify the different domain definitions a bit.
<br />
<p>In the medical field abduction (movement of a limb away from the median 
<br />
plane of the body) has a counterpart in adduction (towards the body). 
<br />
<p>How is that connected to the philosophical concept?
<br />
<p>Pedro, I was interested whether 'adduction' also operates at the cell level -
<br />
possibly more likely than induction and deduction &lt;:)
<br />
<p>In philosophy, abduction (from 'apagoge' rather than 'abducere') is arguing 
<br />
from a minor premiss where the major premiss is given. Adduction/abduction
<br />
represents a movement between adducing best evidence (citation) and the experiential
<br />
mapping from an accepted 'body' of knowledge (heuristics, instructions etc).
<br />
The Oslerian medical model, for example, has operated under this paradigm.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The classical movement of induction/deduction (between the general and the particular) 
<br />
operates in the background of the abductive process. According to sociologists 
<br />
like Berger and Lukacs abduction (without the dynamic coherence of a rational
<br />
dialectic) can lead to 'reification' and its converse anthropomorphism (where IMHO McLuhan was 
<br />
heading by mechanicising the 'message'). If you accept the 'triadic sign' framework
<br />
of semiosis you can avoid that dilemma (just as accepting the doctrine of the
<br />
trinity solves the odd theological paradox) but that doesn't cater for the
<br />
more pentecostal (Batesonian) view of abduction:
<br />
<p>&quot;All thought would be totally impossible in a universe in which abduction was not expectable.
<br />
. I am concerned with changes in basic epistemology, character, self, and so on. 
<br />
Any change in our epistemology will involve shifting our whole system of abductions. 
<br />
We must pass through the threat of that chaos where thought becomes impossible.&quot; 
<br />
Gregory Bateson (Mind and Nature)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<a href="../../www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html">http://www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html</a> 
<br />
<p>At this point we probably need a tag wrestling match between Bateson and Pierce
<br />
and their supporters... 
<br />
<p>With respect to 'media' clearly the Internet is a marvellous playground for abductive thinking
<br />
since major premisses are rarely challenged as we bounce between minor premisses as
<br />
we are doing right now! The Web has no Top Gun. The game is largely in the searching and mapping of received notions - an intellectual trash and treasure hunt in which the truth is 'out there somewhere' (Pedro's 'multiple 'bubbles' with almost nothing but a referent to an outside, patchy framework' like the hyperlink above).
<br />
<p>The third meaning of 'abduction' (seduction, kidnapping, UFO's etc) which
<br />
dominates the media may not be unrelated to the other senses (or even
<br />
to James Barham's idea of 'fooling interaction' in an informational process).
<br />
Maybe Rafael's concept of 'angelia' (Botschaft or intercessionary communication)
<br />
could link this in rather nicely while avoiding the Scylla of Shannon/Miller
<br />
communication theory and the Charybdis of McLuhanism. 
<br />
<p>John C may be right in thinking that following 'abduction' may abduce us further 
<br />
down the garden path but it might be an enjoyable and significant stroll.

<p>I would love hearing further thoughts from you two, and any interested 
<br />
party, about these different approaches to (philosophical?) abduction. In 
<br />
my own excursions onto biological (cellular) abduction I have always 
<br />
stumbled on the conceptual-cluster problem: the parallel need to articulate 
<br />
coherently several impossible concepts (function, life cycle, knowledge, 
<br />
symmetry-breaking, functional void...). I wonder whether, philosophically, 
<br />
something similar occurs.
<br />
<p>One possible referent to consider about abduction, besides the 
<br />
philosophical conceptualizations, might be the social realm. I mean, what 
<br />
is the 'info' mission of our means of communication? How do media fabricate 
<br />
'news'? Actually, the doings and workings of the famous 'media' of our 
<br />
societies, that we take for granted, were brought to the attention of 
<br />
scholars by Marshall McLuhan. In spite of the rather unfavorable view that 
<br />
most social scientists nowadays have on his work, I believe that he was 
<br />
very fertile. Particularly, in some parts of his analysis the 'abduction' 
<br />
idea looms. His slogan the 'media is the message' somehow suggests about 
<br />
the 'voidness' landscape that accompanies the media abduction of 
<br />
news...  multiple 'bubbles' with almost nothing but a referent to an 
<br />
outside, patchy framework. (But probably this is too biased an 
<br />
interpretation of mine).
<br />
<p>It would be very interesting that we could manage to establish a family 
<br />
resemblance between the different approaches to abduction --philosophical, 
<br />
biological, social...
