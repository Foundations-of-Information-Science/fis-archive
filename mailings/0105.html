Dear Pedro and Jose:
<br />
Dear Everyone:
<br />
<p>Pedro and Jose have put forward an interesting hypothesis.    In
<br />
responding to it, I am reminded of Arturo Rosenbluth and Norbert
<br />
Weiner's comments in &quot;The Role of Models in Science&quot;.  They classified
<br />
two types of models: material models and formal (or symbolic) models. 
<br />
While these ideas are slightly obsolete, they are worth quoting:
<br />
<p>They defines these as:
<br />
<p>&quot;A material model is the represntation of a complex system which is
<br />
assumed simpler and which is also assumed to have some properties
<br />
similar to those selected for study in the original complex system.
<br />
&quot;A formal model is a symbolic assertion in logical terms of an idealized
<br />
relatively simple situation sharing the structural properties of the
<br />
original factual models.&quot;
<br />
<p>They then puts the limitations of scientific models in perspective:
<br />
<p>&quot;Consider first material models.  They start by being rough
<br />
approximations, surrogates for the real facts studied.  Let the model
<br />
appraoch asymptocically the complexity of the real situation.  As a
<br />
limit, it will become identical to the real system.&quot;
<br />
<p>They continues by generating a Platonic ideal:
<br />
&quot; The ideal formal model would be one which would cover the entire
<br />
universe, which would agree with its complexity and which would have a
<br />
one to one correspondence with it.  Anyone capable of elaborating and
<br />
comprehending such a model in its entiriety would find the model
<br />
unnecessary because he could grasp the universe as a whole.  He would
<br />
possess the third category of knowledge described by Spinoza.&quot;
<br />
<p>When I read your &quot;Language of the Cell&quot;, I conjecture that it fits
<br />
between the simpler model of information theory  and the relative
<br />
ordering relationships and chemical structural graphs.  The language
<br />
appears to me as more complex than information theory but less complex
<br />
than chemistry.
<br />
<p>Thus, I would next ask, what advantages does it offer the practioner?
<br />
Can you give examples which compare this cellular language to the
<br />
information variety - for example, T. Schneider's 'molecular machine
<br />
theory' which is developed from information theory?
<br />
<p>The second issure is the question of the role of composition.  Have you
<br />
considered the role of potential commutative relations in sequential
<br />
compositions?  Would this give your partitioning relations deeper
<br />
meaning in terms of creating categorical algebras?
<br />
<p>Why reject chemical structures as a language for cells?
<br />
One reason is that no one knows how to calculate the information content
<br />
of chemical structures!  Nor, do we know how to calculate the total
<br />
number of possible isomers for nearly all molecules with more than a few
<br />
atoms.  Thus, we do not have a method to calculate the distributions
<br />
required for Shannon's formula!  The fact that experiments are conducted
<br />
in the material context of chemical structures certainly does not imply
<br />
that the symbolic analysis can be done only in terms of classical
<br />
physical-chemical variables!
<br />
<p>Would you see your compostional partitions as a way to leap over these
<br />
intractable chemical problems?
<br />
<p>I agree that this approach has some conceptual advantages - can these
<br />
conceptual advantages be clearly demonstrated with analysis of
<br />
biological observations?
<br />
<p>Cheers to all.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50015, Spain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Introduction: Positional versus Compositional Information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The notion of a &quot;language&quot; of cells does not look consistent in relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the standard views of Information Theory applied to biology. Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Shannon and Wiener (1948) distinguished between discrete, continuous, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mixed information sources, the standard application of their ideas to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biology of the cell has been heavily influenced by the DNA and RNA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequential structure, and only the discrete-positional case has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditionally considered (e.g., Gatlin, 1972). As a consequence, the lack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of distinction between &quot;positional&quot; and &quot;compositional&quot; forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information and the subsequent neglect of the latter--we are going to argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here--have implied an analytical dead-end concerning the possibilities of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elucidating formal mechanisms of cellular languages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In biology and in human to human communication, the assumed preconditions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for information transmission, and for any workable language, refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequences of messages containing combinations of symbols which will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepted (or emitted, or read, or transmitted, or deciphered) always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following a positional order. Therefore, Shannon's formula appears as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural way of measuring the average combinatory content of these messages,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and of establishing their relative index of surprise, in order to design
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate channels, codes, etc. A workable language can be created,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequently, as a series of grammatical (Markovian) rules to abide by when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connecting successive positional messages comprised within the dictionary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scope of the language.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, one can point at a number of instances in natural and social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication where symbols are used in a rather different way. Instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a &quot;positional&quot; context, a &quot;compositional&quot; one is the case. In this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative context, messages are exchanged as presences or absences of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols which have been accumulated upon predetermined sets of objects. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful positional relationships among the objects within the set or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among the symbols accumulated upon the objects are assumed. For example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; several glasses on a tray may contain a variable number of different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbolic items (ice cubes, soda, vermouth, olives, cherries). The set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glasses on the tray become the message, each glass being an individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object that accumulates several symbols which precisely configure it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishable object. Communication among two subjects could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established by the exchange of trays, with variable number of glasses and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable contents within them. Theoretically, that messages might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reliably distinguished and transmitted by this method &quot;of concurrent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing of discrete states of media&quot; has been postulated by Karl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Javorszky (1996). A whole body of partitional calculus (or granularity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algebra) has been envisioned by this author (Javorszky, 1995).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More reasonable examples of the compositional way of information exchanges
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be found in the communicational use of colors, odors and tastes by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual organisms; also in social insects' pheromones; and anecdotally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the etiquette &quot;language of flowers&quot;; and perhaps within musical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compositions and within the formative frequencies of vowels and consonants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our own spoken languages as well. The &quot;language of cells&quot;, we will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discuss here, may be one of the most interesting instances of communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by means of such compositional tools; and it has been the forerunner of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further means of biological communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marshall Mc Luhan's famous dictum &quot;the medium is the message&quot; and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular disdain this author showed about Shannon's information theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Mc Luhan, 1968) are worth be remembered when considering this fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between positional and compositional forms of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exchange.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Analyzing a Compositional Message
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When receiving a compositional message encrusted upon a set of N elements,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is very little a subject can do: just counting the presence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different symbols on each element of the set. Hence the elements can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grouped in homogeneous classes of overlapping or non-overlapping nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (each class is defined by the presence of a specific symbol, and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually demarcates a partition of the set N). After the classes defined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single symbols, the more complex coincidences of combinations of symbols
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (class overlaps) among the elements can be counted. It can be easily proved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all the possible countings of symbolic presences among the N elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the set, in the first case of linear or one-dimensional partitions for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single symbols, conduce to the whole set of partitions of N, known as E(N)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Javorszky, 1995). Whereas the coincidences or overlaps of successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combinations of two, three, four symbols, etc., can be considered as second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order partitions, third order, fourth order ones, etc.--E2(N), E3(N),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E4(N)...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematically, partitions are a very straight concept: the additive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decompositions of natural numbers. For instance, the set { (5), (4,1),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1) } represents the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; onedimensional partitions of 5. By adhering to this mathematical treatment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one can use the well-known partitional properties of numbers to discuss the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most probable logical states of a compositional message encrusted upon the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elements of the set N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The set of partitions E(N) can be transformed right away into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability body. The probability of any state of the set to exist as is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described by a specific partition is given by the relative frequency of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this partition among all partitions. For instance, on E(5) the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         1/7     - for states (5), (2,1,1,1) and (1,1,1,1,1) each,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         2/7     - for states with either 2 or 3 summands each,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         15/20   - for any summand to be an odd number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kmax is that number (1..n &lt; N) which generates the most numerous set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitions of N into k summands. In this most probable partitional state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set shows Kmax distinct summands with respect to a one-describing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension. In the case of E (5), there is a Kmax shared both by 2 and 3.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Heuristically, it appears that a compositional message can be univocally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described by its corresponding &quot;trace&quot; of unidimensional partitions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Javorszky, 1996), if a few additional statistical measures that act as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of context or shared background in the communicational process have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been previously established: most probable message length, ratio of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols/elements, structural depth, shallowness, etc. Then the use of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitions of further order (second, third, etc.) becomes redundant--and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its inclusion would notably complicate the mathematical description of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; message.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Additionally, the Kmax. dimension of every property or symbolic presence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be used as an origin or natural cannon to which the respective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deviations of successive messages can refer. This further simplifies the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitional &quot;trace&quot; describing a specific message in the context of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ongoing communication process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Karl Javorszky (1996) has argued that an efficient communication procedure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; massively parallel, can be built around such minimized partitional traces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or message simplifications. It seems to work particularly well with data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets of a moderate size, which are preferably prestructured and come in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi continuous stream, so that the number of possible symbols is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kept rather finite--although symbols might come from an infinite multitude,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there should be a relatively small collection of distinguishing items
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; employed at the communicational session, and their group relations should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not generate a cardinality overstatement symbols/elements above a certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the extent that Javorszky4s estimates are correct, the overall capacity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a compositional channel making use of discrete states of media can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generically expressed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; T(N) = E(N) exp ln E(N),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding T(N) as the number of different logical states which can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguished by means of collections of symbols put on the elements of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set N -only non-redundant states are counted, for redundant symbol groups
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can always substitute by single symbols, coalescing into a unique logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state. E (N) is the already mentioned number of partitions of the set N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Calculating the respective probabilities and taking logarithms, one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obtain an expression in bits for the compositional-channel capacity (or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entropy of a compositional information-source) somehow paralleling the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; famous Shannonian entropy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is also interesting the comparison between T(N) and the strictly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positional use of the same elements of the set N in a combinatory way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which, in principle, should provide a total of N! different messages or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical states). In this comparison, T(N) yields a larger number of logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states than N! for values of N in between 31 and 95, with a maximum around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 63-64. However, for N = 12, the number of combinations N! reaches a maximum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with respect to T(N).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seemingly, several parameters of the genetic code would correspond with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such max./min. extremes that characterize the compositional-positional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interrelationship (see Javorszky, 1995, for detailed expression of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these formulae and calculations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. A Partitional Approach to Cellular Communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can the above compositional considerations be applied to the analysis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of inter- and intra-cellular processes? Instead of DNA sequences, it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the natural target of this new approach should be the &quot;mysterious&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing operations performed by the cellular signaling system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The basic idea to play with is that any array (sample) of chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compositions detected by the set of cellular receptors may be recast as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitional state, for we may consider that it has been obtained by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishing the presence of a series of specific chemical signs within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an hypothetical set of N elements or receptor complexes--it is a transient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; message coming from the environment through an ongoing compositional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, an immediate question arises. Could the system of receptors,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; membrane-bound enzyme and protein complexes, second messengers, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dedicated kinase and phosphatase chains, be understood as an abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitional processing-system capable of extracting the minimized &quot;trace&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or relative information differences within the stream of incoming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compositional messages and physically transport these differences down to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; final effectors at the nucleus, cytoplasm, or membrane? That's the basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis these two authors are presently trying to explore.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If (and what a big &quot;if&quot;) cells would make use of formal tools of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partitional nature in their management by means of the cellular signaling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system of the compositional messages they receive, then the notion of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genuine cellular language, with specific dialects for every organismic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tissue, could be seriously argumented. And perhaps more interesting than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, quite a few other bizarre aspects of the signaling system could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; receive some more formal (and simpler) treatment: the cross-talk between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signaling pathways, the checkpoints relating signaling operations with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell-cycle stages, and even the widespread formation of aggregates and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Partitions are very direct formal tools, but at the same time sophisticated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones. For instance, if natural numbers are left to &quot;oscillate&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously their corresponding partitions are allowed to grow and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shrink (Javorszky, 1998), then there emerges a variety of self-organization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns and internally-driven numerical processes which seemingly parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the constructive/degradative aspects so prevalent in biological and social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurrences (and even physical ones).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monetary systems and the suggestion by one of us (Marijuan, 1998) about the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;currency&quot; role actually played by the set of second messengers in the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal measurement of cellular function might finally be stepping stones

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointing out in the same direction.
