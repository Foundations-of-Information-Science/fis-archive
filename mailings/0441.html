<p>
Michael Leyton has some ideas that I believe are leverageable for the 
<br />
FIS agenda, and in fact my (now delayed) FIS position paper employs 
<br />
some ideas which overlap, though in a way with which Leyton would 
<br />
likely disagree.
<br />
<p>The &quot;Symmetry, Causality, Mind&quot; book is probably not the best place 
<br />
to start. The more recent, more readable &quot;A Generative Theory of 
<br />
Shape&quot; is more accessible and can be read for free on-line. But as it 
<br />
is more focused on a specific problem, you'll have a little more 
<br />
extrapolation to do to apply it to our problem domain.
<br />
<p>Leyton's notion is highly antirealist: cognition as bound in 
<br />
representation; representation as bound in form; form understandable 
<br />
in terms of generative states and state translations. The mechanics 
<br />
of the translations are synthesized from the formal machinery of the 
<br />
perceiver, focused on the apparent external primitive phenomenon of 
<br />
&quot;causality.&quot; These mechanics are constituted from categoric types in 
<br />
the form of symmetry primitives. The primitives have shape metaphors. 
<br />
The primitives are manipulatable by topological transforms on the 
<br />
types, resulting in new types from fibre bundles. Examples are given 
<br />
from the domain of cognition in the first book and shape grammar in 
<br />
the second. This is the rough outline, but not how he would describe 
<br />
it, I am sure.
<br />
<p>Leyton's goal is not at all the same as that of FIS, though equally 
<br />
ambitious. He has the luxury of focusing on the receiver, and is 
<br />
developing causal mechanics where none really exist. FIS instead has 
<br />
taken the job of focusing on the nature of the information token; 
<br />
this is an area where an immensely popular theory already exists; 
<br />
albeit with inadequacy in key areas. So we cannot be so cavalier in 
<br />
avoiding the problems of how cognition colors world mechanics. And we 
<br />
have to worry about &quot;cognition&quot; of things like cells and elementary 
<br />
particles.
<br />
<p>Independently, I have been working with some of the same mechanics. 
<br />
My focus has been concerned with uncertainty where Leyton deals with 
<br />
discreteness; and system context where he deals with objects. But we 
<br />
have the same basic notions, notions which I will suggest in my paper 
<br />
are useful for the FIS agenda (excepting the sorting out of semiotic 
<br />
accounting):
<br />
<p>-- a notion that information is always &quot;situated&quot; by the receiver 
<br />
(requiring abandonment of first order logic and adoption of situation 
<br />
logic)
<br />
<p>-- a parsing of information by abstraction groups (namely by 
<br />
context-defined categoric types from that situation)
<br />
<p>-- a recognition that the most general flexible and leverageable type 
<br />
primitives -- for the abstraction groups -- are at the symmetry 
<br />
level. (This is a key religious preference that imputes a geometric 
<br />
mechanic of complexity theory rather than the &quot;statistical&quot; basis of 
<br />
the Santa Fe movement.)
<br />
<p>-- an application of group theoretic functions to denote state 
<br />
transforms of the types within the &quot;messages.&quot; (This allows, I 
<br />
suggest, the emergence of new &quot;levels&quot; of reality when certain 
<br />
complexity thresholds are reached. So cellular dynamics can &quot;emerge&quot; 
<br />
from particle physics.)
<br />
<p>I hope to have a meaningful contribution by the time of the e-conference.
<br />
<p>I am greatly encouraged to see Leyton's mechanics introduced into the 
<br />
FIS discussion.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
