                    <br />
                <p>Comment on Karl�s reply to Andrei:
                    <br />
                <p>please allow me to ask you not to include this person in your statement &quot;
                    <br />
                    we do not have at the moment the real understanding of information. It is
                    <br />
                    always reduced to the definition of probability, through entropy. &quot;
                    <br />
                <p>I publicly state - and probably this is the best podium to state this -
                    <br />
                    that I do have at the moment the real understanding of information.
                    <br />
                    AAAA: I guess you here claim you are a realist that has a real (true?)
                    <br />
                    understanding of information. A bold claim for being a realist to my mind!
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>You make a logical error by stating that the idea of information is always
                    <br />
                    reduced to the definition of probability, through entropy.
                    <br />
                <p>Let us separate the idea of information from its appearances (like the
                    <br />
                    idea of fire to one burning fire).
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: Well here you make a dualistic statement and immediately accepts the
                    <br />
                    realist model of speaking and thus assumes the validity of realism � which
                    <br />
                    is an illegal position attempting to criticize monism or even science.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>The idea of information is that - due to a small inexactitude in the
                    <br />
                    folding of one- into moredimansional metrics - there is a basic flaw in our
                    <br />
                    counting system, if we try to use it to understand outside reality (which
                    <br />
                    you have wisely assumed to exist).
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: If you try to defend realism this is a �wise� and probably necessary
                    <br />
                    assumption � however if you try to advance science beyond it state of
                    <br />
                    present paradoxes this is a devastating assumption.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>As long as we regard our rational system of counting in itself, like a
                    <br />
                    measurement instrument on the shelf of the laboratory, it is error-free,
                    <br />
                    tautologic and exact. As soon as we try to use it to count and measure the
                    <br />
                    outside, we run into difficulties.
                    <br />
                    Dealing with these difficulties, one can have following startegies:
                    <br />
                    * assuming that the outside does not exist at all: Arne's position, rejected;
                    <br />
                <p>AAAAA: This is why you cannot understand my position: I have never claimed
                    <br />
                    that the �outside� never exists � my claim it is illegal to �speak about�
                    <br />
                    it simply because we cannot feature it in words. �Whereof one cannot speak,
                    <br />
                    thereof one must be silent� ::Wittgenstein.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>* saying that we do not understand it: your position, rejected;
                    <br />
                    * checking the measurement instruments: my position, useful.
                    <br />
                    Our measurement instruments count solely and only on units that are similar
                    <br />
                    to each other.
                    <br />
                <p>AAAAA: Agree!
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>We disregard the logical diversity of the impressions we process.
                    <br />
                    By Darwin's laws, (AAAA: here you are a realist again!) we are rewarded (by
                    <br />
                    increased chances of reproduction) if we recognise the similar in a
                    <br />
                    multitude which has properties of similarity and dissimilarity. We perceive
                    <br />
                    the similar before a background of dissimilarity.
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: Agree!
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>That our nervous system is built like this should not discourage us from
                    <br />
                    investigating the properties of the background, too. We are like moths
                    <br />
                    being attracted to the light (of similarity) and I am a moth which says:
                    <br />
                    dark can have differing degrees. Wont we count the degrees of dark? The
                    <br />
                    answer, usually, is: what, dark! Dont you feel the truth? It is light that
                    <br />
                    attracts us!
                    <br />
                <p>AAAA: It�s a choice simply � we can analyse the background as well � I agree!
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>So, the dialogue does get a bit tedious.
                    <br />
                    Unfortunately, diversity is NOT exactly the opposite of similarity. One can
                    <br />
                    count in units of diversity. One can build a counting system based on units
                    <br />
                    of diversity. This D-based counting system neatly interacts with the
                    <br />
                    traditional, similarity-based counting system, generating lots of what
                    <br />
                    people call &quot;natural constants&quot; along the way.
                    <br />
                <p>AAAAA: I do not know about the D-based counting system (reference?) but I
                    <br />
                    follow your thoughts. Apart from the divergence mentioned below I think SOA
                    <br />
                    could benefit from using such a system of quantification.
                    <br />
                <p>So, the idea of information is deeply understood to mean the average
                    <br />
                    difference (torsion, slack) between counting systems, where one counting
                    <br />
                    system is based on axiomatis similarity of units, and the other is based on
                    <br />
                    axiomatic dissimilarity of units. (This is like saying that the basis of
                    <br />
                    our spatial seeing is the distance between our eyes and that we have two eyes.)
                    <br />
                    The realisation of information is best observed by assuming probabilistic
                    <br />
                    models of distribution of this bias.
                    <br />
                <p>AAAAA: And here you slips � not in interpreting the D-based counting system
                    <br />
                    � but in its application. You here fail to take the step necessary that
                    <br />
                    overthrows the realist�s belief system :: The fire you talking about � and
                    <br />
                    the domain which you apply your counting system is your personal EXPERIENCE
                    <br />
                    � not some imaginative reality. This is the only valid use we can make of
                    <br />
                    an IS-operator (Is-predicate).
                    <br />
                <p>So, please exclude me from your sweeping statement &quot;we don't understand
                    <br />
                    what information is&quot;, and thank you for the opportunity to add to your
                    <br />
                    statement &quot;we assume it to be a concept of probability theory&quot; the
                    <br />
                    clarification, that realisations of the slack showing itself under some
                    <br />
                    circumstances can well be modeled by using methods of probability theory.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>There is a small inexactitude in the measurement instrument (because it is
                    <br />
                    only one of two oculars). This inexactitude blurs the vision. Information
                    <br />
                    is not in the visual picture where it can be caught or declared to be
                    <br />
                    statistical phenomen: information is the inexact nature of a mono-logical
                    <br />
                    describing system. The inexactitude adds up and loses the picture, making
                    <br />
                    us belkieve that the picture is blurred. The blurs can be discussed by
                    <br />
                    means of probability theory, but a better idea is to use the other half of
                    <br />
                    the stereo-logical description tool, too, and the vision will be beautiful.
                    <br />
                <p>AAAAA: However there is a more urgent and pressing need for using
                    <br />
                    probability calculus � this is a way we can provide the LAWS OF EVOLUTIONS
                    <br />
                    OF EXPERIENCE that are used to predict future happenings.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Finally to my mind you have still some crucial steps to take in order
                    <br />
                    suggest a useful model of information. You must let go your realist
                    <br />
                    conviction.
