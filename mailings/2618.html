                <p>&quot;...You must not think you, anyone else, or science can know what is
                    <br />
                    �out
                    <br />
                    there� � without the use of a mind (experiential mind) � specifically
                    <br />
                    your
                    <br />
                    own. This is why information has no mind-independent existence �
                    <br />
                    information
                    <br />
                    is mind-dependent and depends on your personal experience. This is
                    <br />
                    why we
                    <br />
                    have to join in consensus and �tune� our minds to allow for
                    <br />
                    communication.
                    <br />
                    We do this by learning and coexistence � and by the use of languages
                    <br />
                    (models). We are unable to know what �really goes on out there� by
                    <br />
                    direct
                    <br />
                    evidence. This is why we should prefer to choose monism since �out
                    <br />
                    there�
                    <br />
                    does not exist in a monistic science � all you know is experience.
                    <br />
                    And what
                    <br />
                    you cannot experience you cannot know � and neither speak of.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>What I am about to say today I'll probably regret tomorrow, but I've
                    <br />
                    been trying to &quot;experience the now&quot; and get beyond my dualistic
                    <br />
                    future-versus-past polarity. I don't expect popular support for my POV
                    <br />
                    �a naive biologist's POV�but it here goes anyway.
                    <br />
                <p>I wish I could learn enough about the natural laws of information to
                    <br />
                    overcome my suspicion that the brave field of ontology is a
                    <br />
                    philosophical excuse for worshiping the sainted &quot;being&quot;�the
                    <br />
                    penultimate expression of the Cartesian/Freudian stove-ego� the
                    <br />
                    &quot;experience&quot; experienced by intellectuals who can't see the forest
                    <br />
                    for the trees. I wonder if most ontologists are actually
                    <br />
                    romanticists at heart. Newton saw the forest, though, and he didn't
                    <br />
                    really need to have an experience with an apple, as the romantic
                    <br />
                    experientialists claim he did, to explain precisely how local gravity
                    <br />
                    works. There may be apples falling out of trees on Tralfamadore,
                    <br />
                    and, if so, they would fall with a force that can be described
                    <br />
                    universally as F = G(mm'/r^2), whether or not Newton or I actually
                    <br />
                    &quot;experience&quot; them falling. If this were not true then why do they
                    <br />
                    call it the &quot;universal law of gravitation&quot;? Doesn't science give us
                    <br />
                    an objectivity about reality that overcomes the subjectivity of a
                    <br />
                    &quot;personal-awareness experience&quot;? I think it trumps the need for a
                    <br />
                    personal MIndGod sitting on our shoulders. Newton's Law is not just
                    <br />
                    an experience of the mind; it happens all over the place, mind or non-
                    <br />
                    mind. That's why they call it a &quot;natural law,&quot; isn't it?
                    <br />
                <p>I'm sure, however, there are plenty of those who insist that the mind-
                    <br />
                    scape, which is the playground of science, is an ontological
                    <br />
                    problem. One might say in a parallel way that without a mirror you
                    <br />
                    cannot see your image, even though you know you have one; so then the
                    <br />
                    emphasis is disproportionately thrust upon the mirror. Are they
                    <br />
                    perhaps looking into a mirror and asking what the mirror would see if
                    <br />
                    they were not there looking into it? Is the problem of ontological
                    <br />
                    recursivity that confounding? My kind of dualism needs to
                    <br />
                    differentiate my perceived stove-ego experience from my learned
                    <br />
                    perspectives�I'll call it knowledge�of what nature is really all
                    <br />
                    about. When I do this I feel as though I am practicing science, and
                    <br />
                    my Occam's razor seems to want to trim off this excess bother over
                    <br />
                    the business of being a being and being properly imprisoned by the
                    <br />
                    Antropic Principle.
                    <br />
                <p>I've been fighting the experientialists�call them existentialists,
                    <br />
                    too, if you like�ever since Ram Das insisted that there is no
                    <br />
                    temporal reality, only the NOW, and that I need to give up my
                    <br />
                    shameful dualism to be one with the &quot;experience&quot; of it all. We even
                    <br />
                    had exercises for replacing invalid thoughts about reality with truer
                    <br />
                    feelings that must be &quot;experienced&quot; to be valid. You can't have a
                    <br />
                    REAL feeling, of course, because that might qualify as thinking,
                    <br />
                    perish the thought.
                    <br />
                <p>Have you examined the principles of ontology closely enough to
                    <br />
                    &quot;experience&quot; the recursive nature of &quot;being&quot; as something other than
                    <br />
                    a philosophical limitation? Once again, I don't see why science
                    <br />
                    doesn't buy us REAL objectivity as a way out of this ontological
                    <br />
                    dilemma.
                    <br />
                <p>Of course you will say that the human mind is the only true arbiter
                    <br />
                    of information, all of which is experiential. To that I might reply
                    <br />
                    that genes�exactly digital in their non-experiential reality�
                    <br />
                    communicate all sorts of information, whether or not an ontologist is
                    <br />
                    there to experience them doing it.
                    <br />
                <p>I'll conclude my thoughts here, knowing full well that my &quot;knowing&quot;
                    <br />
                    is not the kind of knowing that Arne et al. would qualify as true
                    <br />
                    knowing, since I don't always need to have an ontological experience
                    <br />
                    to appreciate my kind of reality. In my kind of reality, genes send
                    <br />
                    and receive information without the need for an ontological
                    <br />
                    principle. And science, to me, get us around that troublesome mirror
                    <br />
                    so we can actually see what's happening on the other side.
                    <br />
                <p>That's my $0.02 for the week. Thanks for your kind indulgence.
