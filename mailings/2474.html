                <p>Friends,
                    <br />
                <p>Thank you to Andrei for the solid beginning of
                    <br />
                    this session. If I understand it correctly, he is
                    <br />
                    using the platform of FIS (interest in the
                    <br />
                    fundamental nature of information AND how that
                    <br />
                    could lead to new perspectives in science) to
                    <br />
                    present some views on QI.
                    <br />
                <p>QI is usually a term applied to information in
                    <br />
                    the usual sense, processed or manipulated in
                    <br />
                    artificially designed systems using QM effects
                    <br />
                    and behavior, and that is how the introduction
                    <br />
                    begins.
                    <br />
                <p>Then the shift is made here: &quot;Therefore 'Quantum
                    <br />
                    Information' gives a new great chance for
                    <br />
                    reconsideration of quantum foundations.&quot; And we
                    <br />
                    are referred to a particular frequency view of
                    <br />
                    the Bell inequity wherein the EPR paradox is
                    <br />
                    resolved and QM is seen as a complete theory,
                    <br />
                    bolstering the notion that a useful view of
                    <br />
                    information can be distilled from it.
                    <br />
                <p>This view depends on Bellï¿½s (and others)
                    <br />
                    assertions against local reality.(Smith's half of
                    <br />
                    the introductory message wonders openly about
                    <br />
                    quantum communication and computation and
                    <br />
                    suggests that either QM is &quot;necessary&quot; or can be
                    <br />
                    replaced by classical &quot;tricks.&quot; He then asks
                    <br />
                    about the limits and nature of Q computation.)
                    <br />
                <p>Sri, in a side conversation, introduces the
                    <br />
                    notion of ontological precedence, which I would
                    <br />
                    like to extend beyond his notion a bit here.
                    <br />
                <p>Because I think our non-physicist colleagues may
                    <br />
                    get lost in all this, the relevant key concepts
                    <br />
                    here are due to Kolmogorov, a rather amazing
                    <br />
                    mathematician whose insights targeted the
                    <br />
                    mathematics of description and mapped discrete
                    <br />
                    probabilities onto topological spaces ordinarily
                    <br />
                    associated with logic. In so doing, he spanned
                    <br />
                    two traditions in mathematical philosophy:
                    <br />
                <p>One which is based in numbers and asserts that
                    <br />
                    science is a matter of measurement, and a second
                    <br />
                    tradition which asserts that science is a matter
                    <br />
                    of comprehending causality (causality in this
                    <br />
                    context being a matter of logical explication).
                    <br />
                <p>Classical physics broke when following the first
                    <br />
                    tradition and was fixed (still within that
                    <br />
                    tradition) by QM, which has proved to be
                    <br />
                    amazingly useful in physics, but not in other
                    <br />
                    sciences. That uncomfortable fact, plus some odd
                    <br />
                    QM paradoxes in physics, drive QM champions to
                    <br />
                    repair or extend QM by adding geometric features
                    <br />
                    from the &quot;second&quot; thread of mathematical
                    <br />
                    philosophy.
                    <br />
                <p>This had been done earlier in a simpler way in
                    <br />
                    the application of symmetry from what we'll call
                    <br />
                    the second tradition here. The result was of this
                    <br />
                    cross-tradition meld was the so-called &quot;standard
                    <br />
                    model.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>(Einstein, incidentally, was purely in the
                    <br />
                    geometric tradition, and there are still a number
                    <br />
                    of physicists, albeit shrinking, with similar
                    <br />
                    views. The international symmetry society ISIS-S
                    <br />
                    seems to collect a critical mass of these folks;
                    <br />
                    their next meeting is in Buenos Aires, November
                    <br />
                    2007.) Kolmogorov provided tools that went much
                    <br />
                    further in this synthetic vein of
                    <br />
                    cross-tradition, so is the basis of first resort
                    <br />
                    when coming to matters of QI.
                    <br />
                <p>So for the non-specialist in this area, the
                    <br />
                    challenge is to understand Kolmogorov's ideas. I
                    <br />
                    do not myself think it essential or even
                    <br />
                    important to recount the historical steps in
                    <br />
                    physics in this matter. What probably matters to
                    <br />
                    the reader is knowing where the levels of
                    <br />
                    abstraction are, in each of the instances where
                    <br />
                    one theoretical thread has been ï¿½fixedï¿½ using the
                    <br />
                    other. In other words, when the conceptual space
                    <br />
                    is reshuffled, which abstractions are then closer
                    <br />
                    to reality and which are at the other end of
                    <br />
                    elaborations, in the mechanics of representation.
                    <br />
                <p>I think the key is in tracing ontological
                    <br />
                    precedence, which would make this explicit.
                    <br />
                <p>Unhappily, working physicists donï¿½t normally make
                    <br />
                    these distinctions. If a theory works, it is
                    <br />
                    effectively collapsed into reality, regardless of
                    <br />
                    the internal dependencies of abstraction therein.
                    <br />
                    Worse, different theoretical formulations array
                    <br />
                    these dependencies contrarily depending on their
                    <br />
                    own foibles, academic political alliances and the
                    <br />
                    nature of the problem.
                    <br />
                <p>To my mind, information is a layered thing in any
                    <br />
                    formulation, and there is always a gradation
                    <br />
                    between the way things are and the machinery we
                    <br />
                    use to represent it. In fact, the way we chose to
                    <br />
                    represent phenomena could be thought of as a
                    <br />
                    second kind of information. It might even be that
                    <br />
                    the steps from reality to theory are discrete, or
                    <br />
                    appear to be so. In the case of theorists who
                    <br />
                    collapse representation into reality, these steps
                    <br />
                    are becoming tangled.
                    <br />
                <p>I suggest that if FIS really does come up with
                    <br />
                    something new and useful, it will be in inventing
                    <br />
                    or discovering these steps, or alternatively
                    <br />
                    proposing a new formulation of information
                    <br />
                    abstraction with specific steps. This way, when
                    <br />
                    we speak of information, at least we'll know what
                    <br />
                    type of information we are dealing with, before
                    <br />
                    we try to press into styles and forms.
                    <br />
                <p>Examples: ordinary, Copenhagen QM applies and
                    <br />
                    observer shift; gravitation field theorists
                    <br />
                    suggest hidden dimensions; information theorists
                    <br />
                    with a direct view insert Bell's &quot;hidden
                    <br />
                    variables&quot;; I expect Koichiro soon to suggest a
                    <br />
                    tense-based notion.
                    <br />
                <p>The proposal I am making here is to allow more
                    <br />
                    than one insertion level, and to provide for
                    <br />
                    different ontologies at each level, while also
                    <br />
                    allowing the ontologies to be linked in a
                    <br />
                    derivative way. This is not such a radical
                    <br />
                    proposal - if there is a gradation, then we
                    <br />
                    assume that the levels are linked. If there are
                    <br />
                    levels, we may find that different &quot;behaviors&quot;
                    <br />
                    characterize each stage, and that behavior must
                    <br />
                    be factored into any analysis of the information
                    <br />
                    we find there. And finally, because it is already
                    <br />
                    in the discussion, I propose that we use
                    <br />
                    Kolmogorov manifolds as a referent structure for
                    <br />
                    this.
                    <br />
                <p>Here's another way to look at it: whatever
                    <br />
                    &quot;language&quot; entities in the world use to
                    <br />
                    communicate with each other (and their enveloping
                    <br />
                    systems), it is ontologically unreachable to us.
                    <br />
                    It has an unachievably high Kolmogorov
                    <br />
                    complexity, meaning that the description is
                    <br />
                    bigger than the thing it describes.
                    <br />
                <p>So in keeping with the sensibilities of
                    <br />
                    physicists, the first ontological layer will
                    <br />
                    impose what we've called the &quot;first tradition&quot;
                    <br />
                    and reduce the complexity of the description.
                    <br />
                    What you have here is the view that many
                    <br />
                    physicists have of the world, a distributed
                    <br />
                    existence characterized as probabilities. Not
                    <br />
                    manageable information yet, not in the sense of
                    <br />
                    an FIS-like information science.
                    <br />
                <p>So we add another ontological transform that
                    <br />
                    further reduces the complexity, a layer that adds
                    <br />
                    logical ontological structure. This is
                    <br />
                    generalized from a notion of Levin's which deals
                    <br />
                    with one such ontological feature: constraints.
                    <br />
                    The result is topological manifolds with real
                    <br />
                    phenomenon on one fold and logical information
                    <br />
                    related to that phenomenon on another.
                    <br />
                <p>Any number of such ontological layers are
                    <br />
                    possible and I suppose as system scale increases
                    <br />
                    (physical, chemical, biological and so on...) new
                    <br />
                    ones are added, possibly with constant semantic
                    <br />
                    distance.
                    <br />
                <p>The point here is as stated at the beginning,
                    <br />
                    that &quot;ontological precedence&quot; is key in
                    <br />
                    unwrapping how QM and information inform each
                    <br />
                    other, if I can use such a reflexive notion.
                    <br />
                <p>Best, Ted
                    <br />
