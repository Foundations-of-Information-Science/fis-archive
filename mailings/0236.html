Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>Season's greetings to ALL!
<br />
<p>This is a belated response to the October posts of Wiliam S. Dockens and
<br />
Ted Goranson.  Becaause of the tardiness of this response, I am copying
<br />
the original messages below. 
<br />
<p>First, Prof. Dockens describes:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interfaces between psychology, anthropology, endocrinology, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pharmacology are crucial to a behavioral science approach to the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consiousness. Here, consciousness manifests itself from three perspectives:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Inside, looking out,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Outside, looking in and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Inside, looking in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
Prof. Dockens perspective is close to my own views, but, not restricted
<br />
to the nature of consciousness, but to causality in living systems. 
<br />
Thus, one can classify causality as: 
<br />
: bottom-up
<br />
: top-down
<br />
: inside-outward
<br />
: outside-inward.
<br />
<p>Such a classification allows for much more than layering; it allows for
<br />
a hierarchical logic of organization which includes scalar
<br />
relationships.  I think the bottom-up term is necessary to account for
<br />
energy flows and for biochemical processes.  Such biochemical processes
<br />
must underlie both pharmacolgy and endocrinology which are included in
<br />
the &quot;problems of consciousness.&quot; 
<br />
<p>Ted Goranson wrote: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You'll recall that we supposed that there are two kinds of information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Info (1) which is the ordinary kind, but which I wish in the present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;context to limit to kinds of abstractions and messages that support (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mechanics of) a science and Info(2) the impetus to organize. I submit that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;they are different and the challenge is to have them merge, which is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;likely possible in the social layer.
</em><br />
<p>The separation of info(1) and info(2) into these two descriptions is a
<br />
bit uncomfortable to a chemist.   Chemists believe that a fundamental
<br />
nature of atoms is that they attract to one-another in very specific
<br />
ways (manners, accomodations, associations, co-ordinations, ...). 
<br />
Molecules are organizations of atoms.  Biomacromolecules are
<br />
organizations of specific biomolecules.  
<br />
Within chemical thermodynamics, the &quot;impetus to organize&quot; is described
<br />
in terms of energy relationships; these phenomena underly the need for
<br />
nutritional sustainance of living systems.  Of course, more than
<br />
&quot;imputus&quot; is needed to form new biological organizaions; the specific
<br />
structures must be obtained from the ecoment (surroundings) or from
<br />
storage sources and reformed under the actions of the existing
<br />
organization.  Thus, it would be most interesting to learn how the
<br />
notions of &quot;info(1)&quot; and &quot;info(2)&quot; can be made inclusive with the
<br />
perspectives of chemistry and with the notions of causality as expressed
<br />
above.
<br />
<p>Ted Goranson further writes: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;3. The laws which codify these new abstraction spaces (and ideally the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mechanism which defines them) will be the most basic discoverable laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is to say that the mapping between info(1) and (2) will be not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;terms of information per se, but the definition of the abstraction spaces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;which define information. Since Category Theory is the mathematics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;abstraction, it may provide some useful formal techniques.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  
</em><br />
<p>I agree with the premise that abstraction spaces are necessary to
<br />
represent complex systems.  A basic question is: Are two abstraction
<br />
spaces sufficient?
<br />
Can we consider the term &quot;abstraction spaces&quot; to mean simply &quot;info(1)
<br />
and info(2)&quot; or analogously, microscopically and macroscopically (as in
<br />
Boltzmann)?
<br />
Rosen argues, from a categorical perspective, that Newtonianism is
<br />
insufficient.
<br />
(Boltzmann's equation is closely related to a Newtionian perspective.)  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From my perspective, I have argued that category theory can be used to
</em><br />
construct a hierarchy of &quot;abstraction spaces,&quot; but that these &quot;degrees
<br />
of organization&quot; (in my terminology) are linked in a manner different
<br />
from (info(1) and info(2). Rather, it is argued that degrees of
<br />
organization are composed as a sequence of metalanguages within the
<br />
&quot;imputus to organize&quot; generated by chemical thermodynamics.  Thus, the
<br />
number of &quot;degrees of organization&quot; is open-ended; the logic of the
<br />
grammers must be defined in terms of observations of natural systems.  
<br />
It is asserted that within a cell (or any living organism), the
<br />
&quot;imputus&quot; to organize can be classified into the set of directional
<br />
causes given above; proof of this assertion will not be easy. 
<br />
Obviously, genetics play a role in the &quot;inside-outward&quot; causal
<br />
processes.
<br />
<p>I am reluctant to comment on further aspects of Ted's post because the
<br />
meanings of the wider assertions are unclear to me.  Perhaps Ted would
<br />
find the time to ground his assertions within an explicit context space?
<br />
<p>And perhaps Prof. Dockens would find time to relate his hypothesis to
<br />
biochemical phenomena?
<br />
<p>Happy New Year to ALL!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a behavioral ecologist with a general systems approach, I have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; watching this conference with increasing interest. I enter here in response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Ted Goranson's move to &quot;jump-start&quot; the conference. Focus is on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspectives from which we view the problem of consciousness, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interdisciplinary interfaces where we formulate both the problems and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approaches to their solutions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interfaces between psychology, anthropology, endocrinology, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pharmacology are crucial to a behavioral science approach to the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consiousness. Here, consciousness manifests itself from three perspectives:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Inside, looking out,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Outside, looking in and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Inside, looking in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Inside looking out is basic because this is the first, and most immediate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way that individuals view the world. Effects of hormones and the inadequacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of language to describe these effects are two exceedingly difficult
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems from the &quot;inside, looking out perspective&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Outside, looking in, is the dominant approach of science and technology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematics and game theory, add power tools to scientific language.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless, consciousness has characteristics that frustrate most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventional mechanistic approaches. Mutual causality, non hierarchical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels, opponent processes organization and extremely complex positive and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negative feedback systems, all combine to produce a labyrinth of obstacles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a universally acceptable definition of &quot;information&quot;. Add to this the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; territorial imperatives that are the excess baggage of specialties, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sociology of science emerges as a significant factor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Inside, looking in is by far the most difficult perspective of the three.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self-reference plays havoc with conventional logical analysis. Identity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity functions lead to fuzzy boundaries that create nightmares for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classification systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Despite the obvious complexity that arises as a consequence of viewing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem from all three perspectives simultaneously, we can make progress.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, a division of labor, similar to the gnome project is necessary. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be careful not to confuse divisions of labor with divisions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature. I suggest we formulate our approaches in terms of functional units.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So that we can meet at the interfaces between disciplines and discuss the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables that describe, predict and control information.
