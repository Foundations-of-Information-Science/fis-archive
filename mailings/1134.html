Dear Soeren,
<br />
<p>We are getting closer, indeed.
<br />
<p><p>You formulate:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what this &quot;substance in which information is communication&quot; is and that
</em><br />
is the &quot;medium of communication&quot;.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me this is the field of meaning, and it is generated by the embodied
</em><br />
mind in living systems. Un-embodied systems like the computer can
<br />
therefore not really produced meaning that means anything to humans. i
<br />
claim that the biological and the psychological autopoietic systems
<br />
produce this substance of meaning that the socio-communicative system
<br />
then operates in and modulates!  What about that?
<br />
<p>My point is that social systems produce meaning, e.g. situational meaning
<br />
and codified meaning generated by scientific discourses, that can be
<br />
understood by humans. I would agree with you that it would be impossible to
<br />
understand this if the self-organization of pyschological systems were
<br />
completely closed (as in Maturana's model). However, language here comes in
<br />
as an evolutionary achievements which enables us to communicate both
<br />
information and meaning at the same time. The communicated meaning is again
<br />
appreciated at the receiving end by a human being, but s/he may attribute a
<br />
different meaning to it. What was a meaning exchange at one moment in time,
<br />
may be an information exchange at a next moment.
<br />
<p>If the self-organization of the social system were completely closed (this
<br />
is Luhmann's position), the social system would be able to generate its own
<br />
type of codification of the information (&quot;meaning&quot;), but we human being
<br />
would never be able to know this as a participant. We would only be able to
<br />
study society as another ecology. (This is Habermas's point against
<br />
Luhmann!) However, we are (im)perfectly able to understand socially
<br />
generated meaning, that is meaning as a result of interaction and
<br />
communication. Scientific discourses are the example par excellence: they
<br />
purify previous meaning by changing the meaning beyond the control of
<br />
individual contributions. Thus, meaning is generated at the supra-individual
<br />
level and understood at the individual level to a variable degree. The
<br />
distribution of the understanding then provides us with a first (not yet
<br />
reflected) concept of meaning at the social (that is, distributed) level. It
<br />
provides the substance of this communication of meaning because meaning can
<br />
be redistributed at this level.
<br />
<p>Because codification is recursive, the non-linear dynamics of meaning
<br />
processing change the one-dimensional communication of information
<br />
(input-output). For example, scientific knowledge can be further developed
<br />
and be solidified in science-based technologies and innovation which change
<br />
our realities behind our back. In other words, the dynamics of the system
<br />
may change from agent-based to communication-based and then also
<br />
knowledge-based. The crucial variable is the progression of the codification
<br />
of the information in more than a single dimension.
<br />
<p>The above should not be read as a fact, but as an expectation. However,
<br />
entertaining this hypothesis enriches the heuristics in the sociological
<br />
research design. (Let me stop here and not further explain this claim.)
<br />
<p>With kind regards,
<br />
<p><p>Loet
