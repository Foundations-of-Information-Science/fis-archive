**You may disseminate widely - with apologies for duplication **
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br />
In my view the notion of SYSTEM is something intrinsic to the kind of 
<br />
mind that the members of our species, comprised their immediate 
<br />
ancestors, managed to create and build without knowing in advance 
<br />
what they would achieve. I dare to assume that such a concept is what 
<br />
has always allowed every human to notice how he or she may or should 
<br />
deal better with everyone of his or her concerns, comprised the cases 
<br />
when he or she aims at disrupting or breaking or destroying something 
<br />
that had become a field or object that in her or his view should not 
<br />
exist.
<br />
<p>However, quite probably along many millennia every one of our 
<br />
ancestors during his or her nomadic life did not distinguish right 
<br />
away neither well enough what might be their concerns, being excepted 
<br />
the assumption that he or she was increasingly interested in 
<br />
surviving as best as possible till the following instant. In those 
<br />
years every individual usually had only a very short time available 
<br />
for reacting spontaneously when facing the various difficult 
<br />
circumstances that were unexpectedly arising continuously in the 
<br />
immediate surroundings.
<br />
<p>Therefore it could be argued that our ancestors hominids, who were 
<br />
practically engaged in organizing almost exclusively their daily 
<br />
survival, could - only very slowly - learn firstly to identify well 
<br />
and secondly to recognize better and better the questions that would 
<br />
allow them to carry out successfully those tasks conceived for 
<br />
determining what could be interesting for them, apart of taking care 
<br />
of their immediate survival.
<br />
<p>Consequently I dare to believe that suddenly, as soon as every human 
<br />
being could start organizing his or her personal life in the domain 
<br />
of one or another of the settlements constituted, it became possible 
<br />
for every individual to learn how to integrate gradually the 
<br />
knowledge of something else that had become in his or her mind an 
<br />
additional concern to deal with; In recent times such a knowledge has 
<br />
been singled out as the whole of the system &quot;de facto&quot; that has been 
<br />
identified in the mind of somebody.
<br />
<p>Along the twentieth century, since the concept of system was 
<br />
introduced quite successfully in the system community, most systems 
<br />
thinkers and cyberneticians search how to identify their concerns 
<br />
using the concept of system. Every systemist being: (1) necessarily 
<br />
conditioned by his or her perceptual possibilities and (2) under the 
<br />
influence of his or her biased interpretations of the reality, 
<br />
unavoidably apprehended peculiarly by every individual - therefore 
<br />
without being able to avoid the pressure of his or her own prejudices 
<br />
- almost always aims in practice at making sustainable the 
<br />
functionality of only some of the features that apparently 
<br />
characterized the civilized way of life.
<br />
<p>But today in the year 2002 it is clearly evident that the future 
<br />
panorama for humankind is already a tragic perspective for billions 
<br />
of people: the masses composed by human resources and the unemployed 
<br />
workers and their families who are trying to survive in miserably 
<br />
conditions because quite efficient systems are organized and 
<br />
maintained in operation for increasing the gap between wealthy 
<br />
fellows and the poor masses, for making more effective the unilateral 
<br />
exploitation of natural resources everywhere,...
<br />
<p>We might wonder why usually most scientists, practitioners and 
<br />
educators who use this concept do not care in learning that the so 
<br />
called Systems Science has been integrated de facto by three 
<br />
contradictory and conflicting interpretations of Systems Thinking:
<br />
<p>1. the Analytical Stream, which has evolved as Systems Engineering 
<br />
and Systems Management
<br />
<p>2. the Technocratic Stream, which is essentially concerned with 
<br />
Technological Cybernetics,  Information and Communication Technology 
<br />
Artificial Intelligence, etc.
<br />
<p>3. the Holistic Stream, which is the Bertalanffy's Systems Thinking 
<br />
(BST) as the approach that may reveal the Gestalten properties that 
<br />
characterize the higher levels of organization, the so-called living 
<br />
systems.
<br />
<p>Therefore, from now onward what is urgently needed is the explicit 
<br />
evolvement of this (BST) as a
<br />
<p>Top Ë Down approach
<br />
<p>strictly necessary for learning to identify better and better the 
<br />
concerns of a human being increasingly aware of his and her role on 
<br />
Earth, it is
<br />
<p>The Systems Thinking globally engaged based on
<br />
ethical, ethological, biological and ecological criteria
<br />
<p>which has become indispensable
<br />
<p>for dealing with those tasks that
<br />
<p>may increase effectively
<br />
<p>the survival chances
<br />
<p>of Homo Sapiens Sapiens
<br />
<p>I. To create in every society  a New Image of Man and Woman that may 
<br />
propitiate the gradual integration of a very new HUMANELY minded 
<br />
Anthropology.
<br />
<p>II. To conceive a WAY FORWARD for humankind towards the Creation of a 
<br />
Sustainable Society.
<br />
<p>III. To generate a very new Entrepreneurial Spirit that may emerge 
<br />
from Business based on Bertalanffy's General Systems Weltanschauung
<br />
<p>IV. To organize Peace Research in order to widen the views of every 
<br />
human obliged to comprehend the dynamics of conflicts and 
<br />
aggressiveness in human minds and to find out how every human entity 
<br />
may cooperatively cope with them.
