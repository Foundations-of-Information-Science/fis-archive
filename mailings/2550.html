                <p>
                    Friends,
                    <br />
                <p>it is completely irrelevant whether there exists an &quot;outside&quot; or not. We cannot decide this
                    question, being inside our skulls, encapsulated.
                    <br />
                    What we can discuss, what kind of picture we make of this outside, the properties of which we cannot
                    really experience, being slaves of our sensory organs and of our brains prestructured properties.
                    <br />
                    So far, we all are in agreement (within this FIS discussion, in literature, among philosophers and
                    among common-sense people).
                    <br />
                    Now comes the clever thought:
                    <br />
                    It is not relevant how the REALITY we believe to be, what we can look at is our PICTURE OF the
                    reality. And here one may conclude that a PICTURE of reality is better suited to picture the unknown
                    with if it allows for some properties of the unknown to be pictured.
                    <br />
                    E.g.:
                    <br />
                    we see that Newton has PREDICTED places,
                    <br />
                    that the concept of inertia is basically a concept of PREDICTIONS,
                    <br />
                    that the layers of electron start off at 2i**2,
                    <br />
                    that genetic info transfer translates from a sequence to a commutative assembly and back,
                    <br />
                    that genetic info transfer uses 3*4 vs. 64 logical units,
                    <br />
                    and so forth, each of these properties of the unknown needing a way (method) to be PICTURED.
                    <br />
                <p>Whether the picture will in fact, indeed, really picture Nature or not we cannot decide, because we
                    do not know how Nature in fact, indeed, really is. What we can say is that if we make the picture to
                    be accomodating to the idea of PREDICTIONS, we shall be able to explain more. Maybe this explanation
                    will be overturned later by an even better explanation, but today we have to choose between
                    explanational systems where:
                    <br />
                    heretofore was:
                    <br />
                    objects incorporate forces, forces emanate from objects,
                    <br />
                    is now:
                    <br />
                    no forces inhabit any dead objects, objects have no forces,
                    <br />
                    but their properties can be PREDICTED.
                    <br />
                <p>Heretofore was:
                    <br />
                    in a logical-mathematical picture, no contradictions and no inexactitudes exist, the two sides of an
                    &quot;=&quot; are really equal;
                    <br />
                    is now:
                    <br />
                    the two sides of an &quot;=&quot; are not quite equal, there is a slight, statistical inequality (to
                    the tune of about 10E-95%), in our counting system we pretend an exactitude which we do not have.
                    Our wishes have influenced our thinking. We wish that we can define something that is apart to be in
                    one piece. We are too clever by half by DEFINING something instead of counting it.
                    <br />
                <p>Like dumb people who are too vain to recognise and admit their error many steps back (examples from
                    history, business, game theory, diplomacy, psychology, etc. abound), the scientific community has
                    also its own &quot;inertia&quot; (its behaviour is predictably unchanging) by insisting that it has
                    been defined like this.
                    <br />
                <p>My proposal (not the first and not the last time) is that we start being subjective and not pretend
                    we have complete understanding of how we build our picture of the world. Our wish to congratulate
                    ourselves that we have found a way to picture Nature consistently and easily understandably appears
                    to be more rewarding than our wish to build a more complicated picture. The inner coherence is our
                    own urge, not a property of Nature.
                    <br />
                <p>So, let me repeat:
                    <br />
                    by using a too much simplified measuring-counting system, we keep using the ideas about Nature that
                    have been evolved by the Babylonians, Egyptians, Chinese, Greek and Arab, some 3-5 thousand years
                    ago. They lived in an experienced chaos and have built a measuring system with rigid rules, units,
                    results, grids.
                    <br />
                    We have much less anxiety about Nature, so we may allow a picture of Nature which is more
                    contradictory and complicated by its rules, units, results, grids, buit thereby allows recognising
                    Nature (or at leasrt our picture of it) as consistent and whole.
                    <br />
                    If we introduce two kinds of measurements, one based on similarity, rigid neighbourhoods and unique
                    results to operations, the other based on dissimilarity, varied neighbourhoods and most probable
                    resulty, and use the two systems in tandem, then we can make PREDICTIONS, and this is what we do as
                    we try to PREDICT Nature's next state, movement, behaviour.
                    <br />
                <p>We can do it, specifically in this chat room. There is sufficient intelligence in this room. Let us
                    hope there is alsso sufficient courage and common sense, too.
                    <br />
                <p>All the best:
                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear fisers,
                    </em><br />

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have been grading almost full time the last week, so I did not get
                        a

                        recent
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; posts on this topic. I will just make a short realist statement,
                        though.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is based on the Realism of C.S. Peirce. He distinguished between
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imaginary doubt and real doubt. Real doubt is that which gives us
                        evidence
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that appears to be contrary to our beliefs. Imaginary doubt is based
                        on
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possbilities that we have no evidence for, but we believe are at
                        least
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible. The problem with imaginary doubt is that it is based on
                        abstract
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reasoning, void of ties to evidence by and large, and it is thus
                        very
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fallible.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here is what I think:
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I just don't think that we can base epistemology on some consensual
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agreement about there being an external world, or about some world
                        we have
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; socially constructed. I think that we can know the world in terms of
                        its
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; features, and that we know many features of the world. I think that
                        the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world is an information structure along the lines of a distributed
                        system
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the line of Barwise and Seligman. The logic of such systems is
                        that we
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot infer backwards to the source in general. We need a special
                        sort of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; channel to do that. However, science and evolution tend to make such
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; channels. Obviously I would have to get into more detail. Of course
                        this
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all assumes there is something &quot;out there&quot;. My best
                        evidence for that is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there are things I do not create in my mind. Perhaps they come
                        from
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other parts of my mind, but that is still &quot;out there&quot;
                        relative to my
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness. Basically, I think that the evidence that there is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something &quot;out there&quot; is very strong, and the evidence
                        that there is not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is negligible. That we can't know the &quot;out there&quot; is based
                        on a huge
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; string of inference about the possibility of error in special cases
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; extended to the possibility for all cases. I reject the last part of
                        the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument. I don't think it is possible that everything we believe
                        about
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the external world is false. My argument again is fairly simple:
                        whatever
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the structure of the information that we experience, that which we
                        don't
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciously cause comes from &quot;out there&quot;, so we know
                        &quot;out there&quot; has at
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; least that much structure. And from there we bootstrap. Part of what
                        we
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bootstrap to is a consensual world (though I am constantly surprised
                        that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my neighbours see so little of what I see, so I am not sure how much
                        is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consensual -- I find myself often faking that the world is more like
                        what
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; people around me seem to think it is like -- this dishonesty bugs
                        me, but
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it saves fights over things like Zulus are much more like
                        Scots-Canadians
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than they are different from each other -- if I have a Zulu student
                        who
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wants to think that Zulus are fundamentally different, then I
                        usually let
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it go.)
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I see no need of any consensual proof of such an abstract entity as
                        a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consensually agreed on world in order to have knowledge of an
                        external
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world, nor do I see that the proof would be very convincing compared
                        to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; direct experience of things I do not cause myself, and which can
                        surprise
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me. I think that the evidence for a consensual world must be weaker
                        than
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the evidence for a world beyond our conscious experience, and any
                        argument
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in favour of doubting that world must have even weaker evidence.
                        Lacking
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such evidence, I doubt when I am surprised, and have a reason to
                        doubt.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Otherwise, I think both sceptical arguments and anti-realist
                        arguments are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all very fallible abstract thinking, which I don't much trust.

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understanding of the world out of materials from both our mind and
