<p>
Dear Sergio and All,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the many ideas packaged in your message. Let me start with a 
<br />
brief return to the disagreements.
<br />
<p>Am affraid that in my comments two weeks ago about your sentence, the 
<br />
'hard-core reductionism' expression was rather inappropriate --too trite 
<br />
and contentious. And maybe in your recent exegesis on my comments there was 
<br />
inappropriate wording too, as I clearly separated in my text your own 
<br />
sentence -- with quotations and italics-- from my own inferences about it 
<br />
(as Alicia said in Wonderland: &quot;I do not mean that you mean what I mean&quot;). 
<br />
Anyhow, enough of the trivial.
<br />
<p>Let me discuss again the the relative presence of absence (the 'weigh') of 
<br />
the Second Law in the dynamics of living beings. It is for me a very 
<br />
important subject, rather obscured even by illustrious authors of the field 
<br />
of physics (and of thermodynamics: Shu-Kun has written some clear sentences 
<br />
about that). Here, rather than arguing from sweeping statements  --in favor 
<br />
or against--- I would like to enter a few specific ideas from the 
<br />
scientific discipline in charge of the energetic analysis of the living: 
<br />
bioenergetics.
<br />
<p>Initially, most of living matter is composed by polymers of enormous 
<br />
lenght, thermodynamically pretty unusual, for all of those reactions imply 
<br />
an entropy decrease.  Who pays for that evident entropy decrease? It is 
<br />
enthalpy, the other player in the Gibbs free energy of almost every 
<br />
biological reaction--bigger, far bigger quantitatively, around one order of 
<br />
magnitude, or even two in most reactions within the living. The famous DNA 
<br />
polymer, for instance, repeating a eloquent saying by GR Desiraju (2003) is 
<br />
but &quot; a manifestation of mutual recognition, a storage device for 
<br />
structural information, and a victory of enthalpy over entropy&quot;.
<br />
<p>In enzymes, the influence of entropy in their overall efficiency is 
<br />
extremely low --they fantastically decouple information and energy 
<br />
processes, and they do so by becoming extremely good players with the 
<br />
enthalpy processes (always evitating the conversion to heat). Up to the 
<br />
point that, for instance, the whole cost of our brain processing operations 
<br />
is in the order of 10 watts. Almost of all of the energy transformations 
<br />
occur throughout the enthalpic path, scaping from the thermalization 
<br />
inherent to the change of entropy --it is crucial working always at room 
<br />
temperature, opposite of our engines, until now, for socially what we try 
<br />
to do now with the 'fuel cells' is but an imitation of biological metabolism.
<br />
<p>One of the consequences of the energy-information decoupling is the almost 
<br />
arbitrary complexity of the circuits of the latter --in types, forms, 
<br />
relative magnitude, connections, etc. By this extra informational 
<br />
complexity, the biological type of extremely efficient use of 'resources' 
<br />
may escalate up to 99.999 % (e.g., in key mitoch. respiratory chain 
<br />
reactions). This is only possible because there is the previous enormous 
<br />
accumulation of information classes both in the sequence of DNA and in the 
<br />
dynamic processes of the enzymic agents and the numerous concentration 
<br />
gradients around. Without that information, and without genes and ad hoc 
<br />
machinery, there is no detection of the necessary resources, no efficient 
<br />
transportation and inner transformation, no exchange of metabolic 
<br />
processing functions with other cellular types, etc.
<br />
<p>Even more interesting is the theme of enzyme degradation. Actually, it does 
<br />
not exist 'per se', rather it is a sophisticate mechanism of chopping 
<br />
away  the unnecessary enzymes and proteins (idle ones, or misfolded, or 
<br />
oxidized ones) and reconverting them to their original amino acid 
<br />
constituents, isolated. Then, these amino acids are used again and again to 
<br />
produce new proteins, i.e., other types better suited to the immediate 
<br />
metabolic circumstances of the cell. Perhaps this is a big lesson for our 
<br />
linear industrial system of products and wastes --and that lesson could be 
<br />
prolonged up to the many strands of biological wisdom that converge on 
<br />
GAIA. The planetary wisdom exists by means of a myriad of co-adapted 
<br />
genomes &amp; intracellular &amp; intercelluar info labyrinths.
<br />
<p>In my opinion, the information provided by science and technology for our 
<br />
societies, is not far away from what is done in such a complex way around 
<br />
the cellular genomes. Then, I think that Loet is quite right when he 
<br />
concludes that &quot;there is no alternative to knowledge-based innovations.&quot; So 
<br />
to speak, in our own societies Information and Resources become equal 
<br />
partners too, indeed mutual pre-requisites of each other: without knowledge 
<br />
and techniques we could not even talk about such resources --would coal, or 
<br />
oil, or the nuclear be a 'resource' without the appropriate know-how? 
<br />
Irrespective of their immediate environmental wealth, 'clever' societies 
<br />
have always found resources --and will keep finding them quite probably, 
<br />
provided an overall wisdom guides them.
<br />
<p>Implicitly, I was recognizing that, for good or for bad, science is not 
<br />
alone and does not cover the whole spectrum of human life and human 
<br />
knowledge. It is a robust  but, in actuality, a very modest player that far 
<br />
from been situated 'on top' is 'on tap' ... The many (and factually 
<br />
incommensurable) dimensions of the social body: cultural, political, moral, 
<br />
religious, nationalistic, racial, esthetic, hedonistic, etc., steer our 
<br />
global trajectory in very strange ways--irrational ones quite often. And 
<br />
for us, scientists, it is quite difficult to convey our messages beyond our 
<br />
narrow disciplinary bounds and to be heard. Actually society listen to us 
<br />
as a cacophony of little voices.
<br />
<p>In this aspect I think we need the mutual tuning up, as much as possible, 
<br />
of our disciplinary messages to society, and a continuous adaptation of our 
<br />
paradigms to the changing intellectual circumstances --as Enzo put. These 
<br />
days maybe I have exaggerated the critical part in my comments on the 
<br />
second law (another poor expression, thanks Sergio, was my &quot;putting the 
<br />
tool on the altar&quot;). But I might have a grain of truth in my freshman 
<br />
vision of the current clash between neoclassic and ecological econometrics. 
<br />
Ecological economics and information science might have 
<br />
important  goals  in common, and somehow we should get along concerning 
<br />
some particular discussions in the future, I think. (The informational 
<br />
theory of value is for me sort of a 'pot of gold' relatively close by).
<br />
<p>Well, given that we will close the session at the end of next Monday, this 
<br />
is my final posting in the session. My personal thanks to all of our 
<br />
ecological economics invitees who have contributed so informatively: 
<br />
Sergio, Enzo, Pavel, Edgar, and particularly to our elegant chairs Jerry 
<br />
and Luis.
<br />
<p>best wishes--season greetings.
<br />
<p>Pedro
