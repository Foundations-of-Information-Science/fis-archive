<p>
Pedro, 
<br />
<p>You commented:
<br />
<p>&lt;One possible referent to consider about abduction, besides the 
<br />
&lt;philosophical conceptualizations, might be the social realm.
<br />
&lt;It would be very interesting that we could manage to establish a family 
<br />
&lt;resemblance between the different approaches to abduction --philosophical, 
<br />
&lt;biological, social...
<br />
<p>Since the provenance of the modern concept of abduction is often ascribed to 
<br />
C S Pierce's pragmatism it would be interesting to hear from Soren or Edwina 
<br />
on this one (Edwina has just done that succinctly linking philosophical abduction
<br />
to 'new interactions' between minor premisses with the sign system).
<br />
<p>We probably need to clarify the different domain definitions a bit.
<br />
<p>In the medical field abduction (movement of a limb away from the median 
<br />
plane of the body) has a counterpart in adduction (towards the body). 
<br />
<p>How is that connected to the philosophical concept?
<br />
<p>Pedro, I was interested whether 'adduction' also operates at the cell level -
<br />
possibly more likely than induction and deduction &lt;:)
<br />
<p>In philosophy, abduction (from 'apagoge' rather than 'abducere') is arguing 
<br />
from a minor premiss where the major premiss is given. Adduction/abduction
<br />
represents a movement between adducing best evidence (citation) and the experiential
<br />
mapping from an accepted 'body' of knowledge (heuristics, instructions etc).
<br />
The Oslerian medical model, for example, has operated under this paradigm.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The classical movement of induction/deduction (between the general and the particular) 
<br />
operates in the background of the abductive process. According to sociologists 
<br />
like Berger and Lukacs abduction (without the dynamic coherence of a rational
<br />
dialectic) can lead to 'reification' and its converse anthropomorphism (where IMHO McLuhan was 
<br />
heading by mechanicising the 'message'). If you accept the 'triadic sign' framework
<br />
of semiosis you can avoid that dilemma (just as accepting the doctrine of the
<br />
trinity solves the odd theological paradox) but that doesn't cater for the
<br />
more pentecostal (Batesonian) view of abduction:
<br />
<p>&quot;All thought would be totally impossible in a universe in which abduction was not expectable.
<br />
.. I am concerned with changes in basic epistemology, character, self, and so on. 
<br />
Any change in our epistemology will involve shifting our whole system of abductions. 
<br />
We must pass through the threat of that chaos where thought becomes impossible.&quot; 
<br />
Gregory Bateson (Mind and Nature)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<a href="../../www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html">http://www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html</a>
<br />
<p>At this point we probably need a tag wrestling match between Bateson and Pierce
<br />
and their supporters... 
<br />
<p>With respect to 'media' clearly the Internet is a marvellous playground for abductive thinking
<br />
since major premisses are rarely challenged as we bounce between minor premisses as
<br />
we are doing right now! The Web has no Top Gun. The game is largely in the searching and mapping of received notions - an intellectual trash and treasure hunt in which the truth is 'out there somewhere' (Pedro's 'multiple 'bubbles' with almost nothing but a referent to an outside, patchy framework' like the hyperlink above).
<br />
<p>The third meaning of 'abduction' (seduction, kidnapping, UFO's etc) which
<br />
dominates the media may not be unrelated to the other senses (or even
<br />
to James Barham's idea of 'fooling interaction' in an informational process).
<br />
Maybe Rafael's concept of 'angelia' (Botschaft or intercessionary communication)
<br />
could link this in rather nicely while avoiding the Scylla of Shannon/Miller
<br />
communication theory and the Charybdis of McLuhanism. 
<br />
<p>John C may be right in thinking that following 'abduction' may abduce us further 
<br />
down the garden path but it might be an enjoyable and significant stroll.

<p>I would love hearing further thoughts from you two, and any interested 
<br />
party, about these different approaches to (philosophical?) abduction. In 
<br />
my own excursions onto biological (cellular) abduction I have always 
<br />
stumbled on the conceptual-cluster problem: the parallel need to articulate 
<br />
coherently several impossible concepts (function, life cycle, knowledge, 
<br />
symmetry-breaking, functional void...). I wonder whether, philosophically, 
<br />
something similar occurs.
<br />
<p>One possible referent to consider about abduction, besides the 
<br />
philosophical conceptualizations, might be the social realm. I mean, what 
<br />
is the 'info' mission of our means of communication? How do media fabricate 
<br />
'news'? Actually, the doings and workings of the famous 'media' of our 
<br />
societies, that we take for granted, were brought to the attention of 
<br />
scholars by Marshall McLuhan. In spite of the rather unfavorable view that 
<br />
most social scientists nowadays have on his work, I believe that he was 
<br />
very fertile. Particularly, in some parts of his analysis the 'abduction' 
<br />
idea looms. His slogan the 'media is the message' somehow suggests about 
<br />
the 'voidness' landscape that accompanies the media abduction of 
<br />
news...  multiple 'bubbles' with almost nothing but a referent to an 
<br />
outside, patchy framework. (But probably this is too biased an 
<br />
interpretation of mine).
<br />
<p>It would be very interesting that we could manage to establish a family 
<br />
resemblance between the different approaches to abduction --philosophical, 
<br />
biological, social...
<br />
