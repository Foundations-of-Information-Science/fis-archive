                    Replying to LOET, who said:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear colleagues, I agree with most of what is said, but it does not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;apply to social systems because these -- and to a lesser extent also
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;psychological ones -- operate differently from the hierarchical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;formations that are generated &quot;naturally&quot;. That is why we oppose
                        &quot;nature&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to &quot;culture&quot; in the semantics: cultural (and social) systems
                        enable us to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;model the systems under study and this changes the hierarchical order. I
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand that Maturana et al. argue that the next-order systems always
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;model the lower-order ones, but then the word &quot;model&quot; is used
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;metaphorically. The model (e.g., the biological) model enables us to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconstruct the system(s) under study to such an extent that we are able
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to intervene in these systems, e.g. by using a technology. This inverts
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the hierarchy. Thus, let me write in Stan's notation: biological
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;{psychological {social}} -- or is this precisely the opposite order, Stan?
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: The hierarchy is not &quot;inverted&quot;. {psychological {social}}
                    states
                    <br />
                    both that the social realm arises out of, and is a refinement of, the
                    <br />
                    psychological, AND that the social regulates/ interprets/ controls/
                    <br />
                    contextualizes the psychological. It is likely that there are opposing
                    <br />
                    opinions on this relationship, as some might have it be reversed. This
                    <br />
                    decision rides on the question of whether psychology existed prior to
                    <br />
                    sociality in the biological realm. And THAT depends upon definitions of
                    <br />
                    sociality. I myself weakly favor the way Loet put it -- {biological
                    <br />
                    {psychological {social}}}, but I could likely be persuaded to acccept
                    <br />
                    instead {biological {social {psychological}}}.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- then our scientific models enable us to change nature, for example,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;by building dykes like in Holland and thus we get: {social {biological}
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;since the ecological changes can also be planned in advance.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: This is in line with the standard view that the social realm is
                    <br />
                    higher than the biological, and regulates/ interprets/ controls/
                    <br />
                    contextualizes the biological, AND the lower levels down to the physical as
                    <br />
                    well. The relations, {physical constraints (material/chemical constraints
                    <br />
                    {biological constraints {sociocultural constraints}}}}, are transitive from
                    <br />
                    the higher levels. Loet's example is not significantly different from
                    <br />
                    beavers making a dam to create a pond. Note that this applies only to
                    <br />
                    those aspects of lower integrative levels that come under the purvue of a
                    <br />
                    particular social system.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;While lower-order systems are able to entertain a model of the next-lower
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;ones -- and even have to entertain a model -- human language enables us
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;not only to exchange these models, but also to study them and to further
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;codify them.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: I believe Loet is using &quot;lower-order&quot; here incorrectly
                    for the
                    <br />
                    specification hierarchy formalism, which is {lower order {higher order}}.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The further codification sharpens the knife with which we can cut into
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the lower-level ones. We are not constrained to the next-order lower
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;level, but we can freely move through the hierarchy and develop different
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;specialties accordingly (chemistry, biology, etc.).
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: This again is true of the specification hierarchy, which, as a
                    <br />
                    subsumptive hierarchy, is, as I say above, transitive from the higher
                    <br />
                    levels down.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Scientists are able to adjust the focus of the lense. This is a cultural
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;achievement which was generated naturally, but once in place also had the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility to distinguish between genesis and validity. No lower-level
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems can raise and begin to answer this question.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: I have no reason, based in the hierarchy, to disagree with this.
                    <br />
                    This is why we must erect a sociocultursal level in the hierarchy.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And doubling reality into a semantic domain that can operate relatively
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;independently of the underlying (represented) layer increases the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;complexity which can be absorbed with an order of magnitude. The issue
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;is heavily related to the issue of modernity as a specific form of social
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;organization. While tribes (&quot;small groups&quot;) can still be
                        considered using
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;natural&quot; metaphor, and high cultures were still organized
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;hierarchically (with the emperor or the pope at the top), modern social
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems set science &quot;free&quot; to pursue this reconstruction in a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;techno-economic evolution. &quot;All that is solid, will melt into
                        air&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Marx). Because of our biological body, we are part of nature, but our
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;minds are entrained in a cultural dynamics at the supra-individual level
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(&quot;culture&quot;) which feeds back and at some places is able
                        increasingly to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;invert the hierarchy.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: Again, true -- that is why we must erect a sociocultursal level in
                    <br />
                    the hierarchy!
                    <br />
                <p>Then STEVEN said:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I must disagree with the notion that there is any real separation of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature and culture. There are things that can be known that do not exist -
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a general category that includes culture - but culture does not stand
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;alone - it's right up there with irrational numbers and televisions.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The force of natural ethics (inevitable behaviors) is mediated by
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;convention and manifest in the behavior of individuals - culture is merely
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;one such convention.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: This depends upon what is meant by &quot;separation&quot;. In the
                    <br />
                    specification hierarchy the separation denoted by the { bracket allows a
                    <br />
                    kind of interpenetration. As I said above, it means both {A gives rise to
                    <br />
                    -&gt; {B}} and {{B} contextualizes -&gt; A}. But without marking these
                    <br />
                    boundaries we fail to note that there are different realms in Nature as we
                    <br />
                    have constructed it in our discourses.
                    <br />
                <p>Then PEDRO said:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the hierarchies debate, I would like to enter the role of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;big problem where the crucial info resides is in the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;forms-designs-assemblies, so that boundary conditions for every functional
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;set are properly established.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: Boundary conditions are set in any hierarchy by the higher levels
                    <br />
                    for the lower ones. That is why we can say that biology constrains
                    <br />
                    chemistry wherever it occurs.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The inner &quot;constraints&quot; also count, of course, but somehow are

                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: Yes, they function as material causes. Chemistry is a material
                    <br />
                    cause of biology, while biology imposes formal an final causes upon
                    <br />
                    chemistry.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This fact of not being able to introduce the boundary conditions in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;construct makes those hierarchical categorizations as empty, useless

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;conceptualizations ---brittle, rhetorical ones like those pompous Expert
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Systems of Artificial Intelligence (we all remind that fanfare during
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;early 80's).
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: But we are able to find the boundary conditions established by
                    <br />
                    higher levels in hierarchies. So, I can't see the problem. It may be that
                    <br />
                    hierarchical frameworks are not useful for all kinds of problems. I feely
                    <br />
                    admit it. The artificial intelligence folks, now oriented to seemingly
                    <br />
                    non-hierarchical 'agent based simulations' are becoming interested in
                    <br />
                    hierarchcal structures even now.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, the tremendously changing nature of the boundary conditions around
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;us, makes the severe dichotomies like nature-culture as artifacts. What a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;meal is? Depending on the context of the event, it is chemical,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;biophysical, mechanical, psychological, neurological, social,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;administrative, legal, cultural, fashionable... what aspect becomes more
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;relevant depends on the generativity of the occasion.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: True. And hierarchical analysis can be useful in some cases, as in:
                    <br />
                    {biophysical {chemical {mechanial {psychological {social}}}}} in the case
                    <br />
                    of a meal.
                    <br />
                <p>Then TED said:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;But we cannot of levels higher than us. So if there are higher levels of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;emergent structure beyond social systems - entirely possible and likely -
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;we couldn't understand it. I believe this is why the notion of a God or
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;gods is so persistent.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: Well, if we use definite formats, like subsumptive or
                    <br />
                    compositionbal hierarchical models, we can project certain properties
                    <br />
                    beause we understand the relations between levels in these models.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note in this, that a higher level of organization with its own emergent
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws is a quite different thing (the way I am talking here) than just
                        &quot;more
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure.&quot; So international peace, Gaia, or Stonier's internet-based
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;global brain&quot; are all within our current, social layer.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: I take it you are saying that we could not understand the
                    <br />
                    particulars of transations at the new level -- in the way that molecules
                    <br />
                    could not conceive of, say, 'gambling' or 'running'. Yes, that would be
                    <br />
                    the case. However, whatever these new relations might be, we could
                    <br />
                    understand that their results will impose boundary conditions upon our
                    <br />
                    existence, and that our activities will provide material causes for the
                    <br />
                    existence of that new level.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I cannot give you an example. But I think we can say some things about
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;it if we can suss out the steps associated with complexity breaking at
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;lower levels and extrapolate.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: We have been trying to generally understand emergence for some
                    <br />
                    time now. There are numerous models, but the issue is still open.
                    <br />
                <p>Then KOICHIRO said:
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; John Collier's distinction between &quot;restrict and enable&quot; in the
                        form
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of constraints reminds me once again of the remarks on boundary conditions
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;made by Michael Polanyi back in the sixties.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: I liked his usage that a higher level &quot;harnesses&quot; the
                    properties of
                    <br />
                    the lower levels to its interests (he was dealing with a speciication
                    <br />
                    hierarchy concept).
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This time, it came through Goedel's incompleteness theorem stating that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;both the decidability (either true or false, and not in between) and the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistency of the statements made in an arbitrary axiomatic system cannot
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;coexist. There should be a statement or a theorem which could be right but
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;not proved right within the given system. A negative aspect of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;incompleteness theorem is restrictive as literally respecting the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;axiomatic manipulation or algorithm, while its positive aspect is found in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;enabling as admitting a possibility that such an algorithmic computation
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;cannot stop. An explicitly positive form of the enabling aspect can be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;found in the occurrence of an inductive judgment.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: In hierarchy theory terms, the problem is solved by moving to a
                    <br />
                    higher level 'meta' discourse, which will make an interpretation that will
                    <br />
                    be both complete and consistent from that higher level perspective.
