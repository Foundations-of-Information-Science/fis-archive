Reply to Pedro Marijuan 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Pedro,
<br />
a). Bilogical information and QI. I really like your analogy between BI
<br />
and QI, especially remark on \&quot;some brief biological windows\&quot; in which
<br />
biological computing is possible. In the same way we have \&quot;some brief
<br />
quantum windows\&quot; in that quantum computing is possible. In April I had a
<br />
course of lectures at Institute of Physical Technologies of Russian
<br />
Academy of Sc. There is a strong group which works on quantum computers
<br />
with ion-registers. They pointed out to tremendous difficulty in
<br />
creation of long strings of ion-registers. Difficulties icreases
<br />
essentially nonlinear with increasing of the number of ions. Strings of
<br />
ions become very unstable. And \&quot;brief quantum windows\&quot; are too brief to
<br />
perform a quantum computational cycle. On the other hand, in QM such
<br />
composed systems are described very well by tensor products of Hilbert
<br />
spaces. During an informal conversation experimenters even presented
<br />
doubts that everything is okey with QM-description or at least our
<br />
understanding of it.
<br />
<p>b). Not so many quantum algorithms. There is some analogy with 
<br />
Analogous Computers. Such a physical divice is constructed for solution
<br />
of one of a restricted class of problems. Problems from teh
<br />
corresponding class can be solved essentially quicker than by digital
<br />
computers. An Analogous Computer works directly with physical
<br />
information without it digitalization. Are quantum computers special 
<br />
Analogous Computers? In some sense yes. Therefore it is not so
<br />
surprising that we can solve only very special problems. But of course,
<br />
such an analogy might be totally wrong.

<p>Reply to Michael Devereux: 
<br />
<p>a) Conference proceedings of Vaxjo conferences, see about these
<br />
conferences at <a href="../../www.vxu.se/msi/aktuellt/konferens/index.xml">http://www.vxu.se/msi/aktuellt/konferens/index.xml</a>
<br />
can be received without any charge if you send me Email, with subject
<br />
Proceedings and your post-address (except the last two years, since
<br />
American Institute of Physics started to publish the proceedings of our 
<br />
series of conferences).
<br />
<p>b). Interpretation of wave function.
<br />
Michael: \&quot;I&#x2019;m convinced that Born got the interpretation of the
<br />
wavefunction  correct. Quantum theory, as you emphasize, Andrei, is
<br />
fundamentally  about probability - the probable result of the next
<br />
measurement. One  mistake, and an almost ineradicable source of
<br />
confusion, is the misunderstanding that the wavefunction, Psi, can also
<br />
always be the  present state of the physical system. One can cite real
<br />
examples where both interpretations are not possibly valid
<br />
simultaneously.I&#x2019;ve traced the mistaken notion that Psi is always the
<br />
state of the system as far back as Bohm&#x2019;s book on quantum mechanics.
<br />
(Does anyone know an earlier source?) He certainly doesn&#x2019;t even attempt
<br />
a proof, merely citing some special cases.\&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Michael,
<br />
I agree with you that interpretation of wave function is the basic
<br />
problem of QM. The presence of numerous interpreation and the
<br />
impossibility to choose one of them (\&quot;to prove\&quot; that this one is correct
<br />
and all others are not) expresses the deepest crises in physics.
<br />
<p>\&quot;The wavefunction, Psi, can also always be the  present state of the
<br />
physical system.\&quot; -- This is nothing else than the conventional
<br />
Copenhagen interpretation of wave function -- Bohr and Heisenberg, von
<br />
Neumann, Pauli,... The story was very complicated. They chosen such an
<br />
interpretation not with the great pleasure. There was a lot of doubts. 
<br />
<p>Personally I completely agree with you. I do not think that the
<br />
Psi-function can be always considered as the state of e.g. individual
<br />
electron. For stationary states - yes, but nonstationary?
<br />
