Dear Pedro,<br><br>
Very good posting, I enjoyed it very much!!!<br><br>
Thank you very much for your &quot;elegant&quot; flowers!<br><br>
Luis<br><br>
<br>
================================<br>
At 16:00 19/12/2003 +0100, you wrote:<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>Dear Sergio and All,<br><br>
Thanks for the many ideas packaged in your message. Let me start with a
brief return to the disagreements.<br><br>
Am affraid that in my comments two weeks ago about your sentence, the
'hard-core reductionism' expression was rather inappropriate --too trite
and contentious. And maybe in your recent exegesis on my comments there
was inappropriate wording too, as I clearly separated in my text your own
sentence -- with quotations and italics-- from my own inferences about it
(as Alicia said in Wonderland: &quot;I do not mean that you mean what I
mean&quot;). Anyhow, enough of the trivial.<br><br>
Let me discuss again the the relative presence of absence (the 'weigh')
of the Second Law in the dynamics of living beings. It is for me a very
important subject, rather obscured even by illustrious authors of the
field of physics (and of thermodynamics: Shu-Kun has written some clear
sentences about that). Here, rather than arguing from sweeping
statements&nbsp; --in favor or against--- I would like to enter a few
specific ideas from the scientific discipline in charge of the energetic
analysis of the living: bioenergetics. <br><br>
Initially, most of living matter is composed by polymers of enormous
lenght, thermodynamically pretty unusual, for all of those reactions
imply an entropy decrease.&nbsp; Who pays for that evident entropy
decrease? It is <b>enthalpy</b>, the other player in the Gibbs free
energy of almost every biological reaction--bigger, far bigger
quantitatively, around one order of magnitude, or even two in most
reactions within the living. The famous DNA polymer, for instance,
repeating a eloquent saying by GR Desiraju (2003) is but &quot; a
manifestation of mutual recognition, a storage device for structural
information, and a victory of enthalpy over entropy&quot;. <br><br>
In enzymes, the influence of entropy in their overall efficiency is
extremely low --they fantastically decouple information and energy
processes, and they do so by becoming extremely good players with the
enthalpy processes (always evitating the conversion to heat). Up to the
point that, for instance, the whole cost of our brain processing
operations is in the order of 10 watts. Almost of all of the energy
transformations occur throughout the enthalpic path, scaping from the
thermalization inherent to the change of entropy --it is crucial working
always at room temperature, opposite of our engines, until now, for
socially what we try to do now with the 'fuel cells' is but an imitation
of biological metabolism.<br><br>
One of the consequences of the energy-information decoupling is the
almost arbitrary complexity of the circuits of the latter --in types,
forms, relative magnitude, connections, etc. By this extra informational
complexity, the biological type of extremely efficient use of 'resources'
may escalate up to 99.999 % (e.g., in key mitoch. respiratory chain
reactions). This is only possible because there is the previous enormous
accumulation of information classes both in the sequence of DNA and in
the dynamic processes of the enzymic agents and the numerous
concentration gradients around. Without that information, and without
genes and ad hoc machinery, there is no detection of the necessary
resources, no efficient transportation and inner transformation, no
exchange of metabolic processing functions with other cellular types,
etc.<br><br>
Even more interesting is the theme of enzyme degradation. Actually, it
does not exist 'per se', rather it is a sophisticate mechanism of
chopping away&nbsp; the unnecessary enzymes and proteins (idle ones, or
misfolded, or oxidized ones) and reconverting them to their original
amino acid constituents, isolated. Then, these amino acids are used again
and again to produce new proteins, i.e., other types better suited to the
immediate metabolic circumstances of the cell. Perhaps this is a big
lesson for our linear industrial system of products and wastes --and that
lesson could be prolonged up to the many strands of biological wisdom
that converge on GAIA. The planetary wisdom exists by means of a myriad
of co-adapted genomes &amp; intracellular &amp; intercelluar info
labyrinths.<br><br>
In my opinion, the information provided by science and technology for our
societies, is not far away from what is done in such a complex way around
the cellular genomes. Then, I think that Loet is quite right when he
concludes that &quot;there is no alternative to knowledge-based
innovations.&quot; So to speak, in our own societies Information and
Resources become equal partners too, indeed <b>mutual </b>pre-requisites
of each other: without knowledge and techniques we could not even talk
about such resources --would coal, or oil, or the nuclear be a 'resource'
without the appropriate know-how? Irrespective of their immediate
environmental wealth, 'clever' societies have always found resources
--and will keep finding them quite probably, provided an overall wisdom
guides them. <br><br>
Implicitly, I was recognizing that, for good or for bad, science is not
alone and does not cover the whole spectrum of human life and human
knowledge. It is a robust&nbsp; but, in actuality, a very modest player
that far from been situated <b>'on top' </b>is<b> 'on tap'</b> ... The
many (and factually incommensurable) dimensions of the social body:
cultural, political, moral, religious, nationalistic, racial, esthetic,
hedonistic, etc., steer our global trajectory in very strange
ways--irrational ones quite often. And for us, scientists, it is quite
difficult to convey our messages beyond our narrow disciplinary bounds
and to be heard. Actually society listen to us as a cacophony of little
voices.<br><br>
In this aspect I think we need the mutual tuning up, as much as possible,
of our disciplinary messages to society, and a continuous adaptation of
our paradigms to the changing intellectual circumstances --as Enzo put.
These days maybe I have exaggerated the critical part in my comments on
the second law (another poor expression, thanks Sergio, was my
&quot;putting the tool on the altar&quot;). But I might have a grain of
truth in my freshman vision of the current clash between neoclassic and
ecological econometrics. Ecological economics and information science
might have important&nbsp; goals&nbsp; in common, and somehow we should
get along concerning some particular discussions in the future, I think.
(The informational theory of value is for me sort of a 'pot of gold'
relatively close by).<br><br>
Well, given that we will close the session at the end of next Monday,
this is my final posting in the session. My personal thanks to all of our
ecological economics invitees who have contributed so informatively:
Sergio, Enzo, Pavel, Edgar, and particularly to our elegant chairs Jerry
and Luis. <br><br>
best wishes--season greetings.<br><br>
Pedro<br><br>
