<p>
This is a new topic, based on questions I have with Michael Leyton's work. This work was previously referred to by Ted Goranson. The focus of the research seems to be a search for innate principles of order - a very important, indeed vital, area. So- I'm interested in these principles of order.
<br />
<p>An example of an expression of innate order, understood as 'generals', is a figure in Michael Leyton's book (sorry, I don't have the title, just a few photocopied pages). I'll try to describe the figure (2.3; page 40). It is a figure of four parts: a, b, c, d and is intended to show a progressive 'recovery' of normative principles of order. The figure begins with a, and the subjects who view this (a) move to (d), recovering symmetry.  I hope this is an accurate description. Let me describe each part.
<br />
<p>(a) Given the axes x and y, you have what I term a 'tipsy parallelogram' situated on the plus side. Only one vertex is grounded at y-zero. The other vertex of the base of the parallelogram is a few points higher on y. So, it has 'one foot off the ground' and appears unstable.
<br />
<p>(b) The next image grounds the full base. Both angles become located at zero y axis.  So, we have a parallelogram that is grounded.
<br />
<p>(c) This next image is quite a change. It is a rectangle. The same area as the parallelogram, but - the parallel slants are gone.
<br />
<p>(d) The final image is a square, about 1/3 area size of the rectangle. The parallelogram has 'shrunk' in square area coverage.
<br />
<p>Now, to my understanding, this quadratic dynamics is understood as a natural cognitive process, viewing symmetry as basic and asymmetry as derived.
<br />
<p>Again- I might have interpreted the whole thesis very incorrectly, and hope that Michael Leyton will advise and correct me.
<br />
<p>My questions are:
<br />
<p>I agree with our universe's attempt to maintain symmetry. However, I think that our universe, after the BigBang, moved into a mode of symmetry production that I refer to as 'interpretive symmetry', which rests on networked relations. An interpretive symmetry is complex and doesn't have an original mode. That is, it cannot return to a holistic or 'pure form' symmetry. An interpretive symmetry is complex; there are numerous ways to 'be symmetrical', which is to say, to insert constraints against randomness. I wonder if the above four images refer to multiple ways of attaining symmetry?
<br />
<p>For example - I can certainly understand the rejection of an image of a 'tipsy parallelogram' standing on only one point, and the move to fully ground the base. I consider this an action of Gravity. Gravity is a mode of inducing symmetry. So, grounding the tipsy parallelogram moves us from image a to b.
<br />
<p>Then, image c, the switch from a parallelogram to a rectangle. I can understand this as also a result of gravity, for we have the base firmly attached to x-axis, and to keep the Form as a parellelogram would, like the leaning tower of Pisa, require structural repairs. But - we could maintain this leaning tower, and consider it 'symmetrical', within an interpretive symmetry that inserted that infrastructure. That is, moving the structure from a parallelogram to a rectangle is not the only way to insert symmetry. Does our universe permit multiple ways of enabling symmetry, or does it insist on only the most basic?
<br />
<p>The next image, d,  bothers me more. Here, the image becomes a small square, about one-third the size of the rectangle (the base remains the same length). This, to me, - is not a result of gravity. Or is it? Is a reduction of mass a result of gravity? Or is there another principle involved that leads me, the viewer, to 'naturally' change a rectangle to a square - and one with a smaller area?  Certainly, the square is more symmetrical, in form, than the rectangle.  This assumes that symmetry of form is a 'primitive' means of ensuring stability. I agree. We see that in crystals. But- is symmetry of form the only means of ensuring symmetry, or preservation of energy? Doesn't our universe have multiple modes - and these do not reduce to each other?
<br />
<p>I hope that this is not too complex a post, and that Michael Leyton can answer it. It is focused, I think, on the nature of symmetry and asymmetry, and the question of whether or not, our universe operates in multiple modes of symmetry-enforcement.
