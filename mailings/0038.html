Dear Pedro
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You write:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I cannot help but reiterating my present skepticism about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deepest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological considerations. When Cao and Aitchison (1997, Nature, 388,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 340) discuss, in the context of theoretical physics, about STRUCTURAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REALISM (I played by heart and partially failed with the term in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; message--thanks, Soeren), they hold that &quot;the structural relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities (often expressed by mathematical structure) in a succesful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be taken as real, rather than the entities themselves&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
It is one of the points that I would like to underline in my view -
<br />
based on Peirce - that the relations, processes and regularities
<br />
(thirdness) are just as real as particles and things. 
<br />
<p>Again - with Peirce- I think you have two choices about metaphysics:
<br />
Either you discuss it consciously or your are controlled by it
<br />
unconsciously. It is always there, but has been suppressed in the
<br />
sciences and most researchers are now unconscious mechanistic realists.
<br />
That is why it is necessary to discuss metaphysics again.
<br />
<p>You doubt that we know enough at this stage of research to get anywhere
<br />
with metaphysical discussions.
<br />
<p>I do not think that we can reach an agreement on a precise metaphysics,
<br />
but we might agree on that a few of them are not compatible with the
<br />
facts we have now or when somebody attempts to make a grand synthesis
<br />
-like Tom - there are some metaphysics that are not compatible with the
<br />
theory. That is anyway one of my problems with Tom's theory that it
<br />
seems to be raised on an implicit mechanistic foundation but actually
<br />
suggest a theory that is not compatible with this foundation, as far as
<br />
I understand him. Things like that really bothers me, and it takes the
<br />
beauty out of theories. So I would really like Tom - as the father of an
<br />
explicit grand theory - to try to clarify that here. Maybe my
<br />
understanding is wrong or maybe we could clear up some foundational
<br />
problems that would pave the way for further development. This is after
<br />
all FIS. 
<br />
<p>Finally you actually talk about &quot;language&quot; on other levels than human
<br />
social. In the pragmatic view language are organized in language games -
<br />
like the scientific one we are playing now. But to use the concept
<br />
language we usually demand a syntax, the ability to make meaningful
<br />
sentences and some generative principles to make new meaningful
<br />
sentences appear. With biosemiotics I think that what animals exchange -
<br />
and even what cells exchange - should be called signs. I have suggested
<br />
that we call the vocabulary of signs and the life forms or context
<br />
within which they work, instead of languages, for 'sign games'. This was
<br />
again epistemological and ontological aspects that were necessary to
<br />
make clear.
<br />
<p>In my opinion to work with FIS is to a great extend to try to make some
<br />
of these metaphysical assumptions clear enough to be discussed in a
<br />
fruitful way.
