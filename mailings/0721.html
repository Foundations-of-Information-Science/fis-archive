This is in reply to Pedro's comments:
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Edwina]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;As for the truth being rational, I believe that our world does operate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;logically rather than randomly. Certainly, randomness exists as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;well as freedom (not the same thing), but, overall, both freedom and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;logic interact in a 'logical' manner. And our perceptions must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;always be open to validation, or, rejected. I can continue to believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in a flat earth, but I must allow that belief to be open to proof.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
[Pedro] The fraction of living happenstances in 'our world' that can 
<br />
finally be put 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a formal, logical scheme is astonishingly small. Including the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sciences themselves (not to speak about the economy and our social life). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is the hard fact that for instance put into a modest scheme the Art. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intel. great hype of decades ago. Cellular and neuronal 'intelligence' are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; orders of magnitude above their artificial counterparts, based on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles and 'new maths' that we do not contemplate appropriately yet. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Logicism, in the way it is treated above, is not definitely the main engine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behind individual and social accumulation of knowledge. So, to put it a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couple of words: 'economy' versus 'entropy', without forgetting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'complexity' and 'elegance'.
</em><br />
<p>[Edwina]  No, I'll disagree. I don't think that our world is 'put into' a 
<br />
formal logical scheme. I think that it exists and operates, within 
<br />
itself, within a logical set of interactions. If not - matter could not 
<br />
interact with other matter except in randomness. That would result 
<br />
in a heat death of our universe. The fact that randomness is not the 
<br />
only agential force, is due to the reality of a 'logic of relations' within 
<br />
matter. I don't know what you mean by 'economy' versus 'entropy. I 
<br />
would think that both are required (ie, compression of information to 
<br />
generals and release of energy). Equally, your reference to 
<br />
complexity and elegance are unclear to me.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
[Pedro] 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reality of the external world in the context of science is a discussion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of its own (I recognize it has been postponed a couple of times here--some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day it  has to be treated). More than establishing a logical 'truth' the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem of life becomes capturing the 'relevance' of the different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognizing perspectives that can be applied into the context. One can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce endless logical statements about any occurrence --stumbling upon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the most relevant aspect of the occasion is the biggest problem, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usually we take for granted. In the context of the different sciences, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call it the 'interdisciplinary problem' --what of the multiple existing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bodies of knowledge would apply given the numerous surrounding constraints? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion it could be subsumed under the intricacies of the 'abduction' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptualization (thanks a lot to John C. for his posting with the abd. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff he checked about)
</em><br />
<p>[Edwina] I'm unclear about the above comments. One can produce 
<br />
endless anything - both logical statements and postmodern 
<br />
relativist statements. Abduction is the development of a new 
<br />
hypothesis for organizing interactions/relations with the world. It 
<br />
acts as a logic.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Pedro]
</em><br />
&nbsp;The most relevant piece of knowledge is, in this case, the new concoction 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of ecology and neurobiology that Allman and others have developed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (curiously, in parallel with the growing 'eco' impact upon the emerging 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution-development field --evo-devo). For Homo sapiens, the violence and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nurturing behavioral complexes are definitely well separated between the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sexes (it does not mean that they are not 'plastic' and can be relatively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molded by social life). The neuro and molecular stories underlying our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emotional and behavioral (eco) adaptive traits are just fascinating. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not the old sociobiological reductionism, it is great interdisciplinary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science, really sober and prudent (and perhaps, lacking the spice and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hot conflicting elements, it has not make an impact: 'salience' and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'relevance' do not always go hand with hand). Then, in what extent can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; social life counteract nature's propensity designs? I do not really know, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I have scholarly references about the contemporary rate of violent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crimes of men vs. women in Western countries: it is about an order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; magnitude (10 to 1).
</em><br />
<p>[Edwina] Strange. I have scholarly references about the rate of 
<br />
violence among men and women - and it's 50-50.  Not 10-1. But 50-
<br />
50. Two of us did a study of this a few years ago (published in the 
<br />
journal Sexuality and Culture), referring to violence among both 
<br />
men and women. Despite the feminist claims of 'men are violent' 
<br />
and 'women are nurturing', our data base showed 50-50. And it 
<br />
wasn't simply our own data but referred to other studies.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[ET] I disagree with the statement that 'information is knowledge-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;independent'. It is knowledge-dependent. What is going on, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universe, is an evolving 'knowledge' where bits of matter are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;'informemd' (set up into relations). These relations operate within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;logical interaction; they are not random or the matter would rapidly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;dissolve. The relations, as operative in the logic, are knowledge-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;dependent. But, this knowledge cannot be isolate. It cannot be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;self-asserted belief. It has to enable information 'bits' to emerge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that are validly operative in the real world.  Also, there is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;thing as a 'primary matter' in the sense that the emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;information is a copy of it (that's Platonic, and I'm not a Platonist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;There is primary energy which is formed, by logical relations, into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
[Pedro]  That´s quite a cosmological scheme. I am really curious 
<br />
on what physicists 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would say about it.
</em><br />
<p>[Edwina] Well, I work with a few physicists on these thoughts. Now 
<br />
I would never say that because some physicists like the scheme, 
<br />
then all physicists do or should. I'm only saying that my views are 
<br />
discussed with me, by physicists, who agree with the perspective. 
<br />
You can, of course, conclude that we are all living in our own cave.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To put an end to my comments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John H. is preparing the next batch of papers --Florido, Benking, Brier, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fuchs. Let us enjoy in anticipation, and let us start the readings...
