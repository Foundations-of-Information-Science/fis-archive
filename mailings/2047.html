                    Dear Aleks &amp; collegues
                    <br />
                <p>In my understanding, entropy is an illuminating concept at the level of
                    <br />
                    semi-closed systems like the earth, which is closed to material but open to
                    <br />
                    energy flows. Here the Second Law teaches us that there are limits to
                    <br />
                    material growth of economies, and as Bob remarked, these limits may come
                    <br />
                    from the overloaded sinks even before we have degraded the sources. This
                    <br />
                    issue has been long ignored by mainstream economists although the notion of
                    <br />
                    entropic processes has been introduced by Georgescu Roegen already in the
                    <br />
                    early seventies. When we come to microeconomic issues and economic networks
                    <br />
                    I see entropy as a rather rough conceptual tool.
                    <br />
                <p>Firms and networks may be
                    <br />
                    better described (in my opinion!) as autocatalytic systems (what follows is
                    <br />
                    based on ecological networks analysis of Bob Ulanowicz ). Suppose that a
                    <br />
                    firm is started at t=0 with one person and the resources of size R=1. If
                    <br />
                    the entrepreneur after, say, periods t=3 succeeds to increase the resource
                    <br />
                    size to R(t3)= 2, than there is propensity that he will reinvest part of the
                    <br />
                    resources to add an employee. As the firm gets bigger its potential to
                    <br />
                    dissipate energy/resources and increase internal organization grows, but
                    <br />
                    subject to some constraints that I will skip here. The constitutive elements
                    <br />
                    of the firm - its employees - exchange energy, resources and information in
                    <br />
                    the process of business activity. As members of the internal autocatalytic
                    <br />
                    loop of the firm they are subject to competition and selection processes (as
                    <br />
                    well as the firm is subject to these processes in its wider environment -
                    <br />
                    the market). Autocatalysis stimulate competition
                    <br />
                    and selection in the sense that it streamlines preferentially energy and
                    <br />
                    material flows towards more efficient members, be these already inside the
                    <br />
                    loop or act at its periphery as potential &quot;new entrants&quot;. In the competitive
                    <br />
                    process a new member who contributes more to the growth of the loop may
                    <br />
                    replace a less
                    <br />
                    efficient member. In that sense firm is autonomous of its microscopic
                    <br />
                    constitution: although individual members can be replaced
                    <br />
                    the loop itself may persist in time (the same is valid at the next
                    <br />
                    hierarchical level that of the market where firms enter and exit but the
                    <br />
                    industry persist over much longer period of time). It follows then, that
                    <br />
                    cooperative behavior is guaranteed or inscribed in the system - those
                    <br />
                    members of the firm which fail to cooperate (read, to contribute!) are most
                    <br />
                    likely to be expelled from the &quot;loop&quot; and replaced with a new entrant. This
                    <br />
                    is valid for also for the firms which are subject to selection process in
                    <br />
                    the economic network. The internal autocatalytic loop of the firm persists
                    <br />
                    only if the inflows of funds are equal or greater than outflows, and
                    <br />
                    therefore, as you mention, on the
                    <br />
                    average its employs will maintain or increase their energy (or the firm will
                    <br />
                    die out).
                    <br />
                    A single market (e.g.the automotive market) is a functional
                    <br />
                    network of interdependent firms, hich exchange energy, resources and
                    <br />
                    information, and
                    <br />
                    in concert with household demand operated as an autocatalytic system of its
                    <br />
                    own.
                    <br />
                    The economy is an ensemble of interrelated markets and total household
                    <br />
                    demand. As the economy gets bigger its autocatalytic loop drives in more
                    <br />
                    energy and
                    <br />
                    resources (the centripetal pull) and an ensemble of economies (e.g. G8) may
                    <br />
                    produce an autocatalytic loop at the international level (e.g. the period of
                    <br />
                    industrialization in Western Europe and its periphery 1870-1914) and the
                    <br />
                    more globalized loop after the II World War, including Japan the US etc.
                    <br />
                    When the global autocatalytic loop become large enough its effects are
                    <br />
                    necessarily felt on the whole biosphere (sources and sinks) and we come at
                    <br />
                    the beginning of our story. At this point the entropy analysis at the level
                    <br />
                    of the global system becomes wholly operative and illuminating.

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's focus on the level of a (possibly compound) system, composed of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; components, which are themselves composed from molecules. The energy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; posessed by the components is X, and the energy posessed by the molecules
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is Y. The total energy is X+Y, and this is interpreted as fixed in most
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; contexts of thermodynamics, but we interpret Y as entropy. The second law
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thermodynamics can be interpreted as saying that whatever you do,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules never take less than the components.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's take this to economics: the funds of a corporation are X, the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; funds of its employees are Y. In a zero-sum game, closed system,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; X+Y=constant. Whatever goes on, employees won't give their money to the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; corporation, but will happily take money from the corporation. This way,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can predict the dispersal of the corporation. HENCE, the corporation
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; can only exist when there is an inflow of funds from outside. This
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't mean that everyone in a corporation will happily disperse: there
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be sub-corporate entities that cut in the intermediate space between

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the corporation as a whole and an individual employee.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; The message is that when you have an emergent system, such as the body
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a corporation, it is built on simpler systems that are only involved

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; in cooperative behavior so that their own energy is maintained or
