                    Hi folks,<br><br>
                    I'll take a few minutes from my moving and dealing with academic
                    emergencies at UKZN to make a comment here.<br><br>
                    Jerry brings up a point that keeps arising in the literature one
                    constraints and information. Recall that Shannon said that they are the
                    same thing. That is a clue.<br><br>
                    Loet and I dealt with this issue previously on this list about a year ago
                    when he claimed that social communications channels open up new
                    possibilities (analogous to Jerry's position here), and I asked him why
                    this was so, since any further structure must reduce the possibilities,
                    not increase them. We each promoted out view for a while, and then
                    stopped, as it wasn't going anywhere. The reason is that there is nowhere
                    to go with this issue. Both positions are correct, and they do not
                    contradict each other; they are merely incompatible perspectives, much
                    like Cartesian versus polar coordinates. The positions are not logically
                    incompatible, but pragmatically incompatible, in that they cannot both be
                    adopted at the same time. This is a fairly common phenomenon in science.
                    In fact I wrote my dissertation on it. There is a paper of mine,
                    Pragmatic Incommensurability, in the Proceedings of the Philosophy of
                    Science Association 1984 (PSA 1984) that goes into the issue in more
                    detail, but not as much as in my thesis. I am kind of bored with the
                    issue at the issue at this point, but it keeps coming up, so I'll say a
                    bit more.<br><br>
                    Stan's bracket formulation is a logical restriction (constraint), with
                    the outer bracketed items logically restricting the inner ones. It is a
                    neat formulation for a system developed by W.E. Johnson in his book
                    Logic, in which he called the inner elements determinates and the outer
                    ones determinables. The idea is a basic one in the Philosophy business,
                    and these are the technical terms used there, although they are somewhat
                    awkward, being relative terms, and also not words used with their English
                    meaning. Jerry's problem is that if the chemical opens up a huge range of
                    possibilities not available to the physical, how can we call the physical
                    a constraint on the chemical. I once asked Stan a similar question, and
                    he gave me an answer that satisfied me enough not to pursue the issue.
                    The answer requires a distinction concerning constraints (which, recall,
                    is logically equivalent to information -- any connotative difference
                    being irrelevant to my point here). My colleagues and coauthors Wayne
                    Christensen and Cliff Hooker once referred to the difference between
                    restricting and enabling constraints. The former restrict possibilities,
                    while the latter are required in order to make things possible -- mush
                    produces nothing. But there is no essential difference -- context, if
                    anything, makes the difference. I say 'if anything' because in many cases
                    constraints (indistinguishable from information by logic alone) do both:
                    restrict and enable. There is no paradox here -- they are two sides of
                    the same coin. A Taoist like me sees them as Yin and Yang -- the Yang
                    element is the defined and restrictive, active, controlling part, while
                    the Yin is the open, receptive and enabling part. We cannot view the same
                    thing as both Yin and Yang at the same time (we can talk about it in the
                    abstract, in the same way that we can talk about Cartesian and polar
                    coordinates together, and even transform them on in to the other), but
                    the thing itself is both, and the transformations between Yin and Yang
                    have a logical form that is predictable and determinate. Just so with
                    restricting and enabling constraints -- we can learn to transform one
                    into the other, both in thought and in practice. <br><br>
                    I will now demonstrate this with Jerry's cases (though the ideas are
                    hardly peculiar to Jerry's cases)<br><br>

                            Genetic networks are not an amalgam of soft concepts, rather a genetic
                            network is a discrete interdependent network of chemical relations.<br>
                            The enumeration of the creative&nbsp; genetic network is complete for
                            some organisms, some species.<br><br>
                            In Aristotelian logical terms, the position of the species is between the
                            individual &quot;point&quot; and the &quot;genus&quot;.<br>
                            It is the chemical capacity to create species that I find to be absent

                    There is no difference between the two statements -- the scope in the
                    'from' case is the Yang side of things, but in the 'to' case it is the
                    Yin side. One pays attention to the Yang aspects, and the other to the
                    Yin aspects. Both propensities are there, and the stronger the Yang
                    propensity the more it transforms into the Yin, and vice versa. Given a
                    finite information capacity, these are the only two possible dynamics,
                    and they trade off against each other. Now, if we have an expanding
                    information capacity (phase space), as Kaufman, Brooks and Wiley, Layzer,
                    Landserg, Frautschi, Davies and other notables have seen, we can get both
                    together, though they still trade off one against the other. <br><br>

                    Jerry, I think the way this is worded is not quite consistent with the
                    perspective you are promoting. We don't &quot;select&quot; the meaning of
                    our symbols, except perhaps in fairly formal contexts. If we did it would
                    be very hard to be usefully creative, I am sure you agree -- we could
                    only select what we already have a template for -- see my Dealing with

                    But so do the constraints or restrictions, as Stan has been arguing for
                    years now. There is no inconsistency in both happening.<br><br>

                            to Stan: We have been discussing similar concepts since the inception of
                            WESS more than 20 years ago and it does not appear that we are
                            converging!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you
                            choose to embrace the creative capacities of chemical logic, I fear your
                            mind is doomed to the purgatory of unending chaotic cycles, searching for
                            a few elusive or perhaps imaginary &quot;fixed points.&quot;&nbsp;
                            ;-)&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-(

                    And there is no convergence. There are fixed points -- there have to be
                    or all we can have is mush -- but they are not where the action is. On
                    the other hand, the 'action' occurs only because of receptivity to&nbsp;
                    being worked on or guided by constraints that must relatively fixed. The
                    divergence is there in reality, and the place where there is convergence
                    is beyond our ability to grasp with an argument. I am sure that Stan
                    knows this.<br><br>
