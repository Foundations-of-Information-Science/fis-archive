Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>This email seeks to address topics of discussion during the past  
<br />
week.  In order to seek some sense of coherence to the on-going  
<br />
exchanges, I will attempt to frame the commentary in terms of the  
<br />
second question poised in the opening contribution.  I start with the  
<br />
concepts of the Nous and Aristotelian categories.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Historically, in the 1840’s, Kirchhoff’s theory of flow in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; electrical networks grounds the metaphor of the conceptual  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; framework for molecular bionetworks.  However, the relatively  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simplicity of the flow of electrons in comparison to the flow of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; life restricts the analogy severely.  Nevertheless, biomolecules  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are composed from electrical particles and certain electron flow  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; patterns are intrinsic to metabolic networks in living systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2. From the perspective of information, how is it possible that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bionetworks construct the informed flows of electrical current  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; flow and how is it related metabolic flows?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<p>Classical philosophy explored the classifications of relations among  
<br />
logic, ethics and &quot;physics&quot; (as a name for nature / medicine.).
<br />
<p>The Aristotelian categories served as the source of classification of  
<br />
substance (matter).  These categories addressed the issues of concern  
<br />
to modern experimentalist with ONE EXCEPTION.  In modern English, the  
<br />
interrogatories (who, what, when where, how and why) serve as a  
<br />
useful parallel to the Aristotelian categories.  The Aristotelian  
<br />
categories played a fundamental role in medieval education until the  
<br />
Newtonian path lead to the mystification of numbers (irrational  
<br />
numbers, transcendental numbers, surreal numbers) and the Kantian  
<br />
meltdown of rational philosophy.
<br />
<p>The categorization of the concept of Bionetworks  was not adequately  
<br />
addressed in my initial post but is important for the discussion that  
<br />
follows.  The notion of networks is closely related to the concept of  
<br />
logic trees.  The logical distinction between 'trees&quot; and 'networks'  
<br />
is not simple.  For our purposes here we will consider &quot;the tree of  
<br />
life&quot; as a logic tree, that is, a common root and sequences of  
<br />
bifrucations that separate the flows into distinct species.  Networks  
<br />
differ from trees by the inclusion of cycles.  (One may consider the  
<br />
cycles to be be either feedback or feed forward cycles that influence  
<br />
flows.  So, bionetworks include cyclic relations, cyclic categories,  
<br />
cyclic regulatory processes.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we speak of bionetworks we wish to include the following  
<br />
classes of networks, starting from simple and growing increasingly  
<br />
perplex:
<br />
1. the networks of chemical communications of simple cells that  
<br />
generate cellular functions and reproduction
<br />
2. the networks of chemical communications among the cells of a  
<br />
multicellular organism
<br />
3. the networks of electrical communication in organisms with central  
<br />
nervous systems
<br />
4. the networks of internal mental communication in higher organisms  
<br />
such that consciousness is generated.
<br />
5. the networks of external communications among members of social  
<br />
and cultural communities.
<br />
6. the networks of eco-system &quot;communications&quot; that sustain the  
<br />
dynamics of ecosystems as organizations of species and geological  
<br />
circumstances.
<br />
(This categorization of bionetworks is somewhat arbitrary but is  
<br />
adequate for this general discussion.  The important point, with one  
<br />
exception, is that the concept of bionetworks is given clarity and  
<br />
distinctiveness by separation of Aristotelian categories. )
<br />
<p>The exception to the Aristotelian categories mentioned above emerges  
<br />
from the discovery of the properties of electricity in the 17, 18 and  
<br />
19 th Centuries.  Aristotelian categories FAIL to address electrical  
<br />
phenomenon.  The description of electrical cycles (networks) by  
<br />
Kirchhoff in the 1840s was a major event in the history of science.   
<br />
(The modern concepts of informations are closely associated with  
<br />
electronic communications technology that are direct applications of  
<br />
Kirchhoff networks or circuits.)  However, Kirchhoff's laws applied  
<br />
only to the flow of one category of electricity, the electrons.  The  
<br />
second category of electric particles, the nuclei, to not follow  
<br />
Kirchhoff's laws and circuitry.  Thus, the mystery of how to classify  
<br />
the electrical properties of biological systems can not be addressed  
<br />
in terms of Kirchhoff's networks.
<br />
<p>As noted in FIS post number II, the mathematical of bionetworks  
<br />
depends on the atomic numbers and the combinations of chemical  
<br />
elements.  This mathematics was developed by chemists in order to  
<br />
describe empirical observations in laboratory experiments and living  
<br />
systems.  The fact that the description of bionetworks at all levels  
<br />
of organization depends on the mathematics of atomic numbers and  
<br />
chemical combinations is deeply inconvenient to theorists, who often  
<br />
attempt to ignore the importance of the mathematical roots of  
<br />
bionetworks and their description in terms of molecules.  The direct  
<br />
correspondence between electrical particles, associative rules, and  
<br />
bionetwork behaviors is the basis for genetic information and  
<br />
chemical communication in all categories of bionetworks outlined above.
<br />
<p>For examples of the meaning of chemical mathematics and chemical  
<br />
logic in information theory, consider the following:
<br />
<p>1. The science of thermodynamics excludes chemical structures from  
<br />
the equations of energy and entropy.  The linkage between  
<br />
electrochemical particles and thermodynamic equations is only via the  
<br />
number of particles and the equilibrium constant for re-arrangements  
<br />
of particles.  CHEMICAL STRUCTURAL INFORMATION is excluded from  
<br />
thermodynamics.  Consequently, the formalism that operates during  
<br />
cellular reproduction of its chemical components is also excluded by  
<br />
thermodynamics.  There is nothing mystical or revolutionary about  
<br />
this conclusion.  The necessity of continuous mathematics is  
<br />
intrinsic to the differential equations that are the root of the  
<br />
mathematical theory of thermodynamics.  Statistical mechanics, an  
<br />
approximation of the theory, is a valid approximation for very large  
<br />
populations of molecules, not for a single molecule of DNA.
<br />
<p>2. Quantum mechanics, as a mechanical theory, merely describes the  
<br />
motion of electrical particles in space and time.  The notion of a  
<br />
species of a network is absent from quantum mechanics.  In order to  
<br />
attempt to apply mathematical formula to a collection of electrical  
<br />
particles, one must start by describing the particular isomer, the  
<br />
particular organization of the electrical particles.  CHEMICAL  
<br />
STRUCTURAL INFORMATION becomes the starting point for quantum  
<br />
mechanical description of bionetworks, not vice-versa.
<br />
<p>These two lines of reasoning lead to a deep conclusion.
<br />
<p>We need a new theory of information for living systems.  A principle  
<br />
task of the new science will be to describe the flow of electrical  
<br />
particles in bionetworks.
<br />
<p>I now turn to posts of the last week.
<br />
<p>Michel message (Digest 482) includes:
<br />
<p>&quot;An example here: there are various file formats used to store chemical
<br />
structures on computer (mol, mol2, pdb, cas, csd, etc..), and many
<br />
users are asking for an universal format. BABEL do conversions, but
<br />
developpers would like to programme themselves the input/output modules
<br />
reading/writing molecular structures. There are tasks groups working
<br />
on this topic, but I am not optimistic: as a consequence of the multiple
<br />
definitions of &quot;structure&quot;, it is impossible to define a file format
<br />
handling all situations for all users: it would be an enormous dataset,
<br />
so much complicated that nobody would use it.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC response:
<br />
<p>It is important to separate the concepts of chemical structure from  
<br />
the physical phase issues.  Water (hydrogen oxide? dihydro oxygen?) )  
<br />
as electrical particles is a name constructed from the components.   
<br />
Properties of populations of molecules must include the interaction  
<br />
among the individuals.)  The distinction can be classified as the  
<br />
distinction between esoteric and exoteric, the internal and the  
<br />
external.
<br />
<p>Yes, anyone familiar with the efforts to reduce chemical logic to  
<br />
binary logic understands the challenges of representing matter.  I  
<br />
think the general scientific public lacks appreciation for the  
<br />
perplexity of matter and its formal properties.  The steady stream of  
<br />
assertions that quantum mechanics and thermodynamics are substitutes  
<br />
for Aristotelian categories has persuaded nearly everyone, including  
<br />
almost the entire philosophical community, that science is merely  
<br />
physics and life is merely a footnote to the differential equations  
<br />
of continuous variables.  The concrete examples of the relations  
<br />
between atomic numbers and chemical structures (in post II) refute  
<br />
this argument conclusively.   Of course, the challenges of the  
<br />
discrete mathematics of DNA vastly exceed the simple concrete example  
<br />
of benzene as well as the millions of examples you cite.
<br />
<p>I am puzzled by the silence of the proponents of QM and TD with  
<br />
respect to information theory.
<br />
Should we assume silence is assent?
<br />
<p>Ana's message (Digest 483) includes:
<br />
<p>&quot;Commonly in chemistry the &quot;general feeling&quot; when talking about  
<br />
standards is
<br />
not really optimistic.&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Markup languages and particularly XML are often considered to be the
</em><br />
universal format for structured documents on the web. But today this
<br />
meta-language is widely used for representing any structured data, and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly scientific and hence chemistry data.&quot;
</em><br />
<p>After discussing current efforts toward standards, she concludes:
<br />
&quot;I think it is one
<br />
of the ways to consolidate a chemical standard.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC response:
<br />
<p>Thank you for the extensive listing of websites.  FISers who seek a  
<br />
deeper knowledge of the practical challenges of representing matter  
<br />
will find these links to be a rich source of information, tactics and  
<br />
strategies.
<br />
<p>With regard to these efforts to translate chemical structures into  
<br />
some derivative of binary logic, I share your pessimism.  ( I worked  
<br />
in this area for several years while designing drugs for epilepsey.)
<br />
<p>As noted above, I believe the theoretical problem is much deeper and  
<br />
that the challenge lies at the root of the interfaces between  
<br />
classification and representation.  Aristotelian categories fail  
<br />
because electrical concepts are not included.  These categories are  
<br />
constructed for the visible world.  Chemical logic is based on  
<br />
individual particles in an INVISIBLE world.  How does one apply the  
<br />
notion of &quot;universals&quot; to the invisible world of electrical particles?
<br />
<p>Pedro (Digest 484) writes:
<br />
&quot;Arguing or exploring about an overarching &quot;logic of chemistry&quot; (and  
<br />
around &quot;non arithmetic&quot; atomic numbers) as Jerry suggests, may be  
<br />
fertile, but one may easily forget that chemistry has to tackle a  
<br />
&quot;plurality of simultaneous occurrences&quot;, in general involving very  
<br />
complex physical interactions about, for instance, charge, spin,  
<br />
lattice, orbitals... where, in each one, by large nonlinearities  
<br />
dominate; and where the &quot;composite&quot; object --eg, a complex  
<br />
biomolecule-- becomes miles away from being &quot;reduced&quot; bona fide in  
<br />
its chemical global properties down to a reasonable system of  
<br />
physical-mathematical laws.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC response:
<br />
<p>Certainly, the composition, the putting together, of various theories  
<br />
leads to vast mathematical challenges.  The intractability of such  
<br />
calculations is well established.  The emergence of intractability of  
<br />
the mathematics of dynamical systems whenever three or more bodies  
<br />
are present is well known (since Poincare.)  That is not the issue at  
<br />
hand for chemical information.
<br />
<p>Pedro, in a portion of your comment, I think you are overlooking the  
<br />
obvious.  Namely, that chemical calculations work for any stable  
<br />
chemical molecule.  The chemical calculations for DNA molecules with  
<br />
millions of electrical particles yield exact solutions.   Poincare's  
<br />
rule of three objects (&quot;Three implies chaos&quot;) is what fails.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From another perspective, your remark is on target.  Chemistry is  
<br />
based on exact relations between number, properties and identities.   
<br />
However, the relations between number and identity can be created  
<br />
with a small subset of the properties, not all the properties of the  
<br />
identity must be known to create the name.
<br />
<p>A similar rule is used for the uniqueness of bionetworks and names of  
<br />
biological species.  The classification of a new species only  
<br />
requires that one identifies the substantial distinctions between the  
<br />
known and the unknown.  The chemical identity of bionetworks is much  
<br />
stronger than the traditional biological basis of genera and species  
<br />
(derived from Aristotelian categories).  Thus, chemical logic has  
<br />
lead to a revolution in the classifications of biological taxonomies.
<br />
<p>Pedro continues:
<br />
&quot;Maybe the points on natural computer science raised by Kevin and  
<br />
Gordana are related. We may easily take for granted that a coverage  
<br />
under the umbrella of &quot;mathematical machines&quot; working on sophisticate  
<br />
topological properties of electronic circuits, by the use of Boolean  
<br />
networks operating on solid-state devices (and functionally  
<br />
independent), is the natural theoretical model for any &quot;informational  
<br />
or computational occurrence.&quot; Even the world itself, not only as a  
<br />
theoretical object, may appear as a gigantic computer, a la Wheeler  
<br />
(nope... or maybe, yes, but along a dramatic reinterpretation of the  
<br />
whole three mechanics --classical, statistical, quantum? Excuse me  
<br />
the wild derivation)&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC response:
<br />
<p>I think you are presupposing that somehow or other, a certain  
<br />
&quot;Aristotelian universality&quot; of quantity ensures that all computations  
<br />
will work with the same number system.  I think the evidence is the  
<br />
opposite. A range of computational processes exist.  In particular,  
<br />
modern electronic computations are all based on the binary system of  
<br />
logical trees.  Conceptually, these trees are of the same general  
<br />
nature as the logical trees of Aristotelian categories or biological  
<br />
classification.  The failure of the binary system of computation for  
<br />
chemical computation with electrical particles was already addressed  
<br />
in terms of relations to  empirical fact.  If you would like to play  
<br />
with these concepts, pick up an introductory chemical textbook and  
<br />
attempt to classify valences of elements in molecules as logical  
<br />
trees. You will quickly see that it is a hopeless task, even for  
<br />
simple ionic matter.
<br />
<p>Each bionetwork performs its own particular calculating processes  
<br />
that transform numerical relationships.  The bioprocessing of genetic  
<br />
information is specific to the species.  Note that this view of  
<br />
individual identity FOLLOWS from the concept of atomic numbers and is  
<br />
EXCLUDED by the simple arithmetic rules!
<br />
<p>Pedro concludes with:
<br />
<p>&quot;If I could bring order into these studies, the starting point, or  
<br />
say one of the basic pillars of the &quot;information bridge&quot; upon the  
<br />
biomolecular turbulent waters, in my opinion, should be built around  
<br />
the characterization of molecular recognition events, downwards and  
<br />
upwards.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC response:
<br />
<p>I concur with the sentiment but do not not like the roots of some of  
<br />
the words chosen to express it.
<br />
<p>&quot;recognition&quot; as a form of cognition does not suggest the possibility  
<br />
of inference.  Biomolecules, under the circumstances of living  
<br />
systems, infer conclusions from the organizations of numbers.  The  
<br />
inferential processes can be described as encodings and decodings.   
<br />
It is a logical process of some sort or another.
<br />
<p>Steven Zenith (Digest 485) states many strong conclusions.  I am  
<br />
uncertain as to how they fit into the discussion of the concept of  
<br />
bionetworks, so I will respond with questions:
<br />
<p>1. What notions of classical philosophy support the views expressed?
<br />
2. Why are the scientific problems within the USA different from  
<br />
scientific problems elsewhere?
<br />
3. How would an improved theory of information, in particular,  
<br />
bionetwork information theory, contribute to transdisciplinary  
<br />
communication?
<br />
4. Which of the foundations of logic do you refer to?
<br />
<p>Stan (Digest 486) writes:
<br />
<p>&quot;It is clear that while our models of the world are
<br />
as fully explicit as possible (thereby modeling the world as  
<br />
mechanistic),
<br />
the world itself is to one degree or other vague.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC response:
<br />
<p>I do not concur that are models of the world are &quot;as fully explicit  
<br />
as possible.&quot;
<br />
The richness of mathematical explication is simply beyond imagination.
<br />
Indeed, science remains in its infancy, particularly the chemical  
<br />
sciences.
<br />
Perhaps you read much to much into physical theories?
<br />
And the intractability of continuous dynamics?
<br />
<p>The assertion that:
<br />
&quot;the world itself is to one degree or other vague&quot;
<br />
is gratuitous philosophy and appears to run counter to the history of  
<br />
science, particularly the chemical sciences.
<br />
<p>Stan, if my memory serves me correctly, you were educated as a chemist.
<br />
May I ask you a question?
<br />
&nbsp;From you philosophical perspective, and from the perspective of  
<br />
mathematical philosophy that numbers are abstractions,
<br />
and from the success of the atomic numbers in providing an  
<br />
organization framework for chemical calculations,
<br />
how do you distinguish among the concepts of number, matter and  
<br />
identity?
<br />
<p>Rafael (Digest 487) introduces a number of salient terms and  
<br />
perspectives:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with Shannon information, the concepts of encoding,  
<br />
transmission and decoding create relations among at least three  
<br />
distinct dynamical systems - three potential Poincare objects.  The  
<br />
mutual pre-understanding of the encoding and decoding mechanisms in  
<br />
Shannon machines is a prerequisite for message communication.  The  
<br />
mutual pre-understanding of binary message  arrangements remove the  
<br />
potential for chaos and reduce the choices to one or zero, a signal  
<br />
or no signal at all.  Thus it functions as a logic tree.
<br />
<p>While similar circumstances prevail in bionetworks, the messages are  
<br />
not binary, rather they are polynomials in the sense that each  
<br />
molecule has a name composed from many parts.
<br />
Secondly, while the parts of the Shannon machine are easily  
<br />
distinguished such is not the case for bionetworks.  The demands of  
<br />
biological reproduction require that each part functions in multiple  
<br />
roles.  In addition, the bionetwork as a whole must be able to  
<br />
construct itself.
<br />
<p>The structure of time is a special issue in itself.  The bionetwork,  
<br />
not as a logical tree, but as a system of feedback and feedforward  
<br />
cycles, constructs, in contingency with its exoteric ecosystem, its  
<br />
own time domain - its life cycle.
<br />
<p>Within Rafael's message, a quote from Loet caught my eye.
<br />
&quot;Loets answer was that &quot;we can make an analogy among almost every  
<br />
system. This may serve us a heuristics.&quot;
<br />
<p>Does Loet wish to imply that the direct inferences between molecular  
<br />
genetic events and human health are merely heuristics?
<br />
While the difficulties of the multiple contingencies of development  
<br />
are daunting, I do not think the relations are analogies at all.  The  
<br />
bionetworks generate adults from zygotes, that is established fact.   
<br />
The challenge is to find a language, or invent a science, that keeps  
<br />
the many perspectives in collaborative moods.  In other words, the  
<br />
task is in the choice of verbs, not the choice of nouns.  The nouns  
<br />
are given to use by the existence of correspondence relations - the  
<br />
existential logic of the bionetwork.
<br />
<p>Writing this message has already consumed much of my day.  I must  
<br />
close and return to other tasks.  In closing, it appears that the  
<br />
concept of bionetworks generates several deep issues with regard to a  
<br />
theory of information for living systems:
<br />
<p>1. What is the nature of biological computations if atomic numbers  
<br />
are not arithmetic numbers?
<br />
2. What are the consequences of atomic numbers for the  
<br />
computerization of chemical structures?
<br />
3, What is the appropriate language for describing the exchange of  
<br />
&quot;knowledge&quot; (molecular recognition) within a bionetwork?
<br />
4. What is the appropriate language for describing the sentences of  
<br />
relations in perplexifiction or the layering of semantic structures  
<br />
on the basis of size?
<br />
5. What is Steven seeking to communicate?
<br />
6. What are the consequences, beyond the preservation of  
<br />
calculability, of separating the concept of structure from the  
<br />
concept of dynamics?
<br />
7. What would be a suitable form of Aristotelian categories such that  
<br />
the concepts of electricity would be inclusive within the logical
