                <p>
                    I thank everyone on this list for the lively and excellent discussion
                    <br />
                    that we had late last year on social and cultural complexity. There is
                    <br />
                    much in that discussion to file and think about.
                    <br />
                <p>I attempt here to spark a new discussion. The immediate example is not
                    <br />
                    social/cultural complexity (although the example certainly generates
                    <br />
                    social and cultural complexity), but something more fundamental: the
                    <br />
                    complexity of the human brain. As I hope to show, some questions about
                    <br />
                    brain complexity lead into general questions about social and cultural
                    <br />
                    complexity, and indeed about complexity in general.
                    <br />
                <p>I need hardly laud the qualities of the human brain. It is large
                    <br />
                    (relative to body mass), differentiated, organized, comprised of
                    <br />
                    millions of neurons, and always capable of doing things that earlier
                    <br />
                    humans never encountered (like typing an email message). I have often
                    <br />
                    wondered how the brain evolved to be able to resolve problems that
                    <br />
                    earlier humans never knew--but that is a topic for another discussion.
                    <br />
                <p>My purpose here is more limited. It is to explore the topic of the
                    <br />
                    complexity of the human brain. Most persons, and certainly nearly all
                    <br />
                    scientists, would concur that the brain is complex. Its differentiation
                    <br />
                    and organization fit my concept of complexity, which I offered at the
                    <br />
                    start of this FIS session.
                    <br />
                <p>In that inaugural message I described my collaboration with Timothy
                    <br />
                    Allen, a brilliant ecologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
                    <br />
                    Tim likes to challenge audiences about the complexity of the brain.
                    <br />
                    After he first raised the matter with me, I thought of the following
                    <br />
                    example: For certain extreme types of epilepsy, the treatment is to cut
                    <br />
                    the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers that connect the brain's
                    <br />
                    hemispheres. It seems to work: People who have the treatment go on to
                    <br />
                    have great relief of their seizures. I am not sure why it works, but I
                    <br />
                    am happy for the relief that people obtain.
                    <br />
                <p>But this poses an interesting dilemma in complexity. For the purpose of
                    <br />
                    this treatment, the brain is not complex at all. It is, in fact, a
                    <br />
                    simple system, comprised of only three parts: the left hemisphere, the
                    <br />
                    right hemisphere, and the corpus callosum. The keyboard on which I write
                    <br />
                    this is more complex than that.
                    <br />
                <p>Is the brain complex or simple? Does it depend, as former President
                    <br />
                    Clinton might say, on what the meaning of 'is' is? Does the complexity
                    <br />
                    of the human brain rely on human semantics? The Nobel Laureate Murray
                    <br />
                    Gell-Mann once suggested that the complexity of a system can be measured
                    <br />
                    by the length of the shortest description of its regularities. In such a
                    <br />
                    linguistic approach, the brain in this treatment of epilepsy is very
                    <br />
                    simple: two hemispheres and a bundle of nerves connecting them.
                    <br />
                <p>So the brain is simple for this purpose. Therein lies the broader
                    <br />
                    question. Is the complexity of the brain relative to the perspective of
                    <br />
                    the analyst? Or is the complexity of the brain innate? Surely a simple
                    <br />
                    brain of three parts could not generate social and cultural complexity
                    <br />
                    as we know them? But to a doctor treating a patient with epilepsy, this
                    <br />
                    is irrelevant. The brain is simple, and so is the treatment.
                    <br />
                <p>Inevitably we are led to more general issues. Is social/cultural
                    <br />
                    complexity an attribute of a society/culture, or is it an attribute of
                    <br />
                    the observer's perspective? Is complexity innate or asscribed? Clearly
                    <br />
                    this question applies to any kind of complex system, not just social or
                    <br />
                    cultural ones.
                    <br />
                <p>I hope you find this question as challenging as I do. I don't have a
                    <br />
                    firm answer to it, and look forward to the discussion.
                    <br />
                <p>With best wishes,
                    <br />
                <p>Joseph Tainter
