                    Reply to Guy:
                    <br />
                <p>you touched on an interesting theme. Over the past few years I dealt with
                    <br />
                    works / theories of econophysicists in an attempt to approach business
                    <br />
                    cycles (i.e. large scale fluctuations in economy) from different standpoint
                    <br />
                    than the neoclassical economics (NCE). Working papers from SFI and published
                    <br />
                    stuff in Physica A are providing a fresh and intriguing perspective indeed,
                    <br />
                    compared to NCE. Econophysicists had most success (in my opinion) in
                    <br />
                    modeling financial markets and here they are, I believe, definitively
                    <br />
                    superior to NCE models.
                    <br />
                    After a closer look at their models outside financial markets, I got the
                    <br />
                    impression that their major contribution to the field consist of introducing
                    <br />
                    nonlinear models and computer simulation (fine example are the works of Paul
                    <br />
                    Ormerod and co-workers in Physica A). Although their models has been freed
                    <br />
                    from flawed NCE assumptions, they are mechanical, highly reductionist and
                    <br />
                    with almost no feeling for what may be relevant in economic realm (except
                    <br />
                    for P. Ormerod, and of course B. Arthur and probably some other guys). For
                    <br />
                    example some models (Amaral et .al, 1998; Matia et al. 2004) suggest that
                    <br />
                    economic dynamics arises from the interplay of internal diversification of
                    <br />
                    firms into various divisions and their random multiplicative growth. In my
                    <br />
                    view this is absolute nonsense. Eugene Stanley himself recognized that
                    <br />
                    empirical results obtained in econophysics still lack firm theoretical
                    <br />
                    foundations and, according to economist S. Durlauf, econophysicist's models
                    <br />
                    generally lack economic insight. As I see it, econophysics like the earlier
                    <br />
                    Newtonian paradigm which lies at the basis of NCE, cannot provide a
                    <br />
                    satisfactory paradigm for social sciences: we have just moved the focus from
                    <br />
                    equilibrium to nonequlibrim thinking and modeling. Socio-economic change and
                    <br />
                    evolution cannot be reduced to aggregate flows and stocks which have an
                    <br />
                    &quot;intrinsic&quot; dynamics and are unrelated to institutional framework and
                    <br />
                    historical time. Some other arguments are in the earlier postings on SOC
                    <br />
                    (replies to Bob and Stan). More details are available in two papers if
                    <br />
                    anyone is interested.
                    <br />

                <p>
                <p>I may have missed it, but I have been surprised that the recently emerged
                    <br />
                    discipline of econophysics has not yet received much attention during this
                    <br />
                    FIS session. This discipline is being forged by the work of physicists like
                    <br />
                    Eugene Stanley and economists like Brian Arthur, and it is founded on the
                    <br />
                    notion that economies can be better understood as self-organizing complex
                    <br />
                    dynamical systems governed by the rules of physics. I am personally
                    <br />
                    optimistic about the value of this approach to understanding economics, but
                    <br />
                    I don't know enough about it to make a good argument for it here. I hope
                    <br />
                    that this post will help to stimulate some discussion about econophysics in
                    <br />
                    this forum.
