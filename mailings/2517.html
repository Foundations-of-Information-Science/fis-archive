                            Information� should be based on more solid foundations. We recall that
                            &gt;quantum mechanics by itself is a huge building having the
                            sand-fundament � the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. On one hand,
                            there was created the &gt;advanced mathematical formalism (calculus of
                            probabilities in the complex Hilbert space) giving predictions which are
                            supported by all existing experimental data. &gt;On the other hand, it is
                            still unclear why this formalism works so well and moreover it is not
                            clear what it really predicts, because by the orthodox Copenhagen
                            &gt;interpretation (which is the conventional interpretation) quantum
                            mechanics is not about physical reality by itself, but about just our
                            observations (of what?). &gt;Problems which were of a purely philosophic
                            interest during one hundred years became technological and business
                            problems.&nbsp; (Yes and its seemed we for some &gt;reason lost the
                            interest in the philosophic questions � but I think it is simply pushed
                            into the background because the realists cannot straighten out the
                            puzzle. AK)<br>
                            &gt;Therefore �Quantum Information� gives a new great chance for
                            reconsideration of quantum foundations. All unsolved problems of quantum
                            foundations are &gt;essentially amplified in the quantum information

                            can go on for ever and in vain � and science we will not proceed an inch
                            until the day we are prepared to accept this (simple) fact that human
                            knowing is in principle subjective. There are several stronger reasons
                            but the success of Copenhagen interpretation to reject the human
                            possibility to attribute ontological features to the presumed reality. My
                            claim (and SOA�s) is that no coherent definition of information is
                            possible as long as we keep on trying to make reference to a �reality�
                            that is unknowable in principle. Information relates to the speaking
                            (modelling) knower � and what is in his mind (his experience), just as
                            Bohr says. However his way of reasoning does not only apply to QM � it

                    <font face="Times New Roman, Times">I don't think that this is an
                        argument for antirealism, but for skepticism. At least it can be made out
                        that way, so there is another alternative. The choice is not between just
                        either we can check our representations against the external world or we
                        only have constructions (or models) to rely on, but also we can hold our
                        models to be falsifiable, and withhold final judgement (this was Hume's
                        route). This position has a very old argument in its favour. The
                        constructivist deviation is very recent. The problem with it is that our
                        models may contain information about the outside world, so to dismiss
                        them as not having that, and judging reality only on our models is
                        equally unjustified and misleading.&nbsp; There is an argument known to
                        the Greeks, called the Diallelus (the wheel). There is a discussion of it
                        in Nicholas Rescher, <i>Methodological Pragmatism</i>, New York
                        University Press (1977) pp. 15-18. The basic idea is that we have a means
                        of judging truth, or at least acceptability. Call it C. C can be any
                        method you like, simple or complex; it does not matter to the argument.
                        Now we ask if C is justified. Either the justification is in terms of C,
                        which is circular, or in terms of some C', different from C. If the
                        latter, we need to ask (if we did at first for C), is C' justified? Then
                        we are back on the wheel, and so on. Your argument, Arne, can be put in
                        these terms: Let O be the truth, and C be our perceptual apparatus; then
                        we can know O only through C, but what validates C? We are on the wheel,
                        not on the route to taking models to be the essence of reality. This can
                        be seen easily. Suppose that we have a criterion C for judging if our
                        models are acceptable. What justifies C? We are back on the wheel. I see
                        no advantage in retreating to models as the epistemic ground, and it
                        smacks of a sort of verificationism to me. In any case, it adds an
                        epicycle to the problem that can be dealt with just by acknowledging that
                        perceptual apparatus and models are part of the information we have, and
                        we need to be sceptical about whether we are dealing with information
                        from the world or from our C in this case. Then we can get down to the
                        business of trying to figure out how to distinguish the two classes of
                        information (externally originated and internally originated). The first
                        step, I think, is to deny that we have any evidence that there are things
                        in themselves out there; we cannot, by postulation, have information
                        about them, only information transferred from them through an information
                        channel, which invariably adds noise, some nonrandom. So at best we have
                        access to information that forms patterns, some perhaps real and
                        objective, other parts artefactual. Is there a criterion for
                        distinguishing artefactuality from reality? Certainly not some C that is
                        infallible, or we are on the wheel, but there might be criteria that work
                        fairly well as long as we don't get all paranoid about certainty. In
                        traditional science, invariance under transformations of models has been
                        an important criterion (Galileo, Einstein), but certainly not the only
                        one. It seems to me that it can be applied to QM through a structuralist
                        approach to QM.&nbsp; I don't expect that this will move committed
                        inernalists, constructivists, antirealists and antimodernists (it's too
                        early or impossible to know what postmodernism would be -- see Bruno
                        Latour, <i>We Have Never Been Modern</i>, Harvard UP,
                        <a href="../../www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LATWEH.html" eudora="autourl">
                            http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LATWEH.html</a>). I colleague of mine,
                        antirealist historian -- Maggie Osler, remarked before examining a
                        realist MA thesis with me, that she thought that being a realist or
                        antirealist was genetically determined, or at least innate. She may have
                        been right. In any case, the same problem of finding invariances applies
                        to the antirealist -- they are of great scientific interest for whatever
                        reason, but it is harder to justify.<br><br>
                        As I have mentioned previously, a number of us are producing a book
                        <i>What's wrong with things?: Information-theoretic ontic structural
                            realism</i>, that addresses QM this way, among other subjects. If anybody
                        would like to read and comment on the manuscript, please get in touch
                        with me. It is in revision right now, but any input we can get from this
                        esteemed group would be valuable. This book relies on Peirce for one
                        major premise, but does not investigate Peircean semiotics, which I think
                        is required for a more complete answer to Arne's question of a way out of
                        the dilemma.<br><br>
