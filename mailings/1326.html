<p>
Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>Much has been said here about the definition of /meaning/ and 
<br />
/information/ by different people. Let me bundle my objections into the 
<br />
following observations.
<br />
<p>Information and meaning are distinct, IMHO, in one very fundamental 
<br />
respect.  Information, by my definition, does not require our experience 
<br />
while meaning does.
<br />
<p>&quot;The difference that makes a difference&quot; is, I will contend, a statement 
<br />
materially relevant to the definition of information in that it 
<br />
describes consequence in a system of information.  But if we are to 
<br />
define meaning formally in this context alone then I do not know how to 
<br />
distinguish one from the other.
<br />
<p>Such a definition would argue that the production of Helium has 
<br />
meaning,  for example. 
<br />
<p>I, at least, contend that Helium evolves in stars without our experience 
<br />
of it - although, I have a caveat here that has to do with my model that 
<br />
I will not pursue at this juncture.
<br />
<p>Information, in my definition, is not statically descriptive, it 
<br />
includes how things change.
<br />
<p>Meaning might be called &quot;the /experience of/ information&quot; and plays a 
<br />
lone role in apprehension and a one-to-many role in communication - but 
<br />
it is a little more complex than this for one needs to introduce the 
<br />
notions of knowing and intent.  
<br />
<p>Meaning in apprehension is the experience of the embodied /trace/ of a 
<br />
/sign/ - the experience of a /mark/.  Meaning in communication exits in 
<br />
both apprehension by the reader and /intent/ by the writer. In the 
<br />
writer, it is the experience of the creation process - that I call 
<br />
/semiosis/ (distinct in detail from Peirce's definition) - that is, 
<br />
intent is the meaning embodied by the writer in their creation of a 
<br />
metaphysical mark - it continues as the experience that the writer has 
<br />
in their experience of the mark.
<br />
<p>I might put this more generally as information is not something that 
<br />
requires consciousness while meaning is.  A rock falling through space 
<br />
is an information system in an information system.  A rock falling 
<br />
through space in an information system that includes its impact with the 
<br />
planet Earth has meaning only because conscious entities will choose to 
<br />
engage with the information system involved.
<br />
<p>I understand the appeal of the phrase &quot;a difference that makes a 
<br />
difference&quot; as a definition of meaning but it makes me uncomfortable.  
<br />
It is esoteric and has Lao Tzu's cryptic mysticism - &quot;all can know 
<br />
beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness&quot; - is the difference 
<br />
that makes a difference but at least Lao Tzu makes it clear that it is 
<br />
the /experience of/ the difference that makes a difference.  Meaning is 
<br />
an aesthetic. 
<br />
<p>In formal matters I prefer that we use the notion of /correctness/.
<br />
<p>My discomfort arises primarily from any attempt to disembody meaning - 
<br />
or to detach it from consciousness.  To do so leaves those of us 
<br />
interested in such matters with unnecessary neology.  Worse, it changes 
<br />
how we all behave toward information - and this derives from the common 
<br />
informal idioms found in language use of the term.  
<br />
<p>&quot;What does 1 + 1 mean?&quot;  is no distance from &quot;What does a solar eclipse 
<br />
mean?&quot; - both mean something in our experience of them and that meaning 
<br />
is strongly sensitive to the context of what we know.  If we know about 
<br />
planetary orbits we may come to know that there is no meaning to be 
<br />
associated with the solar eclipse and some coincidental calamity.
<br />
<p>As an aside one of my favorite and most evocative examples related to 
<br />
meaning is the work &quot;de Kooning erased&quot; by Robert Rauschenburg.  For 
<br />
those of you not fortunate enough to live close to the Museum of Modern 
<br />
Art in San Francisco where this wonderful piece resides, let me explain. 
<br />
<p>One day in New York in the 1950s Robert Rauschenburg asks his fellow, 
<br />
and successful, abstract expressionist Willem de Kooning for a drawing.  
<br />
He explains that he wishes to erase the drawing as a work of art and 
<br />
insists that de Kooning gives him a drawing that he would feel the lose 
<br />
of.  de Kooning says he does not like the idea but he appreciates what 
<br />
Rauschenburg is tying to achieve. He agrees but retaliates by giving 
<br />
Rauschenburg a drawing of such merit that he will find it very hard to 
<br />
commit the act.
<br />
<p>When explaining the piece - often shown on video at the SFMOMA when the 
<br />
piece is on display (it is in the permanent collection so it not always 
<br />
in the available rotation)  - Rauschenburg says with emphasis, &quot;It was 
<br />
just the IDEA!&quot;
<br />
<p>Think awhile about the role and definition of meaning here, among the 
<br />
players and, if you can, get to see the piece.  It is a fully erased 
<br />
drawing of de Kooning's - it took months to complete - in a frame, 
<br />
behind glass with a title (executed by Jasper Johns incidentally) &quot;de 
<br />
Kooning erased&quot;.  
<br />
<p>Now your responses and reasoning - the meaning you assign - to my 
<br />
description here will be profoundly different from your experience of 
<br />
the piece and I encourage you to watch people react to it if you get the 
<br />
chance.
<br />
<p>Sincerely,
<br />
Steven
