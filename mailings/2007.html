Dear Loet
<br />
<p>Thank you for your remarks!  Our definition of &quot;worldview&quot; is basically 
<br />
equal to the term Weltanschauung, and differs only in that it explicitly 
<br />
introduces objective knowledge as its constitutive part - a distinction that 
<br />
is methodologically appropriate for analysis of Western societies. We do 
<br />
acknowledge the existence of mutually competing worldviews, but there is 
<br />
always a dominant one that streamlines collective behavior. We can, for 
<br />
example, condense the prevailing (Western) worldview around three basic 
<br />
dimensions: materialism, rationality and hard-wired working ethic (details 
<br />
are presented in Matutinovic, forthcoming in International Journal of 
<br />
Sustainable Development and World Ecology). This may be put also in 
<br />
different terms (dimensions), but any such combination of values and beliefs 
<br />
must be internally coherent and it must logically link to the extant 
<br />
institutional framework. The very existence of alternative worldviews in 
<br />
modernity, which &quot;disturb one another and thus provide another source of 
<br />
change&quot;, as you mention it, provides one of the pillars of societal 
<br />
adaptability. We wished to emphasize that the pace of adaptive institutional 
<br />
change is unpredictable, and therefore, Western civilization runs the risk 
<br />
of a major environmental crisis (see for example latest reports on the state 
<br />
of global ecosystems: Mooney, H., Cropper, A., and Reid, W. (2005). 
<br />
Confronting the human dilemma: How can ecosystems provide sustainable 
<br />
services to benefit society? Nature, Vol. 434:7033, 561-562.; Scheffer, M., 
<br />
Carpenter, S., Foley, J. A., Folke, C., and Walker, B. (2001). Catastrophic 
<br />
Shifts In Ecosystems. Nature, 413, 591-596.).
<br />
<p>Concerning the knowledge-based economy and its impact on environment, I have 
<br />
a question: if we, for example, label the first fifty years of the 20th 
<br />
century as belonging to the resource-based economy and the subsequent period 
<br />
as a transition to the knowledge-based economy, than I can see no 
<br />
improvement at all. On the contrary, as our technology becomes more advanced 
<br />
and our communication possibilities widen and become more sophisticated our 
<br />
impact on environment increases. This can be seen on the example of IT 
<br />
industry which epitomizes the &quot;New&quot; economy: computer manufacturing uses 
<br />
about 1000 toxic materials, including heavy metals, and its product life 
<br />
cycle is extremely short resulting in enormous waste disposal and leaching 
<br />
of toxics into environment. Following is the quote form E. Williams, 
<br />
Environ. Sci. Technol., 38 (22), 6166 -6174, 2004:
<br />
&quot;The total energy and fossil fuels used in producing a desktop computer with 
<br />
17-in. CRT monitor are estimated at 6400 megajoules (MJ) and 260 kg, 
<br />
respectively. This indicates that computer manufacturing is energy 
<br />
intensive: the ratio of fossil fuel use to product weight is 11, an order of 
<br />
magnitude larger than the factor of 1-2 for many other manufactured goods. 
<br />
This high energy intensity of manufacturing, combined with rapid turnover in 
<br />
computers, results in an annual life cycle energy burden that is 
<br />
surprisingly high: about 2600 MJ per year, 1.3 times that of a refrigerator. 
<br />
In contrast with many home appliances, life cycle energy use of a computer 
<br />
is dominated by production (81%) as opposed to operation (19%).&quot;
<br />
Besides IT, our increased ability to apply efficiently knowledge to 
<br />
manufacturing resulted in a myriad of new consumer products, cheap and 
<br />
attractive for use, which mass production, consumption, and short life 
<br />
cycles overburden the environment and degrade ecosystems around the earth. 
<br />
In the meantime, the &quot;resource based&quot; part of our economic activities did 
<br />
not diminish materially, except for their share in GDP.  Concerning Western 
<br />
energy intensive agriculture, it is so inextricably tied to oil reserves 
<br />
(both in terms of energy and in terms of chemical ingredients for mineral 
<br />
fertilizers and pesticides) and I have not been able to learn so far about 
<br />
an alternative, plausible solution for the post-petroleum era.
<br />
<p>Perhaps you may have an idea how to relate economic networks (as Bob and 
<br />
myself briefly addressed them), your vision of the knowledge-based economy, 
<br />
and the constraints arising from the dominant Western worldview. This may be 
<br />
an interesting direction for further discussion...
<br />
<p>The best
<br />
Igor

<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Igor and Bob,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your interesting opening to the discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While reading it, I had the impression that the &quot;worldview&quot; is too much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptualized as a single and closed system like a Kuhnian paradigm. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 16th century worldviews are in flux and internally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiated/differentiating. The economic system of the market, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, is mapped cognitively in a discourse other than the discourse of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics or the discourse of power. The different worldviews (codifications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the communication) disturb one another and thus can provide another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps, your own statement can be considered as one such worldview, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; namely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of ecosystems theory. In this view the resources are finite and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore exhaustible. Information resources, however, are not finite. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge-based economy (unlike a resource-based economy) other dynamics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the expansion may feed new loops into the system. For example, Holland is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of the largest producers of tomatos while tomatos can not be bred in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Holland naturally (because of the lack of sunshine). The production of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tomatos is completely knowledge-based. Indeed, this is energy-costly, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy is only finite at the level of the universe (and not at the level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the earth).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus, one can entertain very different worldviews. The interfaces among 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be considered as sources of innovation, for example, when market
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspectives and research perspectives can be interfaced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps, you can easily integrate this into your model?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With kind regards,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Loet
