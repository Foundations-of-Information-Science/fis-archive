<p>
Let me respond/comment Michel's, Karl's and Bob's postings (religion of
<br />
probability and definition of order). I would agree with Karl on Natural
<br />
numbers. Regarding Bob's combinatorial examples there is a single assumption
<br />
that numbers of possibilities should be hardly dependent on - discrete or
<br />
continuous space (incl. functional space too). So there can be an enormous
<br />
amount of calculated possibilities of various event's combinations, but in
<br />
reality different combinations are not equally possible. So number of
<br />
possible outcomes (or degrees of freedom) is usually reduced to some minimum
<br />
when those events/objects become a part of a larger system. Thus a complete
<br />
set of these most probable states each one dependent on it's own attractor
<br />
starts behaving like a discrete system with large although limited number of
<br />
different states with discontinuous transitions among them. Those states are
<br />
usually characterized by probability distributions or some &quot;limits of
<br />
tolerance&quot;. So in reality there are more similar (although I would not dare
<br />
saying identical) events than unique. That's why Case Based Reasoning (AI
<br />
approach to problem solving) works so well even for weather predictions or
<br />
various diagnosing tasks for machines and humans in technology and medicine.
<br />
Even ratios of species in a natural community follow certain patterns of
<br />
occurrence - they are never changing continuously, but always in a jumpy
<br />
manner. The same can be said about periodic system of chemical elements -
<br />
one can not use whatever sort of regression based on continuity to predict
<br />
characteristics of an element. But Mendelejev's periodical law based on
<br />
discrete assumptions can handle the problem quite easily. And eventually the
<br />
same is true for any natural phenomenon - spatial and functional transitions
<br />
among cells, atoms, molecules, and everything that we call objects or events
<br />
in our 4 dimensions - always occur as jumps. If one takes a real (not
<br />
modelled) gradient of salinity or temperature changing with depth in a lake
<br />
or sea, then the one again would notice many small jumps instead of an 
<br />
ideal&quot; continuous change. Now if the one assumes that &quot;the word should be
<br />
continuous (somebody prove it please !) and all the rest of it is just a
<br />
noise&quot; he will necessarily arrive to the conclusion as Bob wrote : &quot;the
<br />
fabric of causality manifests holes everywhere, at all levels&quot;... But is
<br />
this true ?..
<br />
Wouldn't the following sentence be more correct then: &quot;the fabric of our
<br />
XXI-st century knowledge still manifests holes everywhere, at all levels&quot;.
<br />
Isn't it so that violation of the causality law would also mean violation of
<br />
the I-st law of thermodynamics ? So if causality &quot;shows a hole&quot; somewhere in
<br />
physical world this should also mean the disproportion of
<br />
energy/matter/work/entropy and also a violation of E=mc2 during this &quot;holy&quot;
<br />
event. Shouldn't the law of causality play the same role in science as the
<br />
I-st law in Thermodynamics (the I-st law of Cyberdynamics ;-) should sound
<br />
great ! ) ?     But what if &quot;causality holes&quot; are true. Then let's remember
<br />
Lorenz who has got totaly different results with his famous system of
<br />
equations just because the computer rounded down the numbers stored in
<br />
memory. Is then our Universe a computer like the one Lorenz worked with
<br />
which tries to round-down numbers that seem too big for calculations and
<br />
thence &quot;causality holes&quot;, unpredictable behavior, chaos ?  Which assumption
<br />
is true then ?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Definition of order...
<br />
Here I would agree with Karl again. It seems like the &quot;order&quot; relates with
<br />
synchronicity i.e. interacting elements making a system are more orderly
<br />
then independent elements that do not make a system. Then a level of order
<br />
(in between these two marginal states) could be calculated as ratio of sync
<br />
among elements. Thus order of a perfect system would be equal to 1, order of
<br />
chaotic mixture of some independent non interacting parts eq 0. Let's found
<br />
what's in between on a real-world example - the Internet by taking a subset
<br />
of the internet - 1000 web sites located somewhere. Next step pinging (IT
<br />
term) those sites and looking whether they respond or not (how many packages
<br />
lost). if 900 sites responded (&quot;were in their places&quot; as Karl wrote), and
<br />
100 failed to respond, then system of those 1000 web sites would have a
<br />
degree of order eq to 0.9. Probably it should be considered as relatively
<br />
high... But the hard part in this is that in nature elements interact in
<br />
several ways/levels depending on the purpose of the system(s) they are parts
<br />
of. So in this case degree of order should be based on correct responses at
<br />
different communication levels (who knows their number ?).  And then posibly
<br />
adding up those ratios and dividing from number of levels - thus calculating
<br />
an average degree of order in the system :-). Just a speculation...
<br />
