<p>
Dear Jerry and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks a lot for the stimulating postings.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Were the questions I poised not relevant to a theory of information? If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are not relevant, then what would be relevant?
</em><br />
<p>I think they were quite relevant for that purpose but perhaps we are not 
<br />
capable of providing clear responses yet. The info 'thread' needs to be 
<br />
woven into finer strands in order to provide those clear responses --and in 
<br />
spite of this conference advancements we keep the info thread largely into 
<br />
the state of 'bundle' yet.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One possibility is that the strength of beliefs in entropy as the source 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of material information is so strong that it blocks thinking about generic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical issues related to science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this is the case, can someone &quot;make the case&quot; for entropy - that is, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systematically list the basic reasons that support the concept that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy can be generalized to cover all possible forms of communication / 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information?
</em><br />
<p>I think that entropy is one of these strategic regions where we should stop 
<br />
and have focused discussions (a nice outcome of this conference is that, 
<br />
yes, we have had acceptably focused discussions!). My suggestion in a 
<br />
previous message was to link entropy-symmetry-similarity-recognition, 
<br />
although not thinking on communication terms, rather on structures and 
<br />
processes, a la Leyton. And then we could jump to cellular matters of 
<br />
abductions, constraints, act. But before thinking on new focused sessions 
<br />
maybe some 'vacation' or a period of relaxed, unfocussed discussions would 
<br />
be convenient.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The absence of responses to the questions concerning abstraction suggest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the role of abstraction in science, philosophy and mathematics should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be publicly examined by this group.  The nature of abstraction is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamental to trans disciplinary discussions. Does anyone have a better 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suggestion on how to open the possibility of moving from eisegesis to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exegesis and theory construction?
</em><br />
<p>I strongly agree in the emphasis on the 'abstraction' matter and the 
<br />
trans-disciplinar. It is for me a germane way of considering the 
<br />
interdisciplinary problem (or perspectivism, or doctrine of limitation). 
<br />
Our abstractions in science advance throughout 'disciplinary avenues': it 
<br />
is a historic fact that we seldom discuss. And what happens when a 
<br />
conceptual problem impinges into different avenues of thought? A long 
<br />
turmoil of misunderstandings, conflicting corporative hierarchies, and 
<br />
specialism myopic attitudes follow (remember Ortega y Gasset's celebrated 
<br />
essay on &quot;the barbarianism of specialization&quot;). This seems to be the case 
<br />
with the info problem in our times... The willingness to tolerate 
<br />
heterogeneous ways of thought is a precondition for advancement. We have to 
<br />
keep pounding, hammering down each other's conceptual abstractions with the 
<br />
patience and good humor of the puzzle-solver... I do not advocate a 
<br />
permanent 'anything goes' as I suspect that the interdisciplinary nature 
<br />
inherent to basic info problems (relevant in most of your previous message 
<br />
questions) also demands a rigorous methodology, although different from the 
<br />
usual ways of discip. thought. Reflecting on the inter-or trans- 
<br />
methodology becomes a pressing need for us.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One area that philosophers could potentially contribute to is coding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory.  What is the common meaning of encoding and decoding and how are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems distinguished by their encoding capacities?  What are the sources 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of motion that generate encodings?  What are the path dependencies that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;support encoding operations?  Explication is needed, not merely explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The narratives of process philosophers (such as Whitehead) are often 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illuminating when applied to biological dynamics.  Could process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy become a base for theory building covering the component of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transmission of information?
</em><br />
<p>Let me turn to the cellular discussion in order to emphasize that there are 
<br />
different 'infos': structural, generative, communicational. The gist would 
<br />
not reside in anyone alone, but in the whole new dynamics of 'evanescent 
<br />
permanence' that together they are capable of implementing.
<br />
<p>The above looks too general, am affraid. So I will be happy to invest the 
<br />
remaining 50% of my weekly discussion capital to attempt some more concrete 
<br />
responses.
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
