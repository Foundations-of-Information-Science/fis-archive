Dear List,
<br />
<p>I must disagree with the notion that there is any real separation of  
<br />
nature and culture. There are things that can be known that do not  
<br />
exist - as a general category that includes culture - but culture  
<br />
does not stand alone - it's right up there with irrational numbers  
<br />
and televisions.
<br />
<p>The force of natural ethics (inevitable behaviors) is mediated by  
<br />
convention and manifest in the behavior of individuals - culture is  
<br />
merely one such convention.
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven
<br />

&gt; Dear colleagues,
&gt;
&gt; I agree with most of what is said, but it does not apply to social  
&gt; systems because these -- and to a lesser extent also psychological  
&gt; ones -- operate differently from the hierarchical formations that  
&gt; are generated &quot;naturally&quot;. That is why we oppose &quot;nature&quot; to  
&gt; &quot;culture&quot; in the semantics: cultural (and social) systems enable us  
&gt; to model the systems under study and this changes the hierarchical  
&gt; order. I understand that Maturana et al. argue that the next-order  
&gt; systems always model the lower-order ones, but then the word  
&gt; &quot;model&quot; is used metaphorically. The model (e.g., the biological)  
&gt; model enables us to reconstruct the system(s) under study to such  
&gt; an extent that we are able to intervene in these systems, e.g. by  
&gt; using a technology. This inverts the hierarchy.
&gt;
&gt; Thus, let me write in Stan's notation: biological {psychological  
&gt; {social}} -- or is this precisely the opposite order, Stan? -- then  
&gt; our scientific models enable us to change nature, for example, by  
&gt; building dykes like in Holland and thus we get: social {biological}  
&gt; since the ecological changes can also be planned in advance.
&gt;
&gt; While lower-order systems are able to entertain a model of the next- 
&gt; lower ones -- and even have to entertain a model -- human language  
&gt; enables us not only to exchange these models, but also to study  
&gt; them and to further codify them. The further codification sharpens  
&gt; the knife with which we can cut into the lower-level ones. We are  
&gt; not constrained to the next-order lower level, but we can freely  
&gt; move through the hierarchy and develop different specialties  
&gt; accordingly (chemistry, biology, etc.). Scientists are able to  
&gt; adjust the focus of the lense. This is a cultural achievement which  
&gt; was generated naturally, but once in place also had the possibility  
&gt; to distinguish between genesis and validity. No lower-level systems  
&gt; can raise and begin to answer this question. And doubling reality  
&gt; into a semantic domain that can operate relatively independently of  
&gt; the underlying (represented) layer increases the complexity which  
&gt; can be absorbed with an order of magnitude.
&gt;
&gt; The issue is heavily related to the issue of modernity as a  
&gt; specific form of social organization. While tribes (&quot;small groups&quot;)  
&gt; can still be considered using the &quot;natural&quot; metaphor, and high  
&gt; cultures were still organized hierarchically (with the emperor or  
&gt; the pope at the top), modern social systems set science &quot;free&quot; to  
&gt; pursue this reconstruction in a techno-economic evolution. &quot;All  
&gt; that is solid, will melt into air&quot; (Marx). Because of our  
&gt; biological body, we are part of nature, but our minds are entrained  
&gt; in a cultural dynamics at the supra-individual level (&quot;culture&quot;)  
&gt; which feeds back and at some places is able increasingly to invert  
&gt; the hierarchy.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt; I'll take a few minutes from my moving and dealing with academic  
&gt; emergencies at UKZN to make a comment here.
&gt;
&gt; Jerry brings up a point that keeps arising in the literature one  
&gt; constraints and information. Recall that Shannon said that they are  
&gt; the same thing. That is a clue.
&gt;
&gt; Loet and I dealt with this issue previously on this list about a  
&gt; year ago when he claimed that social communications channels open  
&gt; up new possibilities (analogous to Jerry's position here), and I  
&gt; asked him why this was so, since any further structure must reduce  
&gt; the possibilities, not increase them. We each promoted out view for  
&gt; a while, and then stopped, as it wasn't going anywhere. The reason  
&gt; is that there is nowhere to go with this issue. Both positions are  
&gt; correct, and they do not contradict each other; they are merely  
&gt; incompatible perspectives, much like Cartesian versus polar  
&gt; coordinates. The positions are not logically incompatible, but  
&gt; pragmatically   incompatible, in that they cannot both be adopted  
&gt; at the same time. This is a fairly common phenomenon in science. In  
&gt; fact I wrote my dissertation on it. There is a paper of mine,  
&gt; Pragmatic Incommensurability, in the Proceedings of the Philosophy  
&gt; of Science Association 1984 (PSA 1984) that goes into the issue in  
&gt; more detail, but not as much as in my thesis. I am kind of bored  
&gt; with the issue at the issue at this point, but it keeps coming up,  
&gt; so I'll say a bit more.
&gt;
&gt; Stan's bracket formulation is a logical restriction (constraint),  
&gt; with the outer bracketed items logically restricting the inner  
&gt; ones. It is a neat formulation for a system developed by W.E.  
&gt; Johnson in his book Logic, in which he called the inner elements  
&gt; determinates and the outer ones determinables. The idea is a basic  
&gt; one in the Philosophy business, and these are the technical terms  
&gt; used there, although they are somewhat awkward, being relative  
&gt; terms, and also not words used with their English meaning. Jerry's  
&gt; problem is that if the chemical opens up a huge range of  
&gt; possibilities not available to the physical, how can we call the  
&gt; physical a constraint on the chemical. I once asked Stan a similar  
&gt; question, and he gave me an answer that satisfied me enough not to  
&gt; pursue the issue. The answer requires a distinction concerning  
&gt; constraints (which, recall, is logically equivalent to information  
&gt; -- any connotative difference being irrelevant to my point here).  
&gt; My colleagues and coauthors Wayne Christensen and Cliff Hooker once  
&gt; referred to the difference between restricting and enabling  
&gt; constraints. The former restrict possibilities, while the latter  
&gt; are required in order to make things possible -- mush produces  
&gt; nothing. But there is no essential difference -- context, if  
&gt; anything, makes the difference. I say 'if anything' because in many  
&gt; cases constraints (indistinguishable from information by logic  
&gt; alone) do both: restrict and enable. There is no paradox here --  
&gt; they are two sides of the same coin. A Taoist like me sees them as  
&gt; Yin and Yang -- the Yang element is the defined and restrictive,  
&gt; active, controlling part, while the Yin is the open, receptive and  
&gt; enabling part. We cannot view the same thing as both Yin and Yang  
&gt; at the same time (we can talk about it in the abstract, in the same  
&gt; way that we can talk about Cartesian and polar coordinates  
&gt; together, and even transform them on in to the other), but the  
&gt; thing itself is both, and the transformations between Yin and Yang  
&gt; have a logical form that is predictable and determinate. Just so  
&gt; with restricting and enabling constraints -- we can learn to  
&gt; transform one into the other, both in thought and in practice.
&gt;
&gt; I will now demonstrate this with Jerry's cases (though the ideas  
&gt; are hardly peculiar to Jerry's cases)

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By &quot;genetic constraints&quot; I assume you simply mean that we have   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain capacities and are not omnipotent. Is not conflict and  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; war an  indicator of our individual failure to manage social  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complexity? Or  would you argue that war is social complexity  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; management?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was referring to the hypothesis that we have the propensity to  
&gt;&gt;&gt; function in relatively small groups bind by strong cultural bonds.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; From my perspective, enriched by chemical relations,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; genetic system serve as fundamentally creative activities.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Genetic networks are not an amalgam of soft concepts, rather a  
&gt;&gt; genetic network is a discrete interdependent network of chemical  
&gt;&gt; relations.
&gt;&gt; The enumeration of the creative  genetic network is complete for  
&gt;&gt; some organisms, some species.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In Aristotelian logical terms, the position of the species is  
&gt;&gt; between the individual &quot;point&quot; and the &quot;genus&quot;.
&gt;&gt; It is the chemical capacity to create species that I find to be  
&gt;&gt; absent from your narrative.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thus, I would re-phrase your  hypothesis generating sentence:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; From:
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was referring to the hypothesis that we have the propensity to  
&gt;&gt;&gt; function in relatively small groups bind by strong cultural bonds.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; To:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;I was referring to the hypothesis that genetic networks have the  
&gt;&gt; creative capacity to function in very large associations that are  
&gt;&gt; linked together by very weak bonds.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; There is no difference between the two statements -- the scope in  
&gt; the 'from' case is the Yang side of things, but in the 'to' case it  
&gt; is the Yin side. One pays attention to the Yang aspects, and the  
&gt; other to the Yin aspects. Both propensities are there, and the  
&gt; stronger the Yang propensity the more it transforms into the Yin,  
&gt; and vice versa. Given a finite information capacity, these are the  
&gt; only two possible dynamics, and they trade off against each other.  
&gt; Now, if we have an expanding information capacity (phase space), as  
&gt; Kaufman, Brooks and Wiley, Layzer, Landserg, Frautschi, Davies and  
&gt; other notables have seen, we can get both together, though they  
&gt; still trade off one against the other.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ted's comment seems to be based on a some recent innovations in  
&gt;&gt; the mathematics of hierarchies.  The issue of how we select the  
&gt;&gt; meaning for our symbols of representations of the world can be a  
&gt;&gt; very complicated one.  The profound limitations that linear and  
&gt;&gt; quasi - linear mathematics places on the symbolic carrying  
&gt;&gt; capacity of signs may be relevant to Ted's statement.  But, I am  
&gt;&gt; not certain of the origins of his views.
&gt;
&gt; Jerry, I think the way this is worded is not quite consistent with  
&gt; the perspective you are promoting. We don't &quot;select&quot; the meaning of  
&gt; our symbols, except perhaps in fairly formal contexts. If we did it  
&gt; would be very hard to be usefully creative, I am sure you agree --  
&gt; we could   only select what we already have a template for -- see  
&gt; my Dealing with the Unexpected from the CASYS meetings examples.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Stan's comment deserves to be attended to.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;The many
&gt;&gt; complexities facing us as society can be parsed as follows, using a
&gt;&gt; specification hierarcy:
&gt;&gt; {physical constraints (material/chemical constraints {biological
&gt;&gt; constraints {sociocultural constraints}}}}.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As I search for the substance in this comment, I  focus on what  
&gt;&gt; might be the potentially misleading usage of the term &quot;parsed.&quot;    
&gt;&gt; Nor, do I understand why brackets, signifiers of separations, are  
&gt;&gt; used in this context.
&gt;&gt; I have no idea what it would mean to &quot;parse&quot; a &quot;material /  
&gt;&gt; chemical constraint&quot; in this context.
&gt;
&gt; See note on W.E. Johnson above. That is the standard source for the  
&gt; logic here, and it is universally accepted among those who know it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Indeed, chemical logic functions in exactly the opposite direction.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The creative relations grow with the complexity of the system.  Is  
&gt;&gt; this not what we mean by evolution?
&gt;
&gt; But so do the constraints or restrictions, as Stan has been arguing  
&gt; for years now. There is no inconsistency in both happening.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; On a personal note to Stan: We have been discussing similar  
&gt;&gt; concepts since the inception of WESS more than 20 years ago and it  
&gt;&gt; does not appear that we are converging!  :-)  :-)  :-)    Unless  
&gt;&gt; you choose to embrace the creative capacities of chemical logic, I  
&gt;&gt; fear your mind is doomed to the purgatory of unending chaotic  
&gt;&gt; cycles, searching for a few elusive or perhaps imaginary &quot;fixed  
&gt;&gt; points.&quot;  ;-)  :-)        :-( !!!
&gt;
&gt; And there is no convergence. There are fixed points -- there have  
&gt; to be or all we can have is mush -- but they are not where the  
&gt; action is. On the other hand, the 'action' occurs only because of  
&gt; receptivity to  being worked on or guided by constraints that must  
&gt; relatively fixed. The divergence is there in reality, and the place  
&gt; where there is convergence is beyond our ability to grasp with an  
&gt; argument. I am sure that Stan knows this.
