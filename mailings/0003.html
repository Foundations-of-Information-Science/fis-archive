Dear Koichiro,
<br />
<p>let us begin our dialogue now! Is it information that is 'out there' 
<br />
or is it our (!) way of being, to be 'out there'? What does it mean 
<br />
'out there'? If there is 'objective information' it does not know 
<br />
nothing (as far as we now) from its being 'out there'. In other 
<br />
words, the condition of possibility of saying something is 'out 
<br />
there' is that the one who says 'out there' knows the difference (and 
<br />
makes this difference explicit) between being 'out there' and being 
<br />
'inside'. But in order to makes this difference one has to go (to be) 
<br />
&nbsp;beyond it, as it could never be possible to think about an 'out there' just from
<br />
an 'inside' that is not known as such (!). (Western) Philosophy has 
<br />
been asking itself for centuries about the possibility of the 'out 
<br />
there' and the question of a bridge (quaestio de ponte) between 
<br />
'there' and 'here'. In other words, information is 'out there' as far 
<br />
as everything has the possibility (!) for us (!) of being out there. 
<br />
The possibility of saying (!) something is 'out there' is a 
<br />
possibility given to us through language, as far as we can say: 
<br />
something 'is' (or 'is not'), and to broad-cast our 'casting'. This 
<br />
thesis seems to be an idealistic or anthropomorphic thesis 
<br />
(everything is 'dependent' on us), but it looks only so. It concerns 
<br />
only the way(s) we say things are (or the ways we 'constitute' or 
<br />
'construct' things), not their being 'independent of the knower' 
<br />
(that is again a sentence, and as such it says something about the 
<br />
way we see 'reality'). As far as I can see, your question has also to 
<br />
do with two interesting subject matters: what does it mean to 
<br />
'broadcast' a message? We need, I think, something we could call a 
<br />
theory of messages. And the second point is, what does it mean to 
<br />
talk about information in the present tense and in the present 
<br />
progressive tense. This last question concerns the relationship 
<br />
between message transmission and time. When talking about information 
<br />
without making the (human) difference between past, present and 
<br />
future, we get a specific form of information (or message) 
<br />
transmission. As you say, now journal would admit to be used as a 
<br />
broadcasting agency. This means, we have different ways of 
<br />
broadcasting messages, and different ways of relating them to time.
<br />
Kind regards, Sayonara
<br />
Rafael

Subject:       Information and Natural Languages
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this first posting of mine to fis&#64;listas.unizar.es,
<br />
I want to raise one point related to the issue of information
<br />
and invite any comments on it from our colleagues on the net.
<br />
That is about the relationship between what information is
<br />
all about and the capacity of our natural languages for the 
<br />
job.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If information is something out there, one might be able 
<br />
to talk about it in the mode of the present tense. Shannon's
<br />
information could be quite satisfactory for the purpose
<br />
because of its objectification in the form of information
<br />
bits. On the other hand, if information is related to some
<br />
process in progress, the corresponding linguistic vehicle 
<br />
must be in the mode of the present progressive tense. However,
<br />
statements in the present progressive tense are extremely
<br />
hard to be objectified in the usual sense of practicing 
<br />
sciences. No refereed journal would accept papers written
<br />
exclusively in the present progressive tense. A live
<br />
broadcasting of whatever game in the field from one station
<br />
cannot claim its objectivity, because it may quite likely
<br />
collide with similar live broadcastings of the same game
<br />
from other stations. At issue is how to reach the present
<br />
tense (to be objectified) from the present progressive 
<br />
tense (in the mode of a live broadcasting). 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Shannon's information is a legitimate 
<br />
enterprise on information practiced in the present tense.
<br />
If there is one more legitimate attempt for the matter of
<br />
information, that might be to precipitate the present tense
<br />
from the present progressive tense. How about its 
<br />
likelihood?
<br />
