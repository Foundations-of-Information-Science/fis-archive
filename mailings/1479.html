Dear Michel and Colleagues,
<br />
I was very interested, several weeks ago, in calculating the entropy 
<br />
associated with a certain distribution of energies among ideal gas 
<br />
molecules. Some of those energies are degenerate, and it seemed, at that 
<br />
time, that I must treat degenerate states as a single physical state, 
<br />
with a single probability for all of them. You seem to be saying the 
<br />
same, Michel. You wrote that For these latter, logical symmetries 
<br />
(degeneracy of states), and spatial symmetry (chambers) lead to decrease 
<br />
the combinatorial enumeration of the microstates, and thus there is an 
<br />
effect on the calculation of thermodynamical entropy.
<br />
But, research at our library, when I did my calculation, indicated 
<br />
otherwise. According to V. J. Emery, author of the article Quantum 
<br />
Statistical Mechanics in the Encyclopedia of Physics, The central 
<br />
concept in dealing with incomplete information is the microscopic 
<br />
definition of entropy or uncertainty introduced by von Neumann and by 
<br />
Shannon: S = -k Sum[p-sub-alpha log(p-sub-alpha)]....Notice that in all 
<br />
of these summations over alpha, every member of a set of degenerate 
<br />
levels is to be included. (page 994) I followed Emerys rule in my 
<br />
calculation. Does anyone dispute his prescription? What about you, Loet?
<br />
Id also like to reiterate, and, hopefully, reinforce my previous 
<br />
arguments that there is no difference between informational entropy and 
<br />
the entropy used by scientists to describe any other physical system. 
<br />
Though youve said thermodynamic entropy differs from informational 
<br />
entropy, Michel, a review of the literature seems to indicate this is no 
<br />
longer a distinction supported by scientific experts in this field.
<br />
Ill cite below some references to recent scientific work that, I think, 
<br />
make the argument decisively. Ive not been able to find any 
<br />
contemporary research from the literature which disputes the idea that 
<br />
informational entropy is actually physical (thermodynamic) entropy. Have 
<br />
I failed to find those results somewhere?
<br />
First, Id point to the really concise, copiously annotated, recent and 
<br />
decisive account given of the relationship between entropy and 
<br />
information written by W. T. Grandy, Jr. in Am. J. Phys. 65, 6, June 
<br />
1997, p. 466. This is a Resource Letter designed to provide scientists 
<br />
a very succinct, and comprehensive description of the history, 
<br />
development, and scientific results about a particular subject. Grandy 
<br />
lists more than 160 articles and books reaching as far back as 
<br />
Boltzmanns seminal paper of 1877. Its a great source for the entire 
<br />
history of the development of information theory and its relationship to 
<br />
entropy.
<br />
Grandy says the principle rigorous connection of information theory to 
<br />
physics (p. 468) is based on whats known as the principle of maximum 
<br />
entropy (PME), developed by Edwin Jaynes shortly after Shannon did his 
<br />
famous work. Grandy writes that one can now safely relate the 
<br />
theoretical (maximum) entropy to the fundamental entropy of Clausius. 
<br />
Quantum mechanically, one employs the density matrix, rho, and von 
<br />
Neumanns form of the entropy... (p. 469). Grandy doesnt equivocate 
<br />
about the equality of all these forms of entropy, does he?
<br />
I was first convinced that information is tangible, so that 
<br />
informational entropy is actually physical entropy, when I read one of 
<br />
Rolf Landauers papers from 1991. I expect that many of us know Landauer 
<br />
as the chief scientist at the IBM Watson laboratory in New York for more 
<br />
than twenty years, and source of Landauers Principle which may 
<br />
describe the entropy cost of erasing one information bit.
<br />
He wrote a short and relatively simple article titled Information Is 
<br />
Physical (Phys. Today, May, 1991, p.23) that argues, strangely enough, 
<br />
that information is actually physical. I still accept his discussion and 
<br />
conclusion. Does anyone dispute Landauers arguments? If not, I believe 
<br />
we must accept that the entropy of information is actually the entropy 
<br />
of a physical system. The same entropy we calculate for the operating 
<br />
fluid in an engine, for example.
<br />
Shu-Kun, are you willing to weigh in with your view on this topic? Ive 
<br />
been reading some of your articles on the similarity principle, and 
<br />
youve written that entropy in thermodynamics is a special kind of 
<br />
dynamic entropy. Do you believe there is a difference between 
<br />
thermodynamic and informational entropy?
<br />
Thanks, again, for this opportunity to express my understanding about 
<br />
these ideas, and to hear others views.
<br />
Cordially,
<br />
Michael Devereux
