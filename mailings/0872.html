<p>
Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>Following our discussion of the inadequacies of the current 
<br />
hypothesis on Cosmic Evolution on May 4, 2002, we posed a list of 
<br />
questions concerning the fundamental scientific issues  relating to 
<br />
the emergence of complexity.  During these discussions, we recognized 
<br />
that different individuals were proposing different concepts of time, 
<br />
matter, space and identity. The WESSbook sessions of June 8, 2002, 
<br />
September 21, 2002, October 12, 2002, and November 16, 2002 have 
<br />
revealed deep but perhaps spannable distinctions among our views.
<br />
<p>We will continue and perhaps close this initial series of 
<br />
explorations on Jan. 25, 2003 with presentations of views on the 
<br />
Nature of Energy.  The meeting begins at 12:00 PM in room 284 of the 
<br />
Reiss Science Building on the Georgetown University campus.  This 
<br />
session will be an &quot;open mike&quot; session for all participants under the 
<br />
guidelines given below.
<br />
<p>Volunteers are sought to give presentations on current views of this 
<br />
important component of scientific analyses and syntheses.
<br />
<p>The session will be divided into two parts, Early and Late.
<br />
<p>Volunteers for the &quot;Early&quot; part are requested to submit a title and 
<br />
several sentences describing their hypothesis on the nature of space. 
<br />
We hope to have three of four individuals from three or four 
<br />
different disciplines who can give substantial presentations on their 
<br />
views.
<br />
<p>&quot;Late&quot; speakers are invited to submit an email, including a proposed 
<br />
title, documenting their willingness to comment on the views of the 
<br />
&quot;Early&quot; speakers or to briefly develop another perspective of energy.
<br />
<p>Free discussion will follow the early and late speakers.
<br />
<p>Please volunteer at your earliest convenience. In order to schedule 
<br />
an orderly meeting and to notify other WESSbook participants, it is 
<br />
necessary to receive your title no later than Saturday, January 18th, 
<br />
2003.
<br />
<p>We will partition the available time democratically between the 
<br />
longer and the shorter talks.
<br />
<p>An open question:  Some have suggested that we apply our analyses of 
<br />
the fundamental concepts of science to a recent book of evolutionary 
<br />
interest.  How does a particular author generate a narrative that 
<br />
spans the basis of scientific thought with the recurring cycles and 
<br />
emergent itinerary of evolution?  Further suggestions of topics for 
<br />
the next session are welcomed.
<br />
<p>Plans for the Washington Academy of Sciences symposium, to be held in 
<br />
March, 2004 are progressing.  About 60 local scientific societies are 
<br />
invited to contribute to this gathering.  The symposium will provide 
<br />
WESS members an opportunity to present their views to a wide audience.
<br />
<p>Your comments on this proposal on the nature of energy and the 
<br />
potential for participation in the Washington Academy of Sciences 
<br />
symposium are welcomed.
<br />
<p>The volume of literature on nature of energy is substantial.  If you 
<br />
would like suggest relevant works on the nature of energy relevant to 
<br />
this WESSbook meeting, please distribute the suggestions directly to 
<br />
the recipients of this list.  Personally, I have found the works of 
<br />
Max Jammer (recommended by Ben Weems and available from Dover Books 
<br />
online) to be stimulating.
<br />
<p>As always, guests are welcome.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
