Dear Stan,
<br />
<p>In your last posting, you said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS:  Of course, the origin of the genetic system is arguably the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;outstanding problem facing natural science.  It seems that, other than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(to me) unconvincing RNA World idea, there is no compelling model of it.
</em><br />
<p>The model that the RNA (together with the DNA) is a sequence and that the
<br />
genetic mechanism copies the information from a sequence (the dna/rna) into
<br />
a nonsequenced assembly (the living organism) and from there (by means of
<br />
the ovaries and the testes) back into a sequence is a quite compelling
<br />
model.
<br />
<p>The term &quot;information&quot; has been shown in this chatroom to mean the cuts that
<br />
segregate, separate and distinguish summands;
<br />
The term &quot;sequence&quot; has been defined by Peano;
<br />
The term &quot;nonsequenced /=commutative/assembly&quot; is indeed hairy, as there
<br />
exists no definition for multidimensional partitions, although this is what
<br />
it means;
<br />
The term &quot;copies&quot; means a filter restriction on a set of entries into a
<br />
database (a restricted, in optimal case, bijective map between two
<br />
enumerations).
<br />
<p>So, we can say:
<br />
Genetic information management can be modelled by assuming that 
<br />
The information (the pattern of cuts on intervals)
<br />
In a sequence
<br />
Gets copied into
<br />
The information (the pattern of cuts on several intervals)
<br />
In a commutative assembly
<br />
And from there back.
<br />
<p>A mathematician would never go near or touch something that has no
<br />
definition. Contrary to a psychologist, who has a quite different attitude
<br />
towards things undefined. 
<br />
Even, if a logical entity behaves in a fashion that it is not possible to
<br />
say by rational words what it is, we can count its differing subtypes. In
<br />
the Middle Ages, they maybe counted different aspects of witchcraft or
<br />
aurification. It is legitimate to count differing appearances of a thing
<br />
even if we do not know what the thing is; as long as we can distinguish two
<br />
different kinds of that something. And that we can distinguish two differing
<br />
multidimensional partitions (e.g. sociograms) is an obvious truth. 
<br />
By counting distinguishable appearances of a logical entity we do not know
<br />
the exact nature of, we can establish its logical width, domain, complexity.
<br />
In the present case, we only need to know how many different kinds of
<br />
multidimensional partitions exist, not what they are in reality.
<br />
<p>In reality, and this answers the other question in the post:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I know of no scientific principle that allows 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for ANY analogous entity in nature, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;save humans, to store its structural information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;digitally on a specific kind of molecular template.
</em><br />
What one means by the term &quot;multidimensional partitions&quot; appears to be the
<br />
cut pattern on the set. We have spoken about the cuts separating two similar
<br />
units generating the basis of our present counting system, N. They are
<br />
thought as unit as we think the unit to be of unit properties, that is,
<br />
alike to any other unit.
<br />
We overlook the existence of the diversity of the cuts. If we think the cuts
<br />
as extremely unit like as we think the units unit like, there remains no
<br />
space for the diversity property of the opposite of the similarity.
<br />
We end up like a partial judge who listens only to the one side. Yes, our
<br />
counting system is based on similarity. So what is it opposed to? Who
<br />
represents the interests of those who are defined irrelevant? 
<br />
The cuts have differing heights and numbers. We should not force them to be
<br />
in the same - similarity based - logical picture as that they are the
<br />
enemies of. The cut is the mortal enemy of the continuation, and it succeeds
<br />
in discontinuing our perception. (We do not go, after all, as consequently
<br />
to the end in asserting similarity as to say that everything is one and
<br />
without any interruption.)
<br />
We do accept the existence and the relevance of the cuts, but we really do
<br />
not recognise their legal right to be there and to be counted in their own
<br />
facon d'etre. 
<br />
Once you start co-employing the cut patterns alongside the texture, the
<br />
mechanism will become apparent, by which only such sequences can exist,
<br />
where the cut pattern agrees to the cut pattern on the heap of textile. The
<br />
key element in the mechanism is the individuating power of the symbols
<br />
employed, and that boils down again to diversity, that is how diverse are
<br />
the logical units we use to describe the world with.
<br />
It is a long and detail-rich seminar one needs in order to re-educate
<br />
himself on using diversity alongside similarity. The FIS chatroom may not be
<br />
in its intention such, so we cannot go more in details here. But please let
<br />
me keep the chance to maintain the belief that the model - compelling to me
<br />
- that our logic has heretofore not been sufficiently complex to describe
<br />
the most basic method of densifying information, namely that of writing and
<br />
rewriting it from a sequence into a commutative assembly and back, by
<br />
employing symbols that individuate in differing extents. We can increase the
<br />
complexity of our logic by co-employing the heretofore neglected aspect of
<br />
the properties of the cuts and their patterns. This makes the counting
<br />
system itself more exact as a self-referencing instrument by the factor of
<br />
0.3E-96; it allows size-independent logical and numerical statements; it
<br />
generates numerically comparable levels and densities of logical truth; it
<br />
connects the units of the counting levels &quot;logical relation&quot; and &quot;object&quot;;
<br />
it employs logical archetypes with properties that are enumerated in a
<br />
numbering system, of which the basic units are the fillup limits of the
<br />
electron layers.
<br />
<p>So, there are quite many and well-founded arguments for assuming that indeed
<br />
there appears to exist a logical answer to the great question of natural
<br />
science, how genetics functions, and that this is a model to which
<br />
reasonable and sober people can say this is a convincing, say compelling
<br />
model.
<br />
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to advertise the
<br />
sequential-commutative-sequential mantra, which is identical to the
<br />
similar-diverse-similar mantra.
