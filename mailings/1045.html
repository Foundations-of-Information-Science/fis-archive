<p>
Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>This message responds to Karl's message (copied below).  I bring up 
<br />
some philosophical issues in hopes of stimulating some of the 
<br />
biologists and philosophers to consider the semantic problems 
<br />
associated with this particular area -- trans disciplinary 
<br />
communication within the informational sciences.
<br />
<p>Karl, thank you for your efforts in response to my example with NAD 
<br />
(Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).)
<br />
<p>Please note that the standard representation of a chemical 
<br />
(molecular) formula includes both chemical symbols and number or 
<br />
mathematical symbols.  Both classes of symbols are necessary to 
<br />
convey the empirical facts about the ratio of chemical elements 
<br />
present.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From a semiotic point of view, the meaning of each chemical symbol is 
<br />
well defined and unambiguous.  Each chemical element represents a 
<br />
concept of a specific class of matter.  Each chemical element as a 
<br />
class of matter is not a single factor or a single concept, rather it 
<br />
represents a set of properties which includes a dozen or more 
<br />
interrelationships associated with the concept.  For example, the 
<br />
symbol Au represents not only the verbal concept (word) of gold, but 
<br />
also such properties as density, electrical conductivity, thermal 
<br />
conductivity, electrochemical equivalence, electron work function, 
<br />
specific heat  and so forth.  In addition to these empirical 
<br />
properties, gold also represents a concept within the ordering 
<br />
relation of chemical elements.  In this addition role, it is 
<br />
represented by the atomic number 79.
<br />
<p>In contrast to the diversity of the empirical properties of gold, 
<br />
consider the mathematic concept of a set and the relation with 
<br />
number.
<br />
<p>Both set and number are abstract concepts.  As such, different 
<br />
opinions exist on the meaning of these concepts.
<br />
<p>Examination of standard textbooks on logic and set theory reveal the 
<br />
following definitions:  ( The concept of set is an artificial 
<br />
construct, it was invented by G. Cantor about 1870.)
<br />
<p>1. &quot;According to his definition a set S is any collection of definite 
<br />
distinguishable objects of our intuition or of our intellect to be 
<br />
conceived as a whole.  The objects are called the elements or members 
<br />
of S.&quot;  (Stoll, Set Theory and Logic, 1979)
<br />
<p>2. &quot;Axiomatic Set Theory.  The basic character of this theory are as follows:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. propositional functions are taken extensionally, ie, they 
<br />
are are identified when they have always the same truth values.for 
<br />
the same arguments.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. propositional functions of more than one argument can be 
<br />
reduced to to functions of one argument, i.e., classes;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. there is a class whose elements are called sets such that 
<br />
a class cane be an element of another if and only if the former is a 
<br />
set.&quot;
<br />
Curry, Foundations of mathematical Logic, 1976.
<br />
<p>3. &quot;A set can be defined as by a characteristic property that is 
<br />
possessed by every element of the set but not possessed by any object 
<br />
that is not an element of the set.&quot; Stolyar, Introduction to 
<br />
Elementary Mathematical Logic, 1971.
<br />
<p>We can ask the following questions about the chemical elements and 
<br />
numerical elements:
<br />
<p>1. What are the references for the two concepts, chemical element and 
<br />
set theory element?
<br />
<p>2. What are the empirical relations that tie the two concepts together?
<br />
<p>3. When can the concept of a chemical element symbol be substituted 
<br />
for a mathematical element symbol?
<br />
<p>4. How is it possible to substitute a chemical element symbol into a 
<br />
mathematical function?
<br />
<p>5. When will a string of chemical symbols be considered to be 
<br />
&quot;ordered&quot; in the sense of ordering of the natural numbers?
<br />
<p>6. Under what circumstances can a multi-conceptual concept such as 
<br />
that of a chemical element be entered into a syllogism of the type 
<br />
used for numbers or classes of sets?
<br />
<p>These questions are raised because of their fundamental relationship 
<br />
to chemical and biological communication and the the necessity for 
<br />
creating correspondence relationships between semantic concepts, 
<br />
chemical symbols, and mathematical symbols.
<br />
<p>To illustrate what I mean, I quote from an earlier paper:
<br />
<p>&quot;The semiotic dilemma is exemplified by noting that the terms 
<br />
organic, organism and organization are all derived from the same 
<br />
root.&quot;  (Chandler, Information Processing in Cells and Tissues.1998).&quot;
<br />
<p>It is well known that the relationship between physical methods and 
<br />
mathematical representation and operations have co-evolved. 
<br />
Remarkable cross-fertilization between the two disciplines.  While a 
<br />
potential cross fertilization between chemical methods and 
<br />
mathematics may be possible, the logical foundations for such a cross 
<br />
fertilization have not yet evolved.
<br />
<p>Now, to Karl's specific interpretation of my example:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your concrete question translates into marketing-speak as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).  Six of the 21
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;carbon atoms are optically active.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Give me the well-and-classical archetypical inhabitant of the market: he/she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comes in two varieties (he/she), equipped with 14 credit cards, has 7 living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relatives, meets weekly 21 other persons and spends money on 27 differing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occassions in the period. Six of the spending social interactions happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with cash.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This being the most common member of the market, this lemming shall be the
</em><br />
most easily observable unit.
<br />
<p>I point out the following problems in trans-disciplinary communication:
<br />
<p>1. NAD is a specific chemical structure.  It is a specific geometric 
<br />
relation (in crystal form) among 71 &quot;atoms&quot; bound together as a 
<br />
whole.  It is a single member (a single isomer) of a very large class 
<br />
of structures with the same chemical composition.
<br />
<p>2. NAD, as a chemical structure, is a stationary object. (Time is not 
<br />
represented in the formula.)
<br />
<p>3. 67 of the 71 atoms occupy unique chemical positions and thus form 
<br />
separate subclasses.
<br />
<p>4. The critical role of multiple optical isomers is specific to 
<br />
chemical language and seldom plays a role in normal language.
<br />
<p>5. Karl correctly notes the distinction between the symbol of the 
<br />
class and the number of class members, but misses completely the 
<br />
uniqueness of the individual components within the class.
<br />
<p>6. The introduction of statistical distributions is apparently an 
<br />
essential part of Karl's method; it is purely gratuitous from the 
<br />
perspective of chemical structure.
<br />
<p>Among the defining attributes of life are the specificity of 
<br />
relations and the sensitivity of these relations in time and place. 
<br />
Karl's method appears to miss these attributes in this example.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From a philosophical perspective, Karl (and Michael?) appear to 
<br />
assume a neo-Kantian view of mathematics.  Or, perhaps, even 
<br />
neo-Platonic.  Karl's views could also be classified as almost 
<br />
Pythagorean.  As group theory is often viewed as an application of 
<br />
set theory, the remarks about the definitions of sets are relevant to 
<br />
Michael's mathematical explication of music.
<br />
<p>Underlying my concerns is direct question:  How does one create a 
<br />
narrative that is consistent with the empirical facts, the scientific 
<br />
correspondence relations and the structures of mathematics?
<br />
<p>In my opinion, the chemical sciences (chemistry, biology and 
<br />
medicine) are closer to Aristotelian categories and Liebnizean logic.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
<br />
<p><p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi folks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jerry has given me a well-circumscribed task. Thank you for the opportunity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to discuss modeling of theoretical chemistry as a stochastical process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The task is (here comes what Jerry wrote):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Karl, my favorite molecule is known as NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dinucleotide).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It structural formula is H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).  Six of the 21
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;carbon atoms are optically active.  The NAD molecule includes five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;covalent rings, three aromatic and two aliphatic.  (See an elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;biochemistry textbook for the exact structure.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Karl, can you demonstrate how your approach would generate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;particular biological isomer of NAD that is common to all living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;organisms?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The answer is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We return to my last communication in this matter:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What comes out of the deeper investigation of mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that are parts of a set (that gets partitioned according to stochastic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principles) is, that there appear KINDS or TYPES or ARCHETYPES of (clusters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of) objects. These can be compared to the physical and chemical objects that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the natural scientists refer to when they speak of &quot;entries in the periodic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;table of elements&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You take a sufficiently big set (somewhere between 32 and 97, for some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obscure number theoretical reasons), make subsets on it and will see that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there appear kinds, types or archetypes of objects that are definitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;present. You cannot avoid meeting these.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you understand sociology and market research, you will understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in any city, in any culture, in any field research, if you ask more than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;few dozen people, you will have types of answer collections. There will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some &quot;really average&quot;, &quot;rather average&quot; and &quot;slightly off-stream&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;eccentric&quot; types, characters, kinds or archetypes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you understand this, you have understood the periodic table of elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as truth values of a multidimensional partition table of a sufficiently big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jerry, you have to visualise the periodic table of elements as a truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;table. (So far, a truth table has been taught at Computers I for freshmen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with following essence:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(1) there are 2 constants: .t. and .f..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(2) combinations of logical sentences build up a truth table
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(3) Sentence A .t. .AND. sentence B .t.: A .and. B = .t. ; A .or. B = .t.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(4) Sentence A .f. .AND. sentence B .t.: A .and. B = .f. ; A .or. B = .t.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(5) Sentence A .f. .AND. sentence B .f.: A .and. B = .f. ; A .or. B = .f.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please look up the current way of putting this. A truth table describes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical truth of some combinations of logical sentences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now the invention:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The undersigned (that is me, Karl Imre Javorszky) has extended the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a truth table to include more dimensional combinations of logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentences. There are not only 2 possibilities for a logical value to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow, but more. The idea is to use the .t. and .f. values to denote the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;is included in a subset of size ....&quot; logical fact. This leaves you in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fashion with the same old .t. and .f. values, but there are more of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and they are at the second look not all exactly the same worth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The undersigned has introduced the concept of multidimensional truth tables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by using statistical, stochastical methods that are taught at Marketing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Economics, Statistics, Sales, Sociology, Social research and the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;faculties, but also for freshmen. I hope that a professor for theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chemistry can apply methods of Marketing I.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In Marketing I one learns to segment the market. The market is viewed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;segmented for people who sell. They know that they don't target the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;market but a segment of it. They say &quot;segment&quot; and what they mean is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;subset&quot;. It is called correctly a subset but one does not always use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correct name for it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So they segment the market - in their words. If they would want to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about what they do with mathematicians, they would say that they partition a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set. They do the same but don't say it in the same fashion. They partition a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If they want to sell to middle-aged, divorced women or to self-employed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;professionals in small towns, they generate multidimensional partitions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They just don't say so, because it is a complicated business and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematicians like to wait up until it is clear they really have to work a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We agree that marketing does use multidimensional partitions. (Ask a dealer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in e-mail addresses whether he can subsegment the set into mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exclusive subsets and generate overlaps according to your wishes.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now the BIG INVENTION: (so far there was no real invention, just looking up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what other people do.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the set is big enough, there shall be always such a segment (subset) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the most probable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Meditate on this and you shall have great rewards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your concrete question translates into marketing-speak as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).  Six of the 21
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;carbon atoms are optically active.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Give me the well-and-classical archetypical inhabitant of the market: he/she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comes in two varieties (he/she), equipped with 14 credit cards, has 7 living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relatives, meets weekly 21 other persons and spends money on 27 differing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occassions in the period. Six of the spending social interactions happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with cash.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This being the most common member of the market, this lemming shall be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most easily observable unit. Why, computer artists will draw you the traffic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulation based on the most probable behaviour of the most probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inhabitant. Why they can't (or won't, because the definitely could) do this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for a more abstract inhabitant, I don't know. (Saying: now show me the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probable social group size for the most probable inhabitant during the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probable period of time, while you let the city grow in size.) But this is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;psychological question of why people don't find the answer if they are paid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for looking everywhere for that elusive answer. Would you research yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out of your job?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ask your friendly neighbourhood mathematician what must happen until someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shall define the term multidimensional partition. Everyone uses them but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematicians. &quot;Not defined&quot; - it is like in socialism used to be: &quot;not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the party rules&quot;, therefore it does not exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hope to have helped you a bit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Cheers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Karl
