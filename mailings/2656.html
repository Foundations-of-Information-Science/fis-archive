                    <br />
                <p>Arne, I think you are hopelessly sinking into experiential quicksand
                    <br />
                    on this issue of &quot;reality.&quot; It is entirely too easy, indeed
                    <br />
                    gratuitous, to say that no reality could not possibly exist because
                    <br />
                    it is OUT THERE and we are IN HERE. You may as well attack the
                    <br />
                    experiential individual's need for a symbolic language, which puts
                    <br />
                    him even further into that quicksand. But, in the face of this dire
                    <br />
                    situation, we fortunately have science to lift us from that
                    <br />
                    threatening swamp of experiential primacy. Without science, we sink
                    <br />
                    subjectively, don't we? Without an objective reality we would have
                    <br />
                    to resort to those experiential shadows on the wall that go back to
                    <br />
                    Plato's cave and beyond.

                    <br />
                    me to be that liquid crystalline micelles gave rise to some kind of
                    <br />
                    proteinid microspheres, and -- here is the problem these somehow came
                    <br />
                    to acquire what we know as the genetic system.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Stan, this is close to the rub I perceive, which concerns the
                    <br />
                    emergence or adoption or implantation or miraculous insertion, you
                    <br />
                    name it, of a digital language with a symbolic dictionary that can be
                    <br />
                    stored and communicated by cells in a linear format we come to
                    <br />
                    recognize as genetic information. I cannot even tacitly assume that
                    <br />
                    those analogous crystalline micelles somehow had the organizational
                    <br />
                    ability to evolve a digital (non-analogous) language to communicate
                    <br />
                    the &quot;instructions for life.&quot; By what principle? This requires
                    <br />
                    analog-to-digital transcriptionï¿½a big no-no for neo-Darwinian
                    <br />
                    modelers. The only principle I know of that ever allowed this to
                    <br />
                    naturally occur also stipulates that value-added requirement of
                    <br />
                    humans consciousness. Any model of the origin of genetic
                    <br />
                    &quot;instructions for life&quot; leaves a big black box where that apparently
                    <br />
                    marvelous adaptation occurred. And I don't know how invoking a
                    <br />
                    hierarchical schema will get me where I think I to need to go. Seems
                    <br />
                    to me that too many things run parallel without adequate consideration.

                    the most basic method of densifying information, namely that of
                    <br />
                    writing and
                    <br />
                    rewriting it from a sequence into a commutative assembly and back, by

                <p>So, there are quite many and well-founded arguments for assuming that

                    <br />
                    there appears to exist a logical answer to the great question of natural
                    <br />
                    science, how genetics functions, and that this is a model to which
                    <br />
                    reasonable and sober people can say this is a convincing, say compelling
                    <br />
                    model.

                <p>Thank you for the opportunity to advertise the
                    <br />
                    sequential-commutative-sequential mantra, which is identical to the
                    <br />
                    similar-diverse-similar mantra. &quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Karl, this is interesting to me. Maybe the principle I seek is your
                    <br />
                    &quot;sequential-commutative-sequential mantra.&quot; I'm sure you know that
                    <br />
                    it is not friendly to Crick's central dogma, but that may not mean it
                    <br />
                    is necessarily wrong. Just exactly how this principle is implemented
                    <br />
                    by a &quot;liquid-crystalline micelle&quot; (Stan) is not made clear to me by
                    <br />
                    invoking the S-C-S mantra. It merely says that genetic information
                    <br />
                    can be written and rewritten. But how? By natural selection or
                    <br />
                    random genetic drift? Maybe. But this does not explain the origin of
                    <br />
                    a coded genetic language.
