                    Dear All,
                    <br />
                <p>My apologies once again for not being able to keep up with the day-to-day
                    <br />
                    exchanges. I've gone back over last week's postings and assembled the

                    </em><br />
                <p>Stan, I most assuredly do not eschew final cause. Rather, I wish to posit
                    <br />
                    final cause in the domain of some agency. I don't see agency per-se in the
                    <br />
                    action of the second law. The second law is what happens in the absence of
                    <br />
                    agency.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In particular, I see in autocatalysis a &quot;self-entailing&quot; aspect
                        that is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;not derivative of any associated gradient in energy (or exergy, to be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;more exact.)
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; SS: So autocatalysis can occur without any energy input?
                    </em><br />
                <p>Certainly, autocatalysis doesn't occur in the absence of energy input, but
                    <br />
                    the input doesn't drive the autocatalysis in the same determinate way that
                    <br />
                    is common among non-living systems. To be more specific, autonomous
                    <br />
                    systems engendered by one energy gradient are capable of switching to
                    <br />
                    other gradients. We see that all the time in ecology and economics. The
                    <br />
                    final cause is not to be found in the energy gradient, but rather in the
                    <br />
                    &quot;centripetal&quot; behavior that is a hallmark of autocatalytic behavior (and
                    <br />
                    life) itself.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is an opposing tendency, attributable mostly to the action of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;autocatalysis (and the partial autonomy thereof) that acts in almost
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;dialectical fashion against entropy.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; SS: My take is that this works WITH the Second Law. Indeed, since
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; all gradients are unstable to metastable, they all must be dissipated.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Autocatalysis, and any building-up tendency, is simply parasitic upon
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; this necessary dissipation.
                    </em><br />
                <p>I wouldn't agree. I can conceive of gradients existing for indeterminate
                    <br />
                    time without being dissipated. That's why we had fossil fuels. Human
                    <br />
                    society, which arose out of the solar gradient, for reasons vested in its
                    <br />
                    own autocatalytic economy, sought out and switched to fossil fuels to
                    <br />
                    serve those ends. Fossil fuels didn't force themselves upon humans, nor
                    <br />
                    did they beckon to humans simply to be dissipated (some current wasteful
                    <br />
                    human activities notwithstanding. :)

                <p>Igor, I am certain you are better schooled in dialectics than I am. It's
                    <br />
                    just that I have trouble conceiving of nothingness as agency (which may be
                    <br />
                    what you are saying?) I look for either an enduring, stable constraint or
                    <br />
                    an active agency as that which pulls the system forward. It is difficult
                    <br />
                    for me to ascribe agency to the ever-widening abyss, but maybe I'm not
                    <br />
                    enough of an absurdist or existentialist?

                <p>I am sympathetic to the drift of Viktoras' questions to Stan on Fri, 6
                    <br />
                    May. Note as how economists and social scientists are not encumbered with
                    <br />
                    the same taboos that guide biologists. Direction and intention are very
                    <br />
                    natural phenomena in their domain. Biologists label it &quot;epiphenomenal&quot;,
                    <br />
                    i.e., without real effect. As Carl Sagan remarked at the end of his
                    <br />
                    segment from Cosmos that dealt with evolution, after dwelling for an hour
                    <br />
                    on dinosaurs and other forms, &quot;These are some of the things that MOLECULES
                    <br />
                    do!&quot; I agree with physicist George Ellis that intentionality is a very
                    <br />
                    real phenomenon that can exert true agency, and the sooner we come to
                    <br />
                    terms with that fact, the better for science.

                    <br />
                    magnitudes? If so, this is a time-honored and trustworthy endeavor (called

                    dimensional analysis.) Except that a mere majority doesn't usually carry

                    <br />
                    fact that efficiency isn't the whole story. In fact, when it comes to
                    <br />
                    persistence, it is subordinate to reliability. By choosing a good plot,
                    <br />
                    one is sure to include both efficiency and reliability into the mix.

                    Aleks said. In my (possibly naieve) view, most of what is said in set
                    <br />
                    theory is ripe for re-interpretation in terms of networks as well. Then
