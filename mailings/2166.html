                <p>
                    Dear Pedro,
                    <br />
                <p>Given that the definition of information we seek should broadly be
                    <br />
                    stated in English as &quot;that which informs&quot; by which we mean that which
                    <br />
                    identifies cause - that we, as sentience entities, may capture, analyze
                    <br />
                    and make predictions from. Then the simple general notion that
                    <br />
                    &quot;difference&quot; is information is a sound basis for the notion in the
                    <br />
                    physical realm - at all levels of complexity.
                    <br />
                <p>The shift between the complex and the non-complex systems of information
                    <br />
                    comes from our underlying theories of nature that allow us to interpret
                    <br />
                    difference. Gravity is my favorite example here where we see a clear
                    <br />
                    progression of interpretation from Galileo through Newton to Einstein -
                    <br />
                    all founded essentially on the same observable differences.
                    <br />
                <p>Falsification plays a central role in moving us from one interpretation
                    <br />
                    to another - and it is because Newton's theories are falsifiable that we
                    <br />
                    can readily accept Einstein. Einstein's theories explain more of the
                    <br />
                    observable differences - IOW &quot;they have greater consistency with the
                    <br />
                    available information.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>The theory of Evolution is informed by observable differences at a level
                    <br />
                    of greater complexity - and it can be seen that science makes the same
                    <br />
                    mistakes as it did between Newton and Einstein. It is the underlying
                    <br />
                    premise that alters the interpretation of apprehended information.
                    <br />
                <p>So, on reflection, I can be quite happy with extending the simple
                    <br />
                    difference model I laid out earlier as the fundamental definition of
                    <br />
                    &quot;that which informs&quot; if we allow that all apprehended information in
                    <br />
                    semeiosis demands models of interpretation (the basis of Analysis) to
                    <br />
                    provide us with embodied knowledge and truth (the embodied experience of
                    <br />
                    the map between what we know and the way things are).
                    <br />
                <p>The basic physical definition of &quot;information&quot; holds despite our
                    <br />
                    apprehension and there is no conflict in moving from the animate to the
                    <br />
                    inanimate.
                    <br />
                <p>The formal metaphysical question then becomes how we analyze and express
                    <br />
                    our apprehension and interpretation - and this is no longer a question
                    <br />
                    of the definition of information but now one of analysis, communication
                    <br />
                    and convention, by which we build consensus in formal deliberation.
                    <br />
                <p>It is in this context that my proposed quantification of and role for a
                    <br />
                    primitive of experience apply - we simply cannot correctly interpret the
                    <br />
                    available information without it. This premise and the formal operator
                    <br />
                    &quot;experience-of&quot; essentially add the basis of complexity to current
                    <br />
                    convention and moves us toward a place for experience in our formal models.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, clearly these models of interpretation that exist as the result of
                    <br />
                    semeiosis do, in the common sense of the word, inform - they do assist
                    <br />
                    us, in semeiosis, to &quot;identify&quot; cause - and it may be here that
                    <br />
                    clarification is required - since this usage of the terms is a &quot;category
                    <br />
                    error&quot; by the above reasoning.
                    <br />
                <p>With respect
                    <br />
                    Steven
                    <br />

&gt; Resilient FISers,
&gt;
&gt; Let me expand, again, on some biological and social-economic matters 
&gt; related to below (John), and also to Steve, Hans, Marcin...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ... The nature of meaning is the great object of desire for 
&gt;&gt; information theory. Within the scope of meaningful, or semantic 
&gt;&gt; information, is intentional information, or cognitive content. At the 
&gt;&gt; next level of restriction is social information, though some authors 
&gt;&gt; hold that cognitive content depends on language, which is a social 
&gt;&gt; activity...  So rather than a single definition of information, I 
&gt;&gt; suggest we work more towards a unification of the theory of 
&gt;&gt; information, otherwise there will be no science of information as such.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If we relate meaning not only to human language but also to &quot;life&quot;, as 
&gt; most biosemioticians would agree, we could ask what differential 
&gt; traits of biomolecular networks lead to a new type of dynamics that 
&gt; allows eg, a Bayesian behavior --anticipatory respect the coming 
&gt; &quot;states&quot; of the system-- that bona fide appears only in living matter. 
&gt; Theoretically, perhaps, the cellular construction of meaning 
&gt; throughout emergent properties of molecular networks has not 
&gt; attracted  a lot of attention ---not a glamorous big question, such as 
&gt; the &quot;red herring&quot; of consciousness. But  several aspects of the new 
&gt; studies (particularly in network analysis, in signaling systems, and 
&gt; in proteomics, even in systems biology) might help to achieve a new, 
&gt; clearer picture of what &quot;meaning&quot; may consists of at the cellular 
&gt; realm. At least, having the next discussion session on biomolecular 
&gt; networks might represent a nice occasion of making some initial 
&gt; advancement into that &quot;terra incognita&quot;. Apart from the classics, what 
&gt; new formal constructions could be of help into that task (eg, Steve's 
&gt; suggestions, or Karl's, or Bayesian views, or Michael Leyton's ones?
&gt;
&gt; Overall, my contention is that we have a lot of new &quot;informational&quot; 
&gt; thinking ahead, necessarily including science, society and economics. 
&gt; Some of the basic abstractions of science concern the ways and means 
&gt; by which individual thought overcomes its own limitations of time, 
&gt; space, and &quot;intensionality&quot; (Stan), so that the little piece of 
&gt; knowledge can be accepted into the collective repository of a 
&gt; scientific &quot;discipline&quot;. But once we insensibly accept anyone of these 
&gt; regimented regimes, the ecumenical vision of info we aspire dissolves 
&gt; into the provincial one... it will be dizzy until we frame our own 
&gt; &quot;supradisciplinary&quot; way of thinking.
&gt;
&gt; In our economy-centered societies, we do not interpret &quot;signals&quot; sent 
&gt; from the marketplace &quot;invisible hand&quot; but in a rudimentary 
&gt; quasimechanistic way --away from equilibrium, would say a neoclassic. 
&gt; As we do not see the &quot;informational&quot; commonality of enterprises and 
&gt; living beings, being constantly changing, with additions and deletions 
&gt; of components, where the stability at any moment depends on the 
&gt; importance of a given &quot;signal&quot; ingoing or outgoing from the momentary 
&gt; structure. Being informational means keeping always the own structure 
&gt; in-formation... as the cell does (and not as computers do!).
&gt;
&gt; Thanking the patience,
&gt;
&gt; Pedro
