Dear Rafael, Stan, and others,
<br />
<p>In reply to Rafael:
<br />
<p>The thread entitled &quot;Consilience and Structure&quot; has exposed a &quot;disilience&quot; 
<br />
(to use Rafael's term) between two major philosophical schools of thought. 
<br />
I am referring to the gulf between the so-called analytical tradition in 
<br />
philosophy and continental philosophy.  I was trained in the analytical 
<br />
tradition, and was discouraged from reading continental philosophers such as 
<br />
Heidegger and Husserl.  A philosophy department in the English speaking 
<br />
world typically has at most one professor out of 25 (in my case) who 
<br />
specializes in continental philosophy.  It is clear that continental 
<br />
philosophy has had a huge influence on the foundations of information 
<br />
science as it is being discussed by many people in this group.
<br />
<p>I make no judgment about things I do not know.  In fact, I happen to think 
<br />
that analytical philosophy needs infusion of ideas from other sources.  But 
<br />
the institutional obstacles that serve to isolate the two major 
<br />
philosophical schools remain in place--namely, that the rewards (funding, 
<br />
publication, prizes) are controlled by one's peers within each camp.  I 
<br />
don't see this institutional fact is a good thing, but it's not going to 
<br />
change anytime soon.  I would imagine that everyone in this group has paid a 
<br />
price for their effort to break down artificial interdisciplinary 
<br />
boundaries.
<br />
<p>One person can't do everything, so I know that I will never find the time to 
<br />
make a serious effort to understand continental philosophy, no matter how 
<br />
convinced I am that it would pay intellectual dividends.  It would not 
<br />
advance my career in the short term.  I do my bit for the cause by making an 
<br />
effort to bread down the communication gap between working scientists and 
<br />
analytical philosophers.  I am already paying a price for that.
<br />
<p>The bottom line is that I'm unable to respond to Rafael's ideas because I 
<br />
know next to nothing about continental philosophy.  Just so that you know.
<br />
<p>In reply to Stan:
<br />
<p>I didn't know that birds apparently have four color cones.  But it sounds 
<br />
plausible given the co-evolution of colorful fruits and flowers are in part 
<br />
&quot;designed&quot; to attract birds.  On the other hand, it sounds wrong to conclude 
<br />
that &quot;What there is in the world is a mutual construct between external 
<br />
objects and a system of interpretance that interacts with those objects.&quot; 
<br />
It seems mysterious to say that the way that any organism perceives the 
<br />
world changes the world itself.  It changes their perception of the world. 
<br />
It changes the relationship between the world and the organism.  But there 
<br />
is only one world.
<br />
<p>In the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn made similar claims 
<br />
about paradigm shifts in science (using the analogy of the duck-rabbit 
<br />
visual gestalt).  He claimed that a paradigm shift literally changes the 
<br />
world in which a scientist lives.  On a weak reading, Kuhn is merely 
<br />
claiming that scientists working in different paradigms see the same world 
<br />
differently.  Under a stronger reading, Kuhn is saying that &quot;What there is 
<br />
in the world is a mutual construct between external objects and a system of 
<br />
interpretance that interacts with those objects.&quot;  That is, there are many 
<br />
worlds.
<br />
<p>In analytical philosophy, the many-worlds doctrine is known as relativism. 
<br />
I oppose relativism because it denies a fundamental consilience: I prefer 
<br />
the one-world viewpoint because it is conceptually more parsimonious and 
<br />
equally consistent with the facts.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
Malcolm

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably the question you are asking has something to do with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (conceptual/philosophical) problem of defining what are 'relations'. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you take a look at Heidegger's Being and Time § 17, you will find there a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion with Husserl's idea of 'relations' (in German: Beziehungen) as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a formal concept for all kinds of connections between things. Digns and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their 'relations' are, following Heidegger, a universal characteric of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of things but we should not follow from this that all relations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Beziehungen) are necessarily of the kind of relations Heidegger calls 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reference' (in German: Verweisung).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I quote Heidegger showing the complexity of the concept of sign:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Among sings there are symptons, warning signals, signs of things that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have hapened lready, signs to mark something, signs by which things are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recognized; these have different ways of indicating, regardless of what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be serving as such a sing. From such 'signs' we must distinguish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traces, residues, commemorative monuments, documents, testimony, symbols, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressions, appearances, significations. These phenomena can be easily be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalized because of their forml relational character; we find it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially tempting nowadays to take such a 'relation' as a clue for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjecting every entity to a kind of 'Interpretation' which always 'fits' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because at bottom it says nothing, no more than the facile schema of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content and form.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sentence was published in 1927, long before semiotics (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cybersemiotics). It can be considered as a criticism of the universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim of semiotics. Heidegger is making the point by making a difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the kind of universal kind of relation he calls 'relation' and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of relation he calls 'reference'. This last one is confined to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena analyzed by Heidegger as being &quot;ready-to-hand&quot; i.e. to phenomena 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as we deal in everyday life (also in a scientific/technical set) by using 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things as tools and organizing them within a wordly environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The difference our retina makes could be interpreted then as a difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the retina that 'reacts' at the light in the sense of a 'reference' and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not, as expected, in the sense of an objective frame of reference or as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'relation'. The reason for this is the retina has an 'internal stance' (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 'pragmatic' way of doing with 'signs') as Koichiro would say, and that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have both, an internal and an external stance of sings as 'relation' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and as 'reference'. The question concerns them the foundational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between both. Heidegger argues that although relations are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal, this kind of universality (Koichiro's external stance) is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction with regard to the 'narrower' or 'pragmatic' view of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reference'. Signs as 'reference' imply the kind of existential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'pragmatic' envolvement that makes things understandable by situating them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within a (familiar) wholeness of references (and significances). I wonder 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if our retina is 'reacting' so to speak automatically, within such a whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of references, before our (scientific) mind starts making the universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflection of sings and what they 'mean'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheers
</em><br />
