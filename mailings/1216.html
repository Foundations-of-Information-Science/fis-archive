Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>This message seeks to address some of the discussion points during 
<br />
the past few weeks on &quot;Ecological Economics and Information&quot;.  These 
<br />
comments are terminal only in the sense that our allocated time has 
<br />
expired.  Facets of this discussion will continue as components of 
<br />
numerous other facets of the FIS agendas.
<br />
<p>Personally, I remain humbled by the breadth of this topic.  I stand 
<br />
in awe of the perplexity of nature. 
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../wires.news.com.au/special/mm/030811-hubble.htm">http://wires.news.com.au/special/mm/030811-hubble.htm</a>&gt;<a href="../../wires.ne/default.htm">http://wires.ne</a> 
<br />
ws.com.au/special/mm/030811-hubble.htm
<br />
<p>Perhaps I can best reflect on the discussions by quoting from my 
<br />
opening remarks on Oct. 23, 2003:
<br />
-----------------
<br />
&quot;In earlier work (Chandler, NYAS,vol. 879, 75-86, 1999, vol. 901, 
<br />
75-85, 2000)  a suitable classification of systems was developed. The 
<br />
proposed classification is organic.  That is, a degree of 
<br />
organization is used to distinguish among components.  The chemical 
<br />
basis of the classification provides a natural relation with 
<br />
biological systems without discarding the concept of distance.  The 
<br />
organic basis of the scale, grounded in the atomic numbers of the 
<br />
chemical elements, provides an intrinsic meter for counting and for 
<br />
accounting of relations in terms of semantic names of components.  It 
<br />
is a simple, direct scientific classification that separates 
<br />
components on the basis of the degree of organization rather than 
<br />
linear distance or arithmetic operations .
<br />
<p>&quot;The categories are:
<br />
<p>O° 1 subatomic particles
<br />
O° 2 chemical elements
<br />
O° 3 molecules
<br />
O° 4 biomacromolecules
<br />
O° 5 cells
<br />
O° 6 organs
<br />
O° 7 individuals
<br />
O° 8 populations
<br />
O° 9 ecosystems
<br />
O°10 planet
<br />
<p>&quot;The objective of this categorization is not to give a theory of 
<br />
everything.  Rather the objective is to provide a basis for 
<br />
reflection on the structure of scientific languages and the potential 
<br />
for relations among these scientific languages in nature. Other 
<br />
categorizations can add finer structures to the distinctions.   Each 
<br />
degree of organization provides a &quot;home&quot; for a collection of terms 
<br />
and scientific theories.  Frequently, individual terms may be used in 
<br />
multiple layers or stages or hierarchical levels or degrees of 
<br />
organization. The multiplicity of usages generates a polysema that 
<br />
strongly influences communications among different scientific 
<br />
subdisciplines. Usage of a term in multiple degrees of organization 
<br />
introduces uncertainty.
<br />
-----------------
<br />
<p>The categorization of natural systems into 10 distinctive classes is 
<br />
a value laden classification, deeply grounded in a natural synthesis, 
<br />
a natural materialism, a natural organization by scale, a natural 
<br />
structure. (I am indebted to De Chardin, Bergson, Whitehead and the 
<br />
chemical sciences for suggesting this structuring of categories.)
<br />
<p>The value laden categories listed above are not independent from one 
<br />
another.  Indeed, the categorization is a particular form of 
<br />
opposition to the highly simplistic but mathematically elegant 
<br />
concepts of independence, linear independence, linear vector spaces 
<br />
and so forth.
<br />
<p>The value laden categories relate relate to one another via a path of 
<br />
dependencies, not independence.  Each enumerated &quot;degree of 
<br />
organization&quot; emerges from the one below, except the first and the 
<br />
last.
<br />
<p>It is now widely acknowledged that the dependencies among these 
<br />
categories are intrinsic to a natural value system, a natural value 
<br />
system which supports the continuing emergence of ever more perplex 
<br />
systems with iterative enfoldings of dependent categories within one 
<br />
another.  Such is the natural history of our planet.  The concept of 
<br />
&quot;mathematical independence&quot; remains a powerful tool for the design, 
<br />
analysis and synthesis of artificial systems. (By artificial systems 
<br />
I mean engineered systems -- computers, spaceships, automobiles and 
<br />
other machines of all sorts designed for human purposes.)  But the 
<br />
role of &quot;independence&quot; in *Mother Nature* herself remains to be 
<br />
elucidated.
<br />
<p>Historically, humans have generated an amazing array of philosophical 
<br />
beliefs which relate the dependencies of language to the dependencies 
<br />
of nature.  Perhaps A. N. Whitehead captured central concept about 
<br />
relationships when he writes in Process and Reality:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;p. 9.  &quot;The field of a special science is confirmed to one genus of 
<br />
facts, in the sense that no statements are made respecting facts that 
<br />
lie outside that genus.  The very circumstances that a science has 
<br />
naturally arisen concerning a set of facts secures that facts of that 
<br />
type have definite relations among themselves which are obvious to 
<br />
all mankind.&quot;
<br />
<p>p. 11.  &quot;Every science must devise its own instruments.  The tools 
<br />
required for philosophy is language.  Thus, philosophy redesigns 
<br />
language in the same way that, in a physical science, re-existing 
<br />
appliances are redesigned.  It is at exactly this point that the 
<br />
appeal to facts is a difficult operation.&quot;
<br />
<p>p. 12. &quot;The technical language of philosophy represents attempts of 
<br />
various schools of thought to obtain explicit expressions presupposed 
<br />
by the facts of experience.&quot;
<br />
<p>The bridge between natural categories and abstract thought is 
<br />
grounded in abstract symbol systems.  We humans have created a range 
<br />
of symbol systems -- numbers, alphabets, chemical symbols, musical 
<br />
notations, economic symbols, medical symbols and so forth.  It 
<br />
appears that all symbol systems originated in natural language. 
<br />
Symbols are integral to human communications.  During the course of 
<br />
our discussions, individuals have invoked various symbol systems, 
<br />
often with value laden connotations in order to express (represent) 
<br />
concepts related to our topic.  I wish now to comment on some of 
<br />
these relations among abstractions.
<br />
<p>In his post of Dec. 11, 2003, Loet communicates a philosophy of mathematics:
<br />
<p>&quot;For example, the distribution 1/2 + 1/2 contains one bit of information,
<br />
independent of whether it is about coin flipping or anything else.&quot;
<br />
<p>I am puzzled on how one would fit chemical philosophy into such a 
<br />
mathematical philosophy.  Chemistry philosophy is grounded on ratio's 
<br />
of small whole numbers and neither nuclei or electrons can be 
<br />
distributed into &quot;1/2 + 1/2&quot;.  Loet's post suggests that we need to 
<br />
look carefully at how the marketing of information is tied to simple 
<br />
mathematical operation of addition.
<br />
<p>In his post of Dec. 13, 2003, Sergio writes of his philosophy of 
<br />
thermodynamics:
<br />
<p>&quot;Exergy (&quot;the amount of work obtainable when some matter is brought 
<br />
to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium with the common components of 
<br />
the natural surroundings by means of reversible processes, involving 
<br />
interaction only with the above mentioned components of nature&quot;, 
<br />
Szargut et al., 1988) measures the physical and chemical 
<br />
&quot;information&quot; of an item in relation to its conversion into useful 
<br />
work (mechanical, electric, etc). Since exergy refers to reversible 
<br />
processes (and real processes are never reversible), it states very 
<br />
clearly an upper limit to the work obtainable and allows a 
<br />
sustainability assessment mainly focussing on the way resources are 
<br />
used and on what can be obtained from them (i.e. an user-side 
<br />
sustainability). Of course, we are not talking here of the exergy of 
<br />
a person or a standing tree, since exergy is not sensitive to life 
<br />
(using Luis' words). Herefore, we do not use exergy to measure the 
<br />
work of an artist or the complexity of a flower or fruit (as Enzo 
<br />
also pointed out).&quot;.
<br />
<p><p>I am puzzled by the meaning of this passage.  Where is the 
<br />
correspondence between the mathematical symbols and the natural 
<br />
system?   In what sense is the concept of thermodynamic work to be 
<br />
restricted to a subset of nature that excludes life?  Can we identify 
<br />
a rigorous boundary that suffices to distinguish  biological work 
<br />
from mechanical work?    Or, does the problem lie in the mathematical 
<br />
presuppositions that thermodynamic variables are bilinear relations 
<br />
that permit a small subset of additive relations?
<br />
<p>Pedro starts to address this issue when he writes:
<br />
<p>&quot;Initially, most of living matter is composed by polymers of enormous 
<br />
lenght, thermodynamically pretty unusual, for all of those reactions 
<br />
imply an entropy decrease.  Who pays for that evident entropy 
<br />
decrease? It is enthalpy, the other player in the Gibbs free energy 
<br />
of almost every biological reaction--bigger, far bigger 
<br />
quantitatively, around one order of magnitude, or even two in most 
<br />
reactions within the living. The famous DNA polymer, for instance, 
<br />
repeating a eloquent saying by GR Desiraju (2003) is but &quot; a 
<br />
manifestation of mutual recognition, a storage device for structural 
<br />
information, and a victory of enthalpy over entropy&quot;.&quot;
<br />
<p>Pedro's remark clearly identifies an economic source of biological 
<br />
organization and growth.  This source is well known in the 
<br />
biochemical literature, with extensive discussions since the 1950's. 
<br />
Of course, in simple systems, the concept of enthalpy is seldom 
<br />
linked with time.  However, in perplex systems which are regulated by 
<br />
internal enfoldings of dynamics, enthalpy is is a function of the 
<br />
existing network of relations and hence of time.
<br />
<p>Pedro continues:
<br />
<p>&quot;The many (and factually incommensurable) dimensions of the social 
<br />
body: cultural, political, moral, religious, nationalistic, racial, 
<br />
esthetic, hedonistic, etc., steer our global trajectory in very 
<br />
strange ways--irrational ones quite often.&quot;
<br />
<p>But, Pedro, can we stop at this point in the analysis?
<br />
What are the informational consequences of incommensurate dimensions?
<br />
At what points in the list of categories does nature become 
<br />
incommensurate with herself?  Or is it we humans who have constructed 
<br />
artificial systems of thought that lack commensurability?
<br />
<p>In thinking of these matters, I am reminded of Michael Leyton's 
<br />
sweeping conclusions on the relations between mathematics, music and 
<br />
mind.  If I can roughly paraphrase Michael's logic in terms of 
<br />
Quine's universal structure for logical statements, it ran something 
<br />
like this:
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;If musical notation is a natural harmony of the mind and if in 
<br />
mathematical group theory begets music, then mathematical group 
<br />
theory begets mind.&quot;
<br />
<p>Such simple equivalences are attractive  for internal mental 
<br />
abstractions about human thought but elide the external world of 
<br />
material, chemical and neurological facts.  In addition, I am deeply 
<br />
skeptical that all of Mother Nature can be made commensurate by the 
<br />
single operation of group theory.  I am equally skeptical that two 
<br />
operations of addition and multiplication in a linear vector space 
<br />
are sufficient to construct a coherent view of Mother Nature.  I 
<br />
suggest that we need an extension to our conceptualization of 
<br />
&quot;operation&quot; in order to give an accounting of information flows in 
<br />
living and higher order systems in economies and ecologies.
<br />
<p>In closing, the time, energy and thoughts of the individual 
<br />
contributors to this discussion are gratefully acknowledged. 
<br />
Undoubtedly, these topics will continue to fascinate us in the coming 
<br />
years!
<br />
<p>Best Wishes for the Holidays.
<br />
<p>May everyone enjoy the fruits of their labors throughout the New Year!
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
