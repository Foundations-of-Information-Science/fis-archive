                <p>
                    Dear All
                    <br />
                <p>I will try to reply in shorter &quot;chunks&quot; to avoid the indigestion reading
                    <br />
                    syndrome:
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro: Although in recent years several Nobel prizes have gone to studies on
                    <br />
                    information in markets, asymmetries, agents, etc., and all the boom of the
                    <br />
                    &quot;knowledge engineering&quot; paradigms in management practices, the coherence of
                    <br />
                    the infoeconomic doctrine looks far from been established. If would be nice
                    <br />
                    if Igor or other colleagues highlight the pros and cons of those basic
                    <br />
                    approaches and how they fare particularly regarding the possibilities of
                    <br />
                    the ecological economics school (how could human networks by means of their
                    <br />
                    inclusive economic-ascendancy internalize the information needed to
                    <br />
                    evaluate a &quot;silent&quot; ecological network?).
                    <br />
                <p>Igor: neoclassical economics and neoliberal politics argue that
                    <br />
                    internalization of information needed to evaluate a &quot;silent&quot; ecological
                    <br />
                    network comes primarily from the market/price system. Ecological economists
                    <br />
                    disagree and propose multidimensional scale analysis, like, for example,
                    <br />
                    Multiscale Integrated Assessment of Societal Metabolism (MSIASM) of Mario
                    <br />
                    Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi. Other, like Robert Costanza, tried to evaluate
                    <br />
                    immaterial aspects of nature (mostly its service and sink functions) in
                    <br />
                    monetary terms in order to show that vast amounts of value (and information)
                    <br />
                    lie outside the market/price system, and cannot be easily incorporated into
                    <br />
                    it. Still other believe that ethical dimension is indispensable in
                    <br />
                    internalizing successfully information coming from ecosystems - first we
                    <br />
                    must value nature per se in order to able to perceive and process
                    <br />
                    information coming out of it. And so on... basically there is no (and cannot
                    <br />
                    exist) a single way as how modern societies may internalize ecological
                    <br />
                    information. I think that both objective (scientific knowledge) and
                    <br />
                    subjective (values and beliefs that we share about nature) dimensions are
                    <br />
                    indispensable. At present we lack both, although some progress has been
                    <br />
                    accomplished in the past two decades. This discussion is surely making a
                    <br />
                    step in that direction, and I am happy to learn new things and approaches.
                    <br />
                <p>James: This makes for new relations not
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to traditional mathematical treatments but to new socially
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interdynamic ones. And it is the control of asset decision-rights
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that rests at the heart of public/global economic dynamics; including
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights to access any accruable/eventual benefits.
                    <br />
                <p>Igor: control of asset decision-rights is very important in understanding
                    <br />
                    the dynamics of economic networks and its effects on ecological networks.
                    <br />
                    Some &quot;nodes&quot; in the economic network are not simply larger than others but
                    <br />
                    wield economic and political power which cannot be accounted for in standard
                    <br />
                    measurement of flows (material, monetary, or energy). This non-transparent
                    <br />
                    feature of economic networks calls for caveats when we wish to apply
                    <br />
                    traditional mathematical or computer modeling methods. Unfortunately, this
                    <br />
                    &quot;grey&quot; power often plays a key role in the unfolding of events that we later
                    <br />
                    call history. The problem of asset control and decision-rights over land,
                    <br />
                    air sea etc. is implicit in all sorts of problems that come under the name
                    <br />
                    of the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;. It was also important in the
                    <br />
                    industrialization of Western Europe where new rules regarding land ownership
                    <br />
                    and land use, practically drove thousands of &quot;suddenly landless&quot; to the
                    <br />
                    cities where they served as an energy input to the new autocatalytic loop of
                    <br />
                    factories.
                    <br />
                <p>The very best
