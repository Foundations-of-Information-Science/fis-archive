Dear Koichiro,
<br />
<p>sorry for the delay. I will be on vacations the next weeks but I 
<br />
wanted to make some comments on your ideas concerning the 
<br />
relationship between time and information. I had yesterday an 
<br />
interesting talk on this matter with my colleague Wolfgang von Keitz. 
<br />
I give you shortly some of the results:
<br />
1) If we are observing soemething that is growing very very slowly (or even 
<br />
stable: a fossile) with regard to my lifetime then I can disregard my 
<br />
lifetime and we get something like an objective (Newton) time (I can 
<br />
use for instance the perfect tense) (frozen time).The quality of my 
<br />
prognose is good. At the other end of the scale I have propositions 
<br />
being done in the present tense, where there is almost no possibility 
<br />
of prognostic. This is the case of, for instance, historical 
<br />
propositions and, indeed, of human sciences. Things are changing 
<br />
continuously and we get something like a quasi-sychronicity. No 
<br />
objectivity is possible. The amout of possible errors (concerning the 
<br />
prognostic) is BIG :-)
<br />
2) But if Newton-Time is only a fiction, and if not only human and 
<br />
life sciences but even (Quantum) Physics is aware of the relativity 
<br />
of the time parameter then I get that truth is time dependent and 
<br />
information also. Time must be constructed. This is an obvious case 
<br />
when we deal with phenomena where time is an essential component. But 
<br />
the aim of classical (Newton) science was finally to avoid (or 
<br />
disregard) time. If you discard time, then the quality of your prognose 
<br />
is very good!
<br />
3) What about introducing causes in time (during the processes)? Does 
<br />
it make possible a better prognose? This is the point where I see the 
<br />
concept of information understood as the _causa formalis_. I think 
<br />
that modern science disregard this sort of causality taking into 
<br />
account only the _causa efficiens_ . The _causa formalis_ allows only a relative 
<br />
prognose, as I do not know exactly what the effect of the 
<br />
'in-formation' processes will be.
<br />
4) Due to this situation and if we do not take the elimination of time 
<br />
but time-phenoma as a basis for observation then we have to be aware 
<br />
that with new qualitative forms (or in-formations) also the kind of 
<br />
form (or informations) varies.
<br />
5) Ancient Greek philosophy (Plato, Aristotle) considered forms 
<br />
(eidos, idea) as the culmination (or realization, _energeia_) of 
<br />
potential being (_dynamis_). The question is, as Heidegger in _Being 
<br />
and Time_ states, whether potentiality is 'higher' than actuality. In 
<br />
this case forms or not a culmination but a kind of horizon of 
<br />
possible developments (not just, as Plato thought, a copy of an 
<br />
eternal original). 
<br />
6) When you then ask for the possibility of translating present tense 
<br />
observations (local time) to a kind of observations that allow a more 
<br />
secure prognose, then we have, I think, different possibilities:
<br />
- either we work with _ceteris paribus_ clauses
<br />
- or we take into account the _causa formalis_ and can do only a very 
<br />
defficient prognose (take, for instance, economics!)
<br />
- or, in case we are at the human level, we have to take into 
<br />
explicit accout the way(s) we construct time, i.e. our being aware of 
<br />
the difference between past, present and future and of the influence 
<br />
of the timely (!) observer on his/her observations (see Quantum 
<br />
Physics).
<br />
7) In _Being and Time_ Heidegger considers the 'turning over' 
<br />
(_Umschlag_) from the practical being in the world to the theoretical 
<br />
one. I think that this can help (me) to clarify your question. The 
<br />
practical is not opposed to the theoretical, but it is included, 
<br />
althoug in a non-thematical way, in it. In a similar way we could say 
<br />
that the 'turning over' into an objective (time disregarding) view of 
<br />
the phenonema comes out of a previous time-related description.
<br />
Winograd and Flores have made useful this distinction with regard to 
<br />
the way a computer scientist looks at a software (the objective view) 
<br />
and the way a user views the software (the practical view).
<br />
8) Finally I will like to remember that the human observer is an 
<br />
observer capable of language. I think this is a  v e r y basic 
<br />
distinction with regard to all other kinds of observers. Language 
<br />
allows us (among others) to see things under different perspectives 
<br />
_as such and such_. This _seeing as_ was a basic discovery of Greek 
<br />
philosophy (Aristotle's _on he on_= being as being). Although we have 
<br />
tried to fix the _as_ for instance in Kant's transcendental subject, 
<br />
we see now, under an evolutionary perspective, that there are no such 
<br />
a priori structures and that 'forms' are perspectives of world 
<br />
constructions (possibilities more than actualities).
<br />
9) My last point: If we learn to see evolution under the causation 
<br />
through information then we get less a continuum than a discontinuum, 
<br />
and it remains open to new 'fulgurations' (as Popper and K. Lorenz 
<br />
call the new emergences). We loose some prognostic, but we come near 
<br />
to how things (probably) happen.
<br />
At the human level this means that we orient our actions not only by 
<br />
thinking a kind of objective time but by considering the right 
<br />
moment, Greek _kairos_, and can 'explain' thus historical events by 
<br />
reflecting on this. Not only _know yourself_ (_gnothi sauton_) but 
<br />
also _kairon gnothi_ (know the right moment) was one of the famous 
<br />
'dicta' of the 'seven wise men' in Greece.
<br />
Kind regards, sayonara
<br />
Rafael

<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafael's concern
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;trying to get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more deeply in the understanding of your concern about the present 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tenseand the present progressive tense etc. 
</em><br />
<p>has actually straightened me up. Let me try to say what I want to 
<br />
say in a plain language, though I don't know whether I could 
<br />
succeed.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My starting point is this: Any dynamic behavior in progress
<br />
is descriptively in the mode of the present progressive tense.
<br />
Dynamics starts from the present progressive, no matter how 
<br />
awkward it may look. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the present progressive tense can 
<br />
allow behavioral agents other than the author who decribes it. 
<br />
Imagine, for instance, I am walking through a crowd as avoiding 
<br />
collisions with other people. Then, I can see that other people 
<br />
are doing the same. That is, I am walking through the crowd as 
<br />
collisions with other people being avoided. The statement of 
<br />
my waliking in the present progressive tense makes others beside
<br />
myself active agents, also. Of course, they are active observers.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that if we still adhere to the practice of 
<br />
describing any dynamics in the present tense, it will be 
<br />
required for us to construct a bridge between the present 
<br />
progressive and the present tense. One candidate for this is 
<br />
via the present perfect tense. If the presence of globally 
<br />
perfected movement is guaranteed, global synchronous time as an 
<br />
attribute of the presence can serve as a reference against which 
<br />
statements in the present tense are made possible. Such a 
<br />
global synchronous time can have a static attribute and can be 
<br />
parameterized accordingly. When I talked about the presence of 
<br />
perfected movement in the above, a hockey puck sliding on an ice 
<br />
rink almost frictionlessly was in mind. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more candidate approaching the present tense is via the 
<br />
past progressive tense. Since the past progressive tense can 
<br />
already be in the record, it has to satisfy the principle of the 
<br />
excluded middle. What is needed for the transference from the 
<br />
past progressive to the present tense is the presence of the 
<br />
activity for fulfilling the principle. When I was walking
<br />
through the crowd as avoiding collisions with other people,  
<br />
the avoiding activity has successfully been conducted up to the 
<br />
point the record has been registered, though the walking has not 
<br />
yet been perfected. My walking yet to come is going to avoid 
<br />
collisions with other people, since walking and colliding exclude 
<br />
each other. Local time associated with the presence of the local 
<br />
activity for fulfilling the principle of the excluded middle is
<br />
definitely involved in the synchronization with other local time
<br />
in the nehborhood because the principle extends towards the entire
<br />
discourse. But, no global synchronous time is available. What is 
<br />
possible instead is a delayed or skewed scynchronization at best,
<br />
the latter of which is quite difficult to be decipered in terms of
<br />
global synchronous time.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a rough sketch I have now. What concerns me is 
<br />
the relationship between the issue of information and local time
<br />
as a local activity based upon the grammatology of our ordinary 
<br />
languages. How about that?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
