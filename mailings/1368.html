<p>
Dear all (especially John and Stan)
<br />
<p>My interpretation of Peirce ontological theory of mind is also based on
<br />
this important quote that Jesper points to below. But let me add a few
<br />
others from an article I just finished for Axiomathes.
<br />
<p>&quot;Far less has any notion of mind been established and generally
<br />
acknowledged which can compare for an instant in distinctness to the
<br />
dynamical conception of matter. Almost all the psychologists still tell
<br />
us that mind is consciousness. But &#x2026;unconscious mind exists. What is
<br />
meant by consciousness is really in itself nothing but feeling. &#x2026;there
<br />
may be, and probably is, something of the general nature of feeling
<br />
almost everywhere, yet feeling in any ascertainable degree is a mere
<br />
property of protoplasm, perhaps only of nerve matter. Now it so happens
<br />
that biological organisms, and especially a nervous system are favorably
<br />
conditioned for exhibiting the phenomena of mind also; and therefore it
<br />
is not surprising that mind and feeling should be confounded. &#x2026;that
<br />
feeling is nothing but the inward aspect of things, while mind on the
<br />
contrary is essentially an external phenomenon.&quot;(Peirce, CP: 7.364.)
<br />
<p>Thus, the essence of consciousness is feeling and an important aspect of
<br />
Firstness is pure feeling. From a Peircian framework with its synechism,
<br />
you have to admit that the universe is permeated with Firstness, but
<br />
that is not the same thing as human awareness (though it is the origin
<br />
of it). Peirce writes.
<br />
&quot;What the psychologists study is mind, not consciousness exclusively. &#x2026;
<br />
consciousness is a very simple thing. &#x2026;not&#x2026;Self-consciousness &#x2026;
<br />
consciousness is nothing but Feeling, in general, -- not feeling in the
<br />
German sense, but more generally, the immediate element of experience
<br />
generalized to its utmost. Mind, on the contrary is a very difficult
<br />
thing to analyze. I am not speaking of Soul, the metaphysical substratum
<br />
of Mind (if it has any), but of Mind phenomenally understood. To get
<br />
such a conception of Mind, or mental phenomena, as the science of
<br />
Dynamics affords of Matter, or material events, is a business which can
<br />
only be accomplished by resolute scientific investigation.&quot;(Peirce, CP:
<br />
7.365)
<br />
<p>Peirce is not speaking of human self-consciousness but of the essence of
<br />
consciousness as a phenomenon that develops in nature to emerge in new
<br />
and more structured forms in living beings, nervous systems and
<br />
language-based culture. Peirce writes about this concept of thought,
<br />
understood as a function of mind and semiosis:
<br />
<p>&quot;Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the
<br />
work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world; and
<br />
one can no more deny that it is really there, than that the colors, the
<br />
shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Not only is thought in the
<br />
organic world, but it develops there. But as there cannot be a General
<br />
without Instances embodying it, so there cannot be thought without
<br />
Signs. We must here give &quot;Sign&quot; a very wide sense, no doubt, but not too
<br />
wide a sense to come within our definition.&quot;(Peirce, CP: 4.551)
<br />
<p>Here Peirce is widening the semiosis concept to include chemical
<br />
pattern-creating processes as nature's thinking. I would prefer to call
<br />
these proto- semiotic processes to avoid a too broad sense of the
<br />
concept leading into a pan-semiotic metaphysics. But, nevertheless,
<br />
Perice's metaphysics operates with the &quot;inside&quot; of material nature. He
<br />
writes:
<br />
<p>&quot;Wherever chance-spontaneity is found, there in the same proportion
<br />
feeling exists. In fact, chance is but the outward aspect of that which
<br />
within itself is feeling.&quot;(Peirce, CP: 6.265)
<br />
<p>Chance, spontaneity and feeling are connected to Firstness that forms
<br />
the basic and vague link between everything. However, from a biosemiotic
<br />
view, it does not develop into genuine signs before organized into
<br />
living cells. To see the habits or laws of nature as signs in themselves
<br />
for the Universe, you have to construct the Universe as a subject. That
<br />
would be a subject so abstract that it would be far beyond ordinary
<br />
human comprehension.
<br />
<p>The basic philosophical problem is whether in a Peirciean framework you
<br />
can have Thirdness without sign quality. If you want to make the
<br />
universe in itself an interpreter the answer is no. But, from a
<br />
biological perspective, what we call signs and semiosis are working
<br />
within quite different space and time frames. It is true that Peirce
<br />
wrote that &quot;the universe is perfused with signs&quot; and that he looks at
<br />
matter &quot;as effete mind&quot; and finally, his Synchistic doctrine connects
<br />
mind with matter and sees mind as continuity and semiosis. He further
<br />
sees &quot;the one original law to be the recognized law of mind, the law of
<br />
association, of which the laws of matter are regarded as mere special
<br />
results&quot; (Peirce, CP: 6.277). Peirce writes the following that can be
<br />
seen as essential to his contribution to a theory of mind:
<br />
<p>&quot;Hence, it would be a mistake to conceive of the psychical and the
<br />
physical aspects of matter as two aspects absolutely distinct. Viewing a
<br />
thing from the outside, considering its relation of action and reaction
<br />
with other things, it appears as matter. Viewing it from the inside,
<br />
looking at its immediate character as feeling, it appears as
<br />
consciousness. &#x2026;remember that mechanical laws are nothing but acquired
<br />
habits, like all the regularities of mind, including the tendency to
<br />
take habits, itself; &#x2026;this action of habit is nothing but
<br />
generalization, and generalization is nothing but spreading of
<br />
feelings.&quot; (Peirce, CP: 6.268)
<br />
<p>If we cannot have Secondness and Thirdness in nature without
<br />
interpretants being established, then every stable entity in the
<br />
universe has to be considered a sign, and there are no objects to refer
<br />
to. Even if dyadic relationships are almost always embedded in the
<br />
triadic mediating force of Thirdness and final causation, they must be
<br />
considered to have independent existences. To make sense, in Peirce's
<br />
metaphysics, and to be compatible with the work done in the sciences, we
<br />
must primarily view the laws of nature as objects in themselves.
<br />
I do not want to conceptualize the idea of natural laws in any
<br />
transcendental way. Apart from the law of mind, Peirce sees them as
<br />
immanent. In modern scientific language one would say that they emerge
<br />
out of the symmetry breaking that is generated by the cooling of the
<br />
universe.But under the law of mind and habittaking.
<br />
<p>This is the view I am challenging Stan on. Do we share this and if so
<br />
what are the consequenses for his thermodynamic view and criteria for
<br />
establising interpretants? 
<br />
<p>Sorry for the length!  Soren

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi, Stan, Søren and John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just dumping in on the latest exchanges: As you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know I am neither a Peirce scholar or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosopher, but it seems to me that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following quote from the 1891 paper in the Monist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The Architecture of Theories&quot; points to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological interpretation of the law of habit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking as I prefer to call it (because people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invariably identifies mind with human mind, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was definitely not what Peirce had in mind):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In the beginning - infinitely remote - there was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a chaos of unpersonalized feeling, which being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without connection or regularity would properly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be without existence. This feeling, sporting here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there in pure arbitrariness, would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started the germ of a generalising tendency. Its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other sportings would be evanescent, but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have a growing virtue. Thus, the tendency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to habit  would be started; and from this, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other principles of evolution, all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities of the universe would be evolved.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Peirce 1931-35) CP 6.33).

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;The problem I am raising is that according to Peirce pure feeling as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstness is there from the beginning and as such internally in matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;and energy - and so is the law of mind. But you seem to build up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;hierarchy in a fairly physicalistic way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;With all due respect, Søren, this is a controversial issue in Peirce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;scholarship. The consensus on Peirce-L is that Firstness is a mode
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of being, but that it cannot exist on its own, since existence arises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;only with Secondness. After that, various people tend to disagree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;about the roles of the two. Peirce's few remarks on Hegel, with whom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;he agrees in some respects, and distances himself in others, probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;need to be investigated closely to get any further than two alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;views that Firstness is both ontologically and logically prior to Secondness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;or that it is not ontologically prior. Peirce's texts seem to support both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;interpretations, according to the discussions on Peirce-L. As I understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Stan, he would accept the logical primacy of Firstness, as being required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;by Secondness, but not its ontological primacy as being able to exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without Secondness. The &quot;law of mind&quot;, it seems to me to apply to logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;primacy (the possibilities) and not ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;primacy (existence). So I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that Stan's interpretation is consistent with what we currently know about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;interpretation of Peirce. It seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the coming of mind into existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;could occur much later than the primal being of its possibilities (laws, if
