<p>
Dear Fis,
<br />
<p>The recent postings are highly charged. We are cooking up something in this
<br />
community. James has again taken the dialectic role of the advocatus diaboli
<br />
as he says:
<br />
&quot;First hole -- no one has a glimmer of a notion to -explain- gravity ... not
<br />
'describe it' .._explain it/account for it_.&quot;
<br />
So then, here is the challenge to debate a logical picture of gravity.
<br />
Translating everything and all into the language of probability yields many
<br />
fruitful results. There appear lots of natural constants, levels,
<br />
thresholds, and the like. The force concept dissolves into a process of
<br />
prediction, where what was force before is now an expected exactitude of a
<br />
prediction. 
<br />
What gets predicted is the steps in a neighboured world, where the
<br />
neighbourhood steps furcate (contrast, divide, dissimilarise) the collection
<br />
of logical relations happening on a set of n objects. 
<br />
There is an inner imbalance in the collection of logical relations that are
<br />
there on a set of n objects, because we cannot agree, how to count: the
<br />
units as individuals or as members of groups. The average extent of the
<br />
disagreement could be that what the physicists mean by &quot;quantum&quot;. 
<br />
The imbalance allows predicting. In case there are 2 (two) schwerpunkte on
<br />
the set of logical relations, it is easy to visualise a constant dialectic
<br />
two-and-fro between two halves of something. The two systems of counting
<br />
come from the fact that we count the uniformity of the units as we conduct
<br />
an addition and we count the diversity of the summands as we deconduct an
<br />
addition. Those additions that keep alive after being deconducted, too,
<br />
constitute reality 1. How dense they are, how they are structured, what are
<br />
their statistics, this is what Contrast Theory details.
<br />
Gravitation := prediction ( place ) .
<br />
The term &lt;prediction&gt; refers to neighbourhood steps in a sequence. A
<br />
sequence is a consecutive enumeration. Steps are detailed in structure
<br />
theory. Structure theory is the description of the cuts that keep apart the
<br />
summands of an addition. The description happens by means of the logical
<br />
descriptors &lt;how&gt; and &lt;how many&gt;. These are axiomatic, because one who
<br />
discusses gravitation knows how to distinguish and how to count.
<br />
Neighbourhood is the result between the matches between &lt;how&gt;, &lt;how many&gt;
<br />
and &lt;where&gt;. &lt;where&gt; is logically axiomatic, too, because one cannot count
<br />
indistinguishable objects without distinguishing their places. Their
<br />
interdependence is what makes the contrastal counting so pretty useful. 
<br />
The place argument of a prediction is the result, if the quality and the
<br />
quantity arguments are more fixed. On the other hand, the quantity appears
<br />
to be nothing but a simple dimension, one among many, that are neighboured
<br />
each according to its own facon. 
<br />
The density swarm of logical relations has two mass points. The opposing
<br />
views are dialectically: &quot;the extent of uniformity is the unit&quot; and &quot;the
<br />
extent of diversity is the unit&quot;. 
<br />
Good, so you say, dear Fis, but what has this to do with gravity? The
<br />
following: 
<br />
Our generations extended use of counting machines has allowed us to be more
<br />
exact than our forefathers. We have established that the average addition is
<br />
inexact to the tune of some 10 to the minus 95th power in percents. This
<br />
inexactitude is the average extent of the logical rounding error we commit
<br />
by saying a+b=c. We neglect something as we conduct and addition. This
<br />
something - the just noticeable difference of that it could have been
<br />
otherwise, regardless of what and how -, keeps apart the background and the
<br />
foreground, that what is the case happening before the background of that
<br />
what is not the case.
<br />
That, what is not the case is the diversity-related conciseness in the
<br />
system of references, in that moment as that what is the case happens. That
<br />
what is the case does have consequences. If it increases, that what is not
<br />
the case decreases, if it shrinks, that what is not the case expands. The
<br />
question of what determines what is the case is answered by the function
<br />
concise(). The function concise() can accept arguments as well from the
<br />
similarity and as well from the diversity set of symbols. 
<br />
If the units of something get too much alike among itself, something on
<br />
differentness gets out of bounds. If the units of something get too much
<br />
diverse among each others, something of sameness gets out of bounds. A
<br />
common set of rules for bounds applies. 
<br />
The diversity comes from the fact that the numbers don't match exactly. One
<br />
gets differing results for counting the units of a set as individuals as
<br />
opposed to counting them as members of groups. The diversity descriptor can
<br />
itself be used as a background unit and it is by its philosophical and
<br />
logical merits as legitimate as the counting system heretofore in use, that
<br />
is based on similarities of the units. This counting system is based on
<br />
dissimilar units and has as natural units gradations of &lt;how&gt;. Each unit is
<br />
different, so it is pretty well suited to measure diversity with.
<br />
Having a diversity-based  counting system standing alongside and
<br />
intermingling with the similarity-based counting system in use heretofore
<br />
allows predictions, bets, about which of the systems will be more
<br />
centralised, uniform, homogenous, etc. in the next moment. 
<br />
One can also bet on the step happening along the &lt;where&gt; dimension of the
<br />
logical swarm not quite finding its place. 
<br />
The unit in the &lt;where&gt; dimension is a step in a consecutive enumeration.
<br />
The step is on N. We predict a place as we discuss the effects of
<br />
gravitation. 
<br />
So, let me thank for the invitation to present a technique possible by using
<br />
probability extents as units. The assertion was that gravitation is just
<br />
another name for a prediction about a place. The prediction is possible,
<br />
because there is something that is there to predict, something that can be
<br />
otherwise. The relation between otherwise and so-wise can be brought back to
<br />
properties of natural numbers as one uses them to maybe conduct additions
<br />
with them or maybe not. If one does not decide whether one does conduct an
<br />
addition or not, one has a basic set of lego-like playthings to use. Where
<br />
these come next to lie is in some approaches predictable. If the certitude
<br />
that the prediction will come true refers to the result of a linear
<br />
enumeration on N, one speaks of the extent of the (in this case:
<br />
gravitational) force. In reality, one measures the inner certitude that
<br />
one's predictions re the place of the thing will come true. In this fashion,
<br />
this is a rhetorical de-Newtonisation of mechanics. Newton would never have
<br />
put his findings in subjective terms of convictions of presaging the future
<br />
being attributed to some outside force. 
<br />
Using two counting systems in tandem, that one based on similarity, like the
<br />
one actually in use, and another one, this one based on the diversity of the
<br />
units, allows recognising patterns. Some relations between where and when
<br />
explain themselves by the artefacts of the counting systems. 
<br />
There indeed exists a concise logical picture of gravity, what the advocatus
<br />
diaboli negated. Please adjudicate in the sense of the notion.
