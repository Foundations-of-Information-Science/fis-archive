Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>Our discussion is quite hot and it seems that the definition of information
<br />
becomes clearer. However a significant part of the discussion is rotating
<br />
around the old question what comes first, mind or matter. Is there
<br />
information in non-living physical world or not, etc. etc. Karl is right, if
<br />
you want to find it there, you will do this. But what is external world
<br />
without observation, i.e. without imposing to it some information? Only a
<br />
small subset of possible worlds would bear regularity of observation
<br />
(defined by a small and maybe unique subset of fundamental constants), thus
<br />
you will find information outside. But what was the choice of realization of
<br />
this world? In any realization we come to the antinomy of goal and
<br />
mechanism. Inconsistencies exist in many trivial phrases like &quot;mechanism of
<br />
goal&quot; or something similar. Such &quot;mechanism of goal&quot; will appear
<br />
simultaneously as the goal will disappear and also information will
<br />
disappear as a realization of a choice, but deterministic physical law will
<br />
appear. Actually this trick was realized in classical physics. It can
<br />
continue infinitely and we will not come to understanding what is
<br />
information. Mind and matter are the different embeddings of the same
<br />
reality (we could try to define it as information but this will also not be
<br />
useful).
<br />
<p>If any mechanistic picture with classical physical laws contains information
<br />
not for us but by itself, this term is redundant. We are playing around old
<br />
paradoxes: we need some pre-existing information to define what is
<br />
information. By defining information we may come to the conclusion that it
<br />
is all (pan-informationalism or pan-semiotism), which is the same to the
<br />
statement that it is nothing. Information belongs to Vorstellung, which is
<br />
nothing without Wille. So (the structurized by Wille) Vorstellung contains
<br />
some information not by itself but for Wille, otherwise the term is
<br />
redundant. Deterministic physics could exist without this term, but
<br />
Aristotelian physics could not (I mean the correlates of this term like form
<br />
and entelechy). It is difficult to construct quantitative picture based on
<br />
qualitativism of the Aristotelian physics but quantum mechanics is developed
<br />
in this direction.
<br />
<p>As I wrote earlier (and I would be in the line with Karl as well as with
<br />
James but maybe in other words and expressions), information exists where
<br />
some reflective system can choose its final state, it needs some knowledge
<br />
about this state and this knowledge is information. Is this tautology? Yes
<br />
and no. Information includes some (virtual) movement from future to present,
<br />
and as I wrote earlier, the statement of Socrates &quot;knowledge is remembrance&quot;
<br />
is quite useful. It seems to be a tautology, but this is a creative
<br />
tautology. Wisdom is a most perfect &quot;remembrance&quot;. You cannot &quot;remember&quot;
<br />
future precisely, you may be only more or less correct. A message may be
<br />
read by different ways and to hold simultaneously a set of potential
<br />
readings in one superposition is important. However absolute relativism will
<br />
lead to the absence of information, so if our messages can be read by
<br />
absolutely different ways our discussion will not contain any information.
<br />
This may exist if we define similar terms differently and have no consensus
<br />
on that.
<br />
<p>As for reductionistic definitions of information following Shannon, they may
<br />
be useful in concrete applications but not for general definition of
<br />
information. We need to interact with external reality by some way in order
<br />
to get measure of order or disorder. Such interaction will be uncontrollable
<br />
to the extent described by Zeno aporias, Gödel theorem and Heisenberg's
<br />
uncertainty principle (actually these three are the same thing). Thus where
<br />
will be objective order or disorder measure? Robert Rosen stated that
<br />
complexity is not the property of a system, but the property of its
<br />
description (this includes its internal description). We can come to very
<br />
well ordered world, but this will be our world, not just external and it
<br />
cannot be completely described in terms of entropy.
<br />
<p>As for positive definition of information, it could perfectly be as in the
<br />
letter of Karl from May 20 (the first definition as well as the second:
<br />
&quot;Information points out one specific realization among several possible
<br />
realization&quot;). Actually we cannot say afterwards that several realizations
<br />
existed after a choice has been made, and any definition of information will
<br />
be paradoxical. Further Karl develops some quantitative principles defining
<br />
objective value of information. Information exists for reflective systems
<br />
realizing measurement. It has pragmatic value and it has objective value not
<br />
is the sense of externality but in the sense of perfection of canons
<br />
realized during measurement process. 
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
Andrei Igamberdiev
