<p>
Gordana &amp; Igor, et al:
<br />
<p>Your postings caught my attention and I forwarded
<br />
them to Judith Rosen, Robert Rosen's daughter, who
<br />
was close with him in his scientific writings.
<br />
<p>She asked me to forward the following:
<br />
<p>&quot;Robert Rosen never said that we can't make a machine
<br />
that repairs itself or that reproduces itself. He simply
<br />
said that those machines are not and cannot be alive. The
<br />
entailment structure underlying the behavior of any
<br />
self-repairing/replicating machine is entirely different
<br />
from that of living organisms. The difference between such
<br />
simulations of life and actual living systems has to do with
<br />
what entails the repair capability-- and with the simultaneous
<br />
presence of the capability of metabolism-- and with what 
<br />
entails IT as well. 
<br />
<p>Bear in mind that RR defines &quot;machine&quot; in a very particular
<br />
way. So by that definition, we will never create a living
<br />
&quot;machine&quot;-- however, that does not mean that he felt it was
<br />
impossible to create living systems. He told me himself that
<br />
he was pretty sure he could do it. In that event, what has 
<br />
been created is not &quot;a machine&quot;-- regardless of what it is
<br />
made out of. It's an organism. 
<br />
<p>The organization of a machine, by definition, is not complex;
<br />
it's what he referred to as &quot;simple&quot; (regardless of how
<br />
complicated it might be-- this is the difference between his
<br />
definition of complexity and complicatedness). In contrast,
<br />
the organization of any living organism is extremely complex.
<br />
Complexity, as a &quot;measure&quot; of organizational type, is not about
<br />
size or about structural intricacy, it's about the nature of
<br />
the organization itself and what that multiplicity of relational
<br />
interaction, cohesion, and dimension can generate in terms of 
<br />
material and temporal effects, etc. It's not important what the
<br />
material aspects are, where living systems are concerned. It's
<br />
about all the interactive relational stuff giving rise to effects
<br />
and behaviors that none of those material parts would/could ever
<br />
be capable of on their own. That's why it is often said that a 
<br />
complex system is &quot;more than the sum of its parts&quot;. 
<br />
<p>How else can it be explained that we can fully measure the 
<br />
material ingredients of any living organism we choose, and
<br />
yet no matter how we try to combine those ingredients, the
<br />
result is not a living organism? 
<br />
<p>Please invite whomever has asked this question to contact me
<br />
if there are further questions, all right? I'd be surprised
<br />
if there aren't, and I'd very much like to talk over why 
<br />
these things are so. 
<br />
<p>Slainte, 
<br />
Judith&quot;
<br />
<p><p>If anyone is interested, contact me off-list 
<br />
and I'll make the arrangements.
<br />
<p>Jamie Rose
