<p>
Søren, you said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Stan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for all these good thought and comments. I confess that i have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tried to read some of you books but did not get very far. I know I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not the only one who found your books hard to read.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Alas, I know it too well! The problem is, I think, that I tried to
<br />
do many things simultaneously, using jargon from many fields in any
<br />
sentence.  I felt it was necessary, but then... well...  Perhaps too soon
<br />
(- and later will be too late!.)
<br />
<p>So please take this
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opportunity to communicate the central points to us and relate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructively to what I have suggested so we can move forward.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Thank you. I will try:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would like to see the mentioned paper.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Do you mean:  Salthe, 2002, General Systtems Bulletin 31:13-17.?
<br />
I attach a pdf of this paper.  I have pasted in below a short text on
<br />
finality in science discourse.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;About your  remarks on the mechanistic foundation of cybernetics, then I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use second order cybernetics. But I agree that it does not really escape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the problem because it does not make a full philosophy. That is why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use Peirce's philosophy as the frame for second order cybernetics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;including Luhmann's theories of communication and society.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This in itself I think is a good move.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The question to which degree we can talk of sign making in non living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems is a delicate one. It depends on what you think can constitute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an interpretant.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Yes, I have tried a bit in Semiotica 120: 389-394 (The Hoffmeyer
<br />
book special issue) and in other places in passing.  It is a matter of
<br />
getting a definite enough picture of the abiotic dissipative structures.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway it is on a another level than the biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sign games. I would prefer to talk about proto-sign or informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;signals  within formal causation and those relation to the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information science work to be placed at this level, but again in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Peircian framework relativizing the way many information processing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people think of the scope and possibilities of the informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I think Peirce himself found no barrier to laying his triadism
<br />
upon any aspect of nature.  He was not restricted to the living.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Using Peirce - and being a biologist - I of course agree in synergistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolutionary thinking going all the way to the self-conscious linguistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level of humans.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d'accord!
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For FIS discussion  with start 22.Jan. 2004  by Søren Brier, Management,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Politics and Philosophy, Copenhagen Business School, sbr.lpf&#64;cbs.dk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have beeen told that interleaving remarks is not favored in Fis. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it  impossible for me to technically comment on parts of this text without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doing so.  Only in this way can I make specific points.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; STAN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    So, first some general comments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    I would point out that, while Nature is not a machine, cybernetics is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mechanistic mode of thinking (although second order cybernetics tries to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; get away from this), while Peircean semiotic is less so when using its more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; general categories.  As these categories become elaborated, however, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; become more precise, and, therefore, more mechanistic as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      The word 'heterarchy', in earlier meanings was meant to convey a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; messiness of Nature when it was attempted to fit the scale hierarchy model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; over it.  My point is that hierarchy is a model, which fits, to some degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or other, many aspects of Nature, but not necessarilly all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Søren said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;1.Levels emerge through emergent processes when new holons appear through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;higher level organization. These principles can be placed into a Peircean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;perspective, where potentialities (Firstness) are processes manifested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;through constraints and forces (Secondness), into regularities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;patterns (Thirdness). This process is continuing in a recursive manner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;from level to level. The new emergent level then acts as a potential for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;the development of the next level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: The way this is stated, it implies that levels emerge in a pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of one on top of the next. This is materially impossible.  I have argued
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Salthe, 1986, Evolving Hierarchical Systems) that new levels always emerge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between pre-existing ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;2. Levels can form and dissolve when their dynamical parameters are near
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;critical points, like when nucleons form and dissolve in a quark soup.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Stabilization requires that the system moves further from the critical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;point into organizing patterns, like energy wells.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: It is my view that stability is anchored to larger scale
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constraints from higher levels.  These foster the emergence, and preserve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it as long as they remain in effect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;6. ... Machines lack autopoiesis, reproduction, code-duality, and an inner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;organization of membranes, and thus also lack both individually- and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;species-based motivation and intentionality and therefore consequently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;also the ability to establish a genuine interpretant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: Well, if these properties (autopoiesis, code-duality, etc.) can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fully and explicitly stated or modeled, then they would be mechanistic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Membrane organization may not be fully describable, nor motivation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intentionality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;8. Meaning is most manifest in the living systems that fulfill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hoffmeyers conditions. But starting from dissipative systems, one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; define a heterarchy of pre-living self-organized systems as based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; degrees of closure, asymmetry between inside and outside, protocomunication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; over membranes, digital representation and formation of interfaces.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: It is important to note that living systems derive from abiotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ones, and so whatever properties they have must have had precursors in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ancestral abiotic systems.  We will never understand the origin of life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without this consideration.  Note that, as evolution proceeded into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sociocultural level, the ability to be more fully explicit increased:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; {abiotic -&gt; {biotic -&gt; {cultural }}}. This can be viewed as a development
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of increased definiteness (over, it must be said, a smaller and smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; portion of Nature).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;a) A primary chaotic level of continuity, quality, and potentiality, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;the tendency to form habits (Firstness). This would include the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;vacuum field as it is conceptualized by modern physics as one aspect only.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b) A causal level of matter, energy, and causality by natural forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Secondness and its brute force). The level of efficient causation much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; connected with physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; c) An informational cybernetic system level of quasi-semiotic signals that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; encompass the goal-oriented mechanical systems described by first-order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; classical cybernetics. Described from a cybersemiotic view, concepts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information as signals of differences make sense only when interpreted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quasi-signs. This is the level of formal causation much connected with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chemistry and the level of reflexes in the body. d) The semiotic level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; belonging to all living systems (biosemiotics) and is much connected with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; biology. The living systems are the basis of true triadic semiosis --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; producing signification spheres in sign games. This level encompasses the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; work of Uexküll (1934) and ethologists such as Lorenz (1970-1971, 1973) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tinbergen (1973) within a broad semiotic framework. This is the level where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unconscious final causation dominates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; e) The level of conscious languaging systems (language games, arguments) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so far occupied only by the social realm of humans and their culture. Here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; final causation is full-blown in self-consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: These levels look to me like integrative levels in a specification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hierarchy: {physical world {material/chemical world {biological world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; {sociopolitical world}}}}, not the scalar levels talked about above.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think it is important to keep track of what we are making here.  These two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hierarchies can both be applied to any system, but it helps clear thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to distinguish them -- especally since they have different properties (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Salthe, 2002, General Systtems Bulletin 31:13-17.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Sign-making is thus immanent in nature, but manifest only in full triadic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;semiosis within autopoietic living systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: I contest this.  It is manifest in abiotic dissipative structures,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but in much vaguer, even episodic, form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Brier.pdf&gt;pdf Questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1.Cant we avoid the metaphysics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: There is a metaphysic involved in so-called avoiding M.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;2.Is a theory of levels really necessary?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: It depends upon what we wish  a theory to show, and how we wish to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; show it.  You could have a network model instead if you like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;3. Arent we supposed to keep mind and meaning out of scientific theories?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: That is science as it has been -- the handmaiden of technology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with entirely pragmatic aims.   Complexity science already has escaped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; instrumental purposes!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;6. Is final causation a scientific concept?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: I have made it out to be (I have a short MS on this for any who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would like to see it), but not for science as it HAS been.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;7. Is it possible to define science on another basis than the mechanistic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: Again, I think so, but this brings in finality, internalism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; vagueness, semiotics, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;8. If we have given up the belief in a universal mechanistic science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;shouldnt we then avoid grand schemes like the intended her as they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;unscientific in their base.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: In my view what is to be avoided is full explicitness in modeling.

November, 2002 - March, 2003
<br />
&nbsp;A Gallery of Final causes:
<br />
<p>(1) Classical Aristotelian final cause. The attraction of developments by
<br />
their Telos. I see various versions ranging from (a) the mechanistic
<br />
biological notion of genetic information (playing the role of a fixed
<br />
Telos) entraining ontogeny, to (b) a more open idea that any
<br />
self-organizing system gradually constructs (discovers) the self (Telos)
<br />
that will be awaiting its development when that process is winding down
<br />
after maturity. Logically this process of individuation can be demonstrated
<br />
to be finalistic in the sense that, when a unique self finally appears
<br />
fully blown, we can see that it implies (material implication, conceptual
<br />
subordination) the last stage that led to it, and that that stage implies
<br />
the prior stage, and so on.
<br />
<p>2) Anticipation by the &quot;hyperincursion&quot; model of Daniel Dubois, via the
<br />
&quot;generative entrenchment&quot; concept of William Wimsatt, and other similar
<br />
ideas. A system acts in such a way as to narrow its possible actions in the
<br />
future. Results of past actions embed themselves in the system memory, and
<br />
the results of later actions push these earlier records into a position to
<br />
constrain subsequent actions at an even earlier stage in their generation.
<br />
The system's activities become increasingly less adventuresome as it
<br />
develops, with results more easily predicted in advance. The system goes
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from having a memory to anticipating the future. Finality is already
</em><br />
implicit in memory, and gets established as inertia, routines, maps, etc.
<br />
-- as, in short, anticipation.
<br />
<p>(3) The Aristotelian idea that final cause is that which a process
<br />
(development, construction, evolution) furthers (as part of the four causes
<br />
perspective). The generalization: {variational principle { function {
<br />
purpose }}} shows the full range of this idea, from human purpose to the
<br />
likes of the Second Law of thermodynamics.  In scientific discourse, any
<br />
maximizing or minimizing tendency comes under this type.  For example, in
<br />
neoDarwinian evolutionary theory, the fitness of a population is maximized
<br />
above various tradeoffs among changes in morphological traits and
<br />
behaviors.  The theory imposes fitness maximization as a final cause
<br />
(without calling it that).
<br />
<p>(4) A special application of the last type -- the social construction of
<br />
knowledge. An example makes it clear. There is an agricultural pest.
<br />
Chemical companies will try to manufacture a pesticide; biotechnology
<br />
companies will try to construct a better predator; environmentalists will
<br />
design a new agrisystem to minimize damage by the pest. Each group has
<br />
constructed a different world (its Umwelt, of Uexküll), with a different
<br />
pest, and their preconceptions determine in advance what kind of solution
<br />
they will come up with. To some extent this must be true of all material
<br />
systems, which will be biased in one way or another due to their material
<br />
embodiment, which excludes some possibilities even as it enables others.
<br />
<p>(5) The attraction of dynamics by structural attractors. This works both in
<br />
the world of simulations and, presumably, in the material world. The
<br />
attractors are part of the large scale, global structure of the system
<br />
within which the dynamics take place, and so are external to the dynamics
<br />
that may access them. Once in place they do not change except very slowly
<br />
with respect to the dynamics they constrain, but different degrees of
<br />
simultaneous attraction toward several structures at given locales can
<br />
result in fairly unique entrainments -- still showing the tell-tale
<br />
similarities not directly inherited from ancestral systems.
<br />
<p>(6) The response of the dynamics of a small scale system to boundary
<br />
conditions imposed by the results of large scale dynamics in the same
<br />
supersystem. These boundary conditions impose their constraint prior to
<br />
some action by the small scale system, but, because the large scale system
<br />
would not change significantly during the activity of a small scale one
<br />
(its cogent moment being much larger), these same boundary conditions will
<br />
still be in effect when the small scale activity has ended. That is to say,
<br />
these boundary conditions will not only inform the initiation of an action,
<br />
but will 'call for it' (B. C. Patten) simultaneously from the future (of
<br />
the small scale system).  In this category we find the entrainment of
<br />
faster changing dynamics by slower ones.
<br />
<p>(7) From Koichiro Matsuno, the necessity for local activities to occur in
<br />
such a way as to further equilibration, as well as to seek internal
<br />
consistency among responses to multiple impinging rival pressures and
<br />
affordances, as well as the necessity for activities in different locales
<br />
to further global equilibration and overall dynamical consistency, as
<br />
viewed from outside the system.  The latter is necessitated in material
<br />
systems by lack of instantaneous communication from one locale to another,
<br />
so that each locale is always lagged with respect to all others.  Local
<br />
perturbations, tradeoffs, and contingencies are continually disrupting
<br />
progress of any kind, so that all activities are continually working to
<br />
regain lost consistency and to continue deferred equilibration.  An example
<br />
of this in neoDarwinian evolutionary theory is Van Valen's Red Queen
<br />
hypothesis, where any evolutionary improvement in one population in a biome
<br />
will force all others to adjust, in an endless evolutionary jockeying among
<br />
populations to keep energy shares flowing through them as before.
<br />
<p><p>(Edwina's reaction: [This isn't] too clear to me - i.e. -- the value of the
<br />
differences between them. I consider final cause to be located in the
<br />
community, the network, i.e., outside the singular unit, and it is
<br />
'pulling' the unit within its constraints.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Looks OK for 1,a; could work in 2; definitely in 3, OK in some
<br />
sense for 7, but not in the others.  So, my view is more general than hers.
