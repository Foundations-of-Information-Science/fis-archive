                <p>
                    I'm new to this list, so I will give a brief description of my
                    <br />
                    background, then a brief account of my understanding of information,
                    <br />
                    in the hope of eliciting some comments.
                    <br />
                <p>I have a BA (Hons) in philosophy and psychology and obtained an MSc in
                    <br />
                    information technology in 1986. I worked in academic research first in
                    <br />
                    computing then computer modelling in environmental economics. I left
                    <br />
                    academia in 1998 to start my own computer maintenance business, but
                    <br />
                    health problems over the last 2-3 years have obstructed that, and I
                    <br />
                    have instead been pursuing my long-standing interest in philosophy of
                    <br />
                    mind. Although I've only recently had much time to devote to such
                    <br />
                    studies, my ideas have been developing over the last 25-30 years, and
                    <br />
                    even 3 years ago, I had several tens of thousands of words, though
                    <br />
                    none of it had ever been published (or even submitted).
                    <br />
                <p>I have only quite recently become aware of the new field of philosophy
                    <br />
                    of information, but I've given a great deal of thought to the place of
                    <br />
                    information in phil of mind, and have come to some quite firm
                    <br />
                    conclusions, on which I'd like to get some feedback. I have already
                    <br />
                    submitted a conference paper abstract but it hasn't yet been accepted
                    <br />
                    so I guess I could retract it if you people manage to convince me
                    <br />
                    there's a serious error of some sort. What follows is almost identical
                    <br />
                    to the abstract.
                    <br />
                <p>In this paper I combine and extend some ideas of Daniel Dennett with
                    <br />
                    one from Wittgenstein and another from physics. Dennett introduced the
                    <br />
                    concepts of the physical, design and intentional stances (1987), and
                    <br />
                    has suggested (with John Haugeland) that �&#x20ac;&#x153;some concept of INFORMATION
                    <br />
                    could serve eventually to unify mind, matter, and meaning in a single
                    <br />
                    theory.�&#x20ac;&#x9d; (Dennett and Haugeland, 1987, emphasis in the original)
                    <br />
                <p>The concept of physical information is now very well established. The famous
                    <br />
                    bet between physicists Stephen Hawking and John Preskill that Hawking conceded
                    <br />
                    he�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d lost in July 2004 concerned whether physical information is conserved in
                    <br />
                    black holes. (Preskill, 2004) Physical information is basically material form.
                    <br />
                    The concept derives from C.E. Shannon�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s information theory (1948) and has no
                    <br />
                    semantic component. When this concept is taken to its logical conclusion, an
                    <br />
                    energy flow becomes an information flow and an object becomes its own
                    <br />
                    description. The crucial distinction is between form and
                    <br />
                    substance. Dennett�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s
                    <br />
                    physical stance could be renamed the �&#x20ac;&#x153;substantial stance,�&#x20ac;&#x9d; while I
                    <br />
                    introduce an
                    <br />
                    additional stance to account for information, called the �&#x20ac;&#x153;formal
                    <br />
                    stance,�&#x20ac;&#x9d; in
                    <br />
                    which we attend to form rather than substance.
                    <br />
                <p>The common concept of information is intentional. Intentional information is
                    <br />
                    encoded in physical information, being decoded (and re-encoded) in use. This
                    <br />
                    is consistent with the Wittgensteinian concept of meaning as use in context (or
                    <br />
                    in a �&#x20ac;&#x153;language game�&#x20ac;&#x9d; (1972)), where the context is the key. Thus the
                    <br />
                    colour of
                    <br />
                    an apple is encoded in the characteristics of the light entering the eye of an
                    <br />
                    observer, where a tree or a fruit bowl and the pre-existing concept of
                    <br />
                    �&#x20ac;&#x153;apple�&#x20ac;&#x9d;
                    <br />
                    or �&#x20ac;&#x153;fruit�&#x20ac;&#x9d; contribute to the context, and further analysis might
                    indicate
                    <br />
                    probable degree of ripeness. Human communications involve additional levels of
                    <br />
                    en/decoding and complexity but the same principle of intentional information
                    <br />
                    encoded in physical information obtains. Brains encode intentional information
                    <br />
                    too, provided that we adopt the formal stance and the intentional stance
                    <br />
                    towards them. (The intentional stance actually implies the formal stance, as
                    <br />
                    only information can be intentional.)
                    <br />
                <p>To adopt Dennett�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s intentional stance toward an object is to suppose that the
                    <br />
                    object encodes intentional information. To adopt his design stance is to view
                    <br />
                    something as the product of an intentional information process.
                    <br />
                <p>Though the physical stance is very natural and practical in many contexts, the
                    <br />
                    formal stance is superior in a certain sense: information is all that our
                    <br />
                    senses
                    <br />
                    convey, we do not experience matter directly, it can be considered a
                    <br />
                    theoretical
                    <br />
                    entity (or set of entities).
                    <br />
                <p>A mind is a user or processor of intentional information. Matter is a
                    <br />
                    theoretical entity extrapolated from physical information. Meaning is
                    <br />
                    intentional information (though multiple levels of en/decoding might
                    <br />
                    be involved), and consciousness is the use or processing of
                    <br />
                    intentional information. Thus Dennett�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s prediction is fulfilled.
