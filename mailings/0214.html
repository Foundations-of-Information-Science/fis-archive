Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>Stephen Springette's statement about the need for a &quot;new approach&quot; to
<br />
information science (a few days back) has lured me out of my lurking
<br />
mode and encouraged me to wade into the discussion.  I would like to
<br />
indicate the direction which I believe this &quot;new approach&quot; should take
<br />
in order (among other things) to remedy what Jesper Hoffmeyer, Stanley
<br />
Salthe and others have pointed out as the shortcomings of McShea's
<br />
approach to biological complexity -- namely, that it ignores the
<br />
informational or semiotic dimension of organisms.  I think that my
<br />
approach may also connect up with Stephen's ideas on &quot;universal
<br />
associationism,&quot; but I had better let him be the judge of that.
<br />
<p>Call the mainstream position the &quot;cybernetic-selectionist&quot; (CS) view. 
<br />
The problem with the CS view is that both cybernetics and selectionism
<br />
beg the question of teleology.  Cybernetics begs the question because it
<br />
uses &quot;information&quot; as a primitive concept, but &quot;information&quot; (in its
<br />
semantic aspect, at least) is itself a teleological notion.  Natual
<br />
selection begs the question as well, since &quot;selection&quot; through
<br />
biological functions, and the comparative advantage of some functions
<br />
relative to others.  Thus, neither cybernetics nor natural selection
<br />
EXPLAINS the source of functional organization in organisms, which is
<br />
the key to everything we are discussing here.
<br />
<p>So what other approach is thee to understanding teleology in a
<br />
naturalistic way?  There would seem to be two possibilities: nonlinear
<br />
dynamics and quantum mechanics.  The relative merits of each have mostly
<br />
been discussed in relation to the brain (see Alwyn Scott and Stuart
<br />
Hameroff's debate entitled &quot;A Sonoran Afternoon&quot; in Tucson II), but I
<br />
believe we must start with the cell and work our way up.  For my money,
<br />
the nonlinear dynamics approach of Gene Yates (&quot;homeodynamics&quot;) is the
<br />
most promising way of understanding the massive coherence and
<br />
coordination of functional organization (although I admit that
<br />
homeodynamics must still connect up with condensed-matter physics at
<br />
some  point, perhaps along the lines of Frohlich, del Giudice, et al.
<br />
(&quot;quantum bioelectrodynamics&quot;)).
<br />
<p>How does homoedynamics relate to information and cognition?  I have
<br />
proposed a tetradic model of fundamental cognition in contrast to the
<br />
triadic semiotic model. I won't go into the details here, but in a
<br />
nutshell, you model final causation using nonlinear attractors, define
<br />
the SUCCESS of goal-directed action as the maintenance of the DYNAMICAL
<br />
STABILITY of the attractor, and posit a subsystem (which I call the
<br />
&quot;epistemon&quot;) capable of undergoing LOW-ENERGY interactions with the
<br />
surround in such a way that: (a) the low-energy inputs correlate with
<br />
the normal environmental conditions supporting successful functional
<br />
action, and (b) the inputs act as a trigger for the function action.  In
<br />
this way, the low-energy inputs in effect PREDICT the success of the
<br />
functional action.  This, I submit, is the essence of INFORMATION... the
<br />
prediction of successful functional action.
<br />
<p>What is the point of all this?  In addition to confronting the problem
<br />
of teleology head-on, this approach gives us a way of understanding the
<br />
epistemic foundation uniting all living things.  Thus, it can form the
<br />
basis of a comprehensive &quot;dynamical-emergentist&quot; (DE) worldview as a
<br />
successor to the CS worldview.
<br />
<p>What about complexity?  On this view, what is important is the
<br />
informational aspect of organisms, as outlined above.  If you call each
<br />
kind of low-energy interaction an &quot;epistemic interaction&quot;, then the
<br />
total number of the different kind of epistemic interactions an organism
<br />
is capable of would give a rough measure of its complexity (what I call
<br />
its &quot;epistemid depth&quot;).  The beauty of this approach is that it gives us
<br />
a way to measure organism with brains and those without them on the same
<br />
scale (if you assume something like Walter J. Freeman's model of brain
<br />
activity in which concepts are correlated with attractors in EEG date).
<br />
<p>Another advantage of this approach is that it is easier to cocneptualize
<br />
the parallel between phylogenetic adaptation and ontogenetic learning in
<br />
terms of bifurcations within a landscape of attractors.  Biological
<br />
complexification seems to proceed by a process of recombination and
<br />
accretion of functions, whether of enzymes at the cellular level, or of
<br />
ideas at the level of human civilization.
<br />
<p>Best wishes to all,
<br />
<p>James
