Dear all,
<br />
<p>It is really have some difficulty to understand how we can think that
<br />
&quot;logic&quot; is a (narrow) human invention!!!????
<br />
<p>We DISCOVER the world and the universe around us but we don't INVENT it. We
<br />
discover slowly by slowly how the world &quot;works&quot;. We transform a given
<br />
reality and by interacting with it (mostly still in extremely &quot;unconscient&quot;
<br />
way) we produce changes and we (RE) invent things. And so on.. This is the
<br />
process of evolution.
<br />
<p>To think that LOGIC has something to do with my individual understanding (or
<br />
agreement) seems to be a kind of very radical anthropocentrism. Or however
<br />
we call it.
<br />
<p>If the world is what it is, and if I don't agree with a lot of things (in
<br />
fact I don't agree with war, racism, crazy dubble yuu´s, etc...) it does not
<br />
mean that there is NO LOGIC in the whole process!
<br />
<p>If I perceive something as a chaos, it doesn't mean that there is no
<br />
intrinsic logic in it.
<br />
<p>Logic also doesn't mean determinism! This would be in fact a very narrow
<br />
understanding of logic.
<br />
<p>I am not sure, but I think Ted said: &quot;I wonder what the FIS agenda is
<br />
thought to be by anyone who assumes logic is somehow embedded in the
<br />
mechanics of the universe.&quot;
<br />
<p>I don't think that I understand correctly: first of all the universe is not
<br />
at all &quot;mechanic&quot;.. the view of a mechanistic universe has been overcome at
<br />
least 100 years ago. Of course I think that there is an intrinsic logic in
<br />
the evolution of the universe, our solar system, our planet, and the whole
<br />
evolution (including ourselves) on it.
<br />
<p>Or, maybe we should define clearly what every one of us understands by
<br />
LOGIC.
<br />
<p>For me, a system has its intrinsic logic - if its regulations, laws and
<br />
interactions lead to pragmatic consequences, which are NOT deterministic
<br />
(!), but are &quot;free&quot; to happen in a frame of limited possibilities (given
<br />
exactly by the logic of the system).
<br />
<p>And I think that this discussion makes sense when we try to understand and
<br />
define the concept of INFORMATION.
<br />
<p>There is an obvious relation between logic (how I am used to understand the
<br />
concept) and structural Information of an open dissipative system.
<br />
<p>regards
<br />
Norbert
