Well said. I have often given the same response when people challenge me
in talks to give a definition of information.<br><br>
At 03:25 PM 2005/09/14, Hans C. von Baeyer wrote:<br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">Thank you, Marcin, for your
caution against trying to find THE definition of<br>
information!&nbsp; I tend to think in analogies, and since I'm a
physicist, they<br>
often come from physics.&nbsp; In this case I have already introduced the
analogy<br>
to energy, and I'd like to take it a step further.<br><br>
Everyone knows what energy is, but nobody knows what energy REALLY
IS.<br>
There is no simple definition in any textbook!&nbsp; Instead, there are
two<br>
things:<br><br>
1) There are dozens of specific and well-understood formulas for energy
in<br>
different circumstances (eg kinetic energy, potential gravitational
energy,<br>
rest mass energy, chemical energy etc)&nbsp; Similarly, there could be
many<br>
specific measures or even definitions of information in different<br>
circumstances.<br><br>
2) There is a law of conservation of energy, which every one of the
formulas<br>
mentioned above fits into.&nbsp; In the case of information, there seems
to be a<br>
hint of some kind of second law (eg Kahre's law of diminishing
information,<br>
the second law of thermodynamics... )&nbsp; but nothing that I know of
that's<br>
crisp and universal.&nbsp; So besides looking for definitions of
information, we<br>
ought to be looking also for laws that this information obeys, and that
can<br>
be usefully employed to make predictions or at least to clrify
processes.</blockquote><br>
What we need more than a common law is a common currency. Any sort<br>
of energy can be converted into any other (sometimes with a large
cost).<br><br>
Here is a nested categorization from my paper in Entropy<br>
<a href="../../www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e5020100.pdf" eudora="autourl">
http://www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e5020100.pdf<br>
</a>The most liberal and inclusive view is the “It From Bit” view. It has
originated independently from so many people that it is pointless to
attribute an origin, though it probably goes back to Leibniz’s view that
the world has a logical structure in terms of sensations based in the
ability to discriminate. The term is due to John Wheeler, and the view
has recently been powerfully if controversially championed by Stephen
Wolfram. On this view, any causally grounded distinction makes a
difference. It might be called a God’s eye perspective, or the view from
nowhere. On this view information is objective, and there is nothing
else. <br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica">The negentropy view of information is a
restriction on the It From Bit view. Only those Its that are capable of
doing work (organizing and using energy, or for sorting things) count as
information. The rest is disorder. This view is due to Schrödinger [41],
though the groundwork was done by Szillard. The motivation for this view
is that work is required for control, and the information in microstates
beyond that in macrostates is hidden from view. Negentropy measures the
capacity for control (in bits, the number of discriminations that a
system can make). <br>
</font>The next view is a restriction of the negentropic approach to
particular levels of a physical hierarchy, so that information is
relativized to a cohesive level of an object, such as an organism or a
species. The view is due to Brooks and Wiley [4, 46], Collier [11] and
Smith [43]. The idea is that not all negentropy is expressed at a given
level, and the “Its” available are level relative. This information is a
measure of the constraints on the objects within the level; because of
their connection to biological and cognitive form, Collier [13] calls
this expressed information <font face="Arial, Helvetica">enformation
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica">to distinguish it from other forms
of negentropy (for example, disordered information due to nonequilibrium
conditions is sometimes called
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica">intropy</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica">). Lyla Gatlin [28] called this information
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica">stored
information</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica">, but this name is
somewhat misleading, as it does not reflect its dynamical and often
active nature. This sort of information will be the focus of this paper.
<br>
</font>Restricting further we have functional information, which is the
expressed information that is functional. I will address this sort of
information in this paper, but I will have little to say about it. Some
functional information is meaningful. The nature of meaning is the great
object of desire for information theory. Within the scope of meaningful,
or semantic information, is intentional information, or cognitive
content. At the next level of restriction is social information, though
some authors hold that cognitive content depends on language, which is a
social activity. I will not discuss these levels further here, which is
not to say that they are unimportant, or are in some sense reducible to
the information forms that I do discuss. <br><br>
In general, each nest is harder to produce from the previous, but is
produced from it and other resources. I talk only of information in its
bound form in which the complexions are of physical states. Of course
there are lots of discussions of information that ignore this sort of
discipline (and for which it is in many case premature). However I think
it should be a goal, or unification is not going to be possible except
perhaps by mathematical formalism, which is no unification at
all.<br><br>
So rather than a single definition of information, I suggest we work more
towards a unification of the theory of information, otherwise there will
be no science of information as such.<br><br>
This discussion has taken an interesting turn.<br><br>
