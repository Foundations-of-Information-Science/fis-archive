<p>
dear christophe, thank you for the comments.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Wolfgang,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here are some points your article brings up that I would like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to comment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Presentation of &quot;information&quot; as a super concept that deserves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being subdivised into relevant particular concepts is an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way to addres the subject, as it is true that &quot;information&quot; per se
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addresses an immense field of events.
</em><br />
<p>well, to some degree it may be a kind of a terminological problem 
<br />
which one of the related and cognate concepts is fixed in order to 
<br />
play the role of the generic one. but what i want to capture by that 
<br />
is that there ought to be a relationship between the concepts like 
<br />
the relationship between something more general, universal, and 
<br />
something more specific, particular. e.g., i think it makes sense to 
<br />
characterise knowledge as information with certain concrete traits.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your next point is to propose three fields: Cognition (content of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness), communication (common understanding),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cooperation (sense embodied in social structures).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A comment would be about the entry point you choose (in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of complexity) to introduce the concept of information: the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of human (cognition).
</em><br />
<p>yes, at the first glance, it is the level of human systems/ social 
<br />
systems where to find three fields of information processes. at a 
<br />
second glance, however, three fields like the ones mentioned seem to 
<br />
be characteristic of any systems. that is, in the systems 
<br />
perspective, you can focus on the intrasystemic field (the interior 
<br />
of a system) or on the intersystemic field (the field inbetween of 
<br />
systems) or on the suprasystemic field (the supersystem which is made 
<br />
up by the systems in question). (this categorisation, by the way, is 
<br />
due to the metasystem transition evolutionary systems undergo - an 
<br />
initial phase of, so to say, solitary systems, an intermediate phase 
<br />
of interacting systems and a phase of integration of the systems with 
<br />
a higher order system.) investigating into information processes in 
<br />
the first field is dealing with cognition, given human systems, and 
<br />
it is dealing with similar processes (soemthing like precognition) on 
<br />
the prehuman level. in the second field it is communicative processes 
<br />
on the human and something like precommunication on the prehuman 
<br />
level. and information processing for co-operation on the human level 
<br />
in the third field, while something like pre-co-operative processes 
<br />
on the prehuman level.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I feel one can take information as beginning to exist at the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of basic life (lower organization level than human), or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the level of matter (see Edwina's approach relative to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;informed matter&quot;). But later, in your &quot;unifying perspective&quot;,  you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reword this entry point as &quot;self organizing systems cognizing their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;umwelt&quot;. This wording can be looked at as containing basic life (but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not matter). Could you provide more precision about your entry point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for information concept introduction ?
</em><br />
<p>ok. i side with edwina in this point. i do not identify the beginning 
<br />
of information processes with the beginning of life but with the 
<br />
beginning of self-organisation instead. the big divide between 
<br />
systems that show information processes and those that don't is 
<br />
whether they are capable of organising themselves or not. systems 
<br />
that do not self-organise do not manifest information generacy. only 
<br />
self-organising systems are able to generate information. the most 
<br />
simple unit that shows information generation is the most 
<br />
rudimentary, the primordial self-organising system. this is clearly 
<br />
in the physical realm, long before and below living systems. it is my 
<br />
conviction that there you will be able to identify rudiments of 
<br />
cognizability, of communicability and of co-operability as to the 
<br />
three fields mentioned above. maybe my wording in the table is not 
<br />
exact and should read &quot;cognising resp. precognising&quot;.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, you write that &quot;properties of information in non human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;domains are usually extrapolated from properties of information in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human domain&quot;. I agree with this statement as being a fact, but do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really understand the rational behind it.
</em><br />
<p>that's a misunderstanding. i do not advocate anthropomorphic 
<br />
extrapolations. i warn against doing so.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, I feel that information really exists, and is to be considered, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;levels of organization lower that human. And extrapolating to non human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cases the properties of information as understod for human is a bit risky.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This because the level of human posseses specific performances (reflected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness, highly developped domain of emotions) that are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;currently extrapolatable to non human cases.
</em><br />
<p>sure, i absolutely agree. i try to favour a perspective that goes 
<br />
beyond capurro's trilemma as well as beyond snow's two cultures. that 
<br />
is, i argue against extrapolationism as well as reductionism.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And anthropocentrism may be misleading (one could prefer an evolutionist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach starting from a well understood position at basic life level, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then climbing up the ladder of complexity. Understanding that the nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of human is still to be explained in scientific terms).
</em><br />
<p>yes, in my opinion evolutionary systems thinking understood 
<br />
dialectically promises to be the remedy. it tries hard neither to 
<br />
extrapolate qualities appearing in a later stage of evolution onto 
<br />
earlier stages nor to reduce qualities appearing in a later stage to 
<br />
qualities appearing in an earlier stage. it looks upon evolution as a 
<br />
&quot;discontinuous continuum&quot;. that is, system qualities at different 
<br />
stages of evolution are linked by the relationship of emergence: they 
<br />
have something in common, but they differ by concrete forms - a 
<br />
succession of forms is resulting with each form containing the 
<br />
previous form by negating the previous form. emergent evolution adds 
<br />
new qualities to the old ones and redefines hereby what is in common 
<br />
(what is general, universal) and what is not (what is specific, 
<br />
particular). so the relationship of the universal and the particular 
<br />
is a historical one (and not only a logical one).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you distinguish two views on information: subjectivist and objectivist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This seems quite close to the two approaches of knowledge: constructivism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(knowledge as specific build up of reality by the knowing element) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representationalism (knowledge as a true image of the outside world).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would you agree on this comparison ?
</em><br />
<p>yes, that's the difference between the two views regarding human cognition.
<br />
<p>like the options of capurro's trilemma and the options of snow's 
<br />
cultures objectivism and subjectivism are one-sided, and therefore 
<br />
not completely wrong. my intention is to reconcile the views by 
<br />
analysing what can be accepted.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If by any chance you have developped elsewhere some of the points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addressed in your short article, please let us know.
</em><br />
<p>unfortunately, since the end of october i have been trying to replace 
<br />
my extended abstract on the website by a full version draft - the 
<br />
mdpi webmasters could not help so far. i will attach my file to a 
<br />
personal email to you.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christophe
</em><br />
<p>best,
