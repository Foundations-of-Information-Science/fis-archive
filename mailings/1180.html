<p>
I apologize, I have sent you a not definitive draft of my considerations
<br />
for the debate. Here follows the right version.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
Enzo Tiezzi
<br />
<p><p><p>FIS Debate, Some observations, by Enzo Tiezzi
<br />
<p>1) Constraints, Carrying capacity
<br />
<p>The system in which we live, the planet Earth, is a finite system, and
<br />
as such has constraints. Physical reality is therefore subject to
<br />
constraints which determine limits. The term &quot;carrying capacity&quot; refers
<br />
to the capacity of the planet to sustain a growing population. In these
<br />
last years, the verb &quot;to carry&quot; has been replaced most of times with &quot;to
<br />
sustain&quot; (implying duration in time) which gave rise to the idea of
<br />
sustainable development.
<br />
The difference between the fast tempos of technological growth and the
<br />
slower tempos of the biological sphere, is at the core of the
<br />
environmental crisis. To create a steady state of slow growth in the
<br />
society means maintaining the energy flux at a constant low level,
<br />
slowing the entropic process, favouring decentralization and the small
<br />
scale, using renewable resources.
<br />
<p>Growth vs. development, Steady-state economics, Natural capital
<br />
To grow means &quot;to increase naturally in size by the addition of material
<br />
through assimilation or accretion&quot;. To develop means &quot;to expand or
<br />
realise the potentialities of; bring gradually to a full, greater or
<br />
better state&quot;. In short, growth is quantitative increase in physical
<br />
scale, while development is qualitative improvement or unfolding of
<br />
potentialities.
<br />
The integration of economics, ecology and thermodynamics gives rise to
<br />
the new theory of ecological economics, or sustainability, which has
<br />
nothing to do with that bad oxymoron &quot;sustainable growth&quot;.
<br />
We should adopt the biological model of steady state: evolution with
<br />
minimum production of entropy and maximum thermodynamic efficiency. The
<br />
steady state in biology does not mean renouncing development. Natural
<br />
history is the history of biological evolution, of systems in continuous
<br />
dynamic variation. The steady state does not negate evolution (and
<br />
development), it guarantees it.
<br />
The two golden rules on which it is based are due to Herman Daly:
<br />
I) harvest rates should be equal to regeneration rates (sustainable
<br />
yield);
<br />
II) waste emission rates should be equal to the natural assimilative
<br />
capacities of the ecosystems into which the wastes are emitted.
<br />
Regenerative and assimilative capacities must be treated as natural
<br />
capital, and failure to maintain these capacities must be treated as
<br />
capital consumption and therefore not sustainable. Natural capital and
<br />
man-made capital are complementary and natural capital has become the
<br />
limiting factor.
<br />
Calculations on natural capital (Nature, 387, 253-60, 1997) indicate
<br />
that the wealth produced by humans from nature is far greater then the
<br />
global gross national product.
<br />
<p><p>2) Thermodynamic foolishness: some considerations
<br />
<p>Thermodynamics' second principle, one of nature's fundamental laws,
<br />
addresses the pathways we should avoid in order to keep life on Earth.
<br />
It shows the universal, inescapable tendency toward disorder (in
<br />
thermodynamics, the general trend toward a entropy maximum), which is
<br />
also a loss of information and of usable energy availability. This
<br />
tendency to the Clausius' &quot;thermal death&quot;, takes to the thermodynamic
<br />
equilibrium, namely the death of biological systems and ecosystems,
<br />
through the destruction of diversities.
<br />
There are two ways to achieve such a condition:
<br />
a) when, through energy exchanges as heat fluxes, there are no more
<br />
differences in temperature and nothing more can be done, because any
<br />
exchange of usable energy is allowed;
<br />
b) when a system, becoming isolated, consumes its resources, reaching a
<br />
great increase in its internal entropy and, at the end, to
<br />
self-destruction.
<br />
For this reason living systems try to avoid the condition of
<br />
thermodynamic equilibrium, keeping themselves as far as possible from
<br />
that state, self-organizing due to material and energetic fluxes,
<br />
received from outside and from systems with different conditions of
<br />
temperature and energy.
<br />
Economics and our society cannot be unaware of thermodynamics' second
<br />
principle. As a consequence globalization, the destruction of both
<br />
biological and cultural diversities, homogenization and the unique
<br />
thought take inescapably to the thermal death (or to the &quot;entropic
<br />
euthanasia&quot;, as we called it), to the final destruction.
<br />
In the same way a country, a nation, a system that makes a political
<br />
dogma of its isolation, of its refusing of cultural contamination
<br />
(better: of cross-fertilizations), of its castling on fundamentalist
<br />
positions of self-conservation, will go to the same end. An excessive
<br />
defence of one's diversity and a complete loss of diversity are two
<br />
faces of the same thermodynamic foolishness.
<br />
<p>3) A new paradigm: from a space to a time culture
<br />
<p>Sustainable development needs the reformulation of some fundamental
<br />
premises of the western thought. A critique of contemporary science must
<br />
look for a transdisciplinar perspective, and be able to seek the basic
<br />
elements of a multidimensional and multilfocused paradigm, in order to
<br />
fully describe the relations, quality and complexity of reality.
<br />
The relationship between thermodynamics and sustainability is mainly due
<br />
to the attention that thermodynamics gives to the biophysical boundaries
<br />
that represent a constraint for the global environment. More
<br />
specifically, sustainability finds a precious contribute in the
<br />
ecodynamic models, which represent a synthesis between environmental
<br />
physical chemistry and ecology.
<br />
Sustainability needs also to consider the anthropic presence as a
<br />
subsystem of the whole biosphere, which can be assumed as a
<br />
thermodynamic closed system, exchanging energy but not matter with the
<br />
external sink (except a minimum dust or meteorite). Regarding every
<br />
human activity as a part of a whole system is a basic step for the
<br />
evaluation of the carrying capacity of the Earth.
<br />
The most relevant scientific reference for sustainable development's
<br />
models is thermodynamics of far from equilibrium systems, studied by
<br />
Ilya Prigogine.
<br />
We can consider the whole biosphere as a closed system in steady-state,
<br />
far from equilibrium, in which a negentropic flow allows the creation of
<br />
dissipative structures, complexity, new information, biodiversity,
<br />
relationships.
<br />
The switch to a vision of the interactions between man and nature as a
<br />
complex and non-linear system is a fundamental step, in order to abandon
<br />
the scientific reductionism that leads to abstract the single elements
<br />
of the system from the context of its properties and that draws an
<br />
oversimplified picture of nature (at the basis of the environmental
<br />
crisis).
<br />
The analysis of the evolution of a complex system underlines the
<br />
essential role of the time's arrow, which becomes a basic point to be
<br />
understood in the description of irreversibility. The reintroduction of
<br />
the time dimension in the scientific understanding allows moreover the
<br />
passage &quot;from a space to a time culture&quot;. Shifting our scientific
<br />
paradigm from being to becoming means to find the link between the human
<br />
and the natural sciences, as nature is considered no more like an
<br />
unchangeable reality, isolated, ruled by deterministic and absolute
<br />
laws, where human being is condemned to an always greater alienation,
<br />
once lost his original natural rootness.
<br />
So we can find a scientific way for the elaboration of an alternative to
<br />
the positivistic reductionism that has evicted all those perceptive
<br />
elements that contribute to the knowledge but are not characterized by
<br />
the repeatability and quantifiability claimed by the hard sciences. The
<br />
new paradigm for sciences should be an evolutive one. Dominant economic
<br />
theory, based as it is on mechanistic principles, remains ignorant of
<br />
the law of entropy and the role of the time variable. The classical
<br />
dynamic concept of time and its reversibility, has nothing to do with
<br />
reality and nature. Time is not without its preferred directions (it is
<br />
not isotropic) as is space. Time has a direction. Thermodynamics
<br />
introduces &quot;knowledge of the unidirectional flow of time&quot;, traces the
<br />
limit between past reality and future uncertainty, indicates the
<br />
orientation of time in natural processes.
