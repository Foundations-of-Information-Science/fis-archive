<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear John,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find very intriguing your paragraphs in response to Q1:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now, if self-organization is taken seriously, rather than merely as some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;vaguish metaphor, there must be something that is dissipated to create and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;maintain information. Furthermore, not just any dissipation will do; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;will have to be dissipation of something of the right sort to permit the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;relevant sort of information to form.. So, rather than give an answer, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ask the following questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What is dissipated in the production of information within the cell? Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;just energy, or is there a selection and disposal of information as well?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How much is the information budget of the cell hierarchical? Are the lowest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;levels primarily energetic, and does this continue in the same mode to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;higher levels, or are their specifically informational (control) levels in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the cell in which new information requires the dissipation of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;at lower levels?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My whole point about these questions is that you are inquiring about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unitary info--but what if biological info appears in several 'flavors'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Imagine that we are inquiring about a unitary 'force' in nature: probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we could not advance too far in our analysis unless we further distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the very different several forces at action (the 4 ones). Well, 'energy'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;came to the rescue providing the unitary entity, and appearing today for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many people as the necessary referent to conceptualize info. So the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cul-de-sac, in my opinion, as the different infos would be far closer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 'forces' category problem than to the 'energy' one.
</em><br />
<p>Well, we do talk about magnetic and gravitational energy. Conversion
<br />
between them is non-trivial. I suppose that a lot depends on whether
<br />
or not there is a general notion of information that is a common currency
<br />
notion like energy. Even with forces, there can be a resultant that is
<br />
a vector sum of different kinds acting on a given body. Is there anything
<br />
similar in the case of information? I suspect that there is, but I wouldn't 
<br />
want
<br />
my question above to turn on this. As I was writing it I realized that a) the
<br />
answer, if any depends on the type of information we are talking about,
<br />
and b) the specific type of dissipation might vary according to the type
<br />
of biological information involved, and even according to where it might lie
<br />
in some hierarchy of self-organization. Your point is quite apt. Even if there
<br />
is a common currency of information at some level of abstraction, the
<br />
specifics of each kind of information, or what is called information by
<br />
some, need to be articulated individually.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For me the living cell is the theater of at least three different info
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;varieties or forms (or processes?), structural, generative, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communicational, interlinked in a variety of ways; and probably it should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be four ones, as the above 'structural' implies lumping together the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mission of membranes, proteins, enzymes, metabolites...  plus the crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;antithetic work performed by constructive ribosomes / degradative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proteasomes. It looks an unsatisfying scheme, for myself too, but at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provides room for making some further discussion of a family of related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concepts: representation, symmetry, function, life cycle, teleology... It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also highlights the unilaterality of those who think that enzymes only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interact by low-energy non-covalent bonds with their surrounds (Barham),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;looking only at one type of communicational processes. But what about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multitude of enzymes and proteins who suffer modification by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phosphorilation, dephosphorilation, methylation, acetylation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proteolisis...  aren't these interactions covalent?, and aren´t they quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;crucial in gene expression (histone-code), cycle control, and even the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;signaling system itself?  So my message is about not lumping together the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;info dynamics (emphasis added on the 's') of the living cell under one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;single category, otherwise we will always been talking about incoherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;properties, and we will never produce an interesting chart of the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bioinfo territory.
</em><br />
<p>In other work with Jack Maze, a botanist, I have looked at how
<br />
energy dissipation is involved in the formation of biological structure.
<br />
I think it is generally true that in biology what we are inclined
<br />
to call structure of the first sort you mention is either programmed
<br />
or else arises through energy dissipation.
<br />
<p>The second sort of structure you mention (and I agree with the
<br />
distinction) is more like the next case, I think, and may not fit the
<br />
energy into structure model, though energy dissipation lies under
<br />
all dissipative processes.
<br />
<p>On the other hand, there is an aspect of information communication
<br />
that is very hard to deny in biology, involving hereditary transmission,
<br />
especially via the genes. In this case the informational aspects are
<br />
largely decoupled form the energetic aspects, and although the energy
<br />
budget must balance properly, it is the form and relations of form that
<br />
are most important. In this case I think that information, or form
<br />
dissipation is the most significant explanatorily. In general, I think
<br />
this applies to the biological subsystems that are most readily
<br />
called codes (see, e.g., Marcello Barbieri, The Organic Codes:
<br />
The Birth of Semantic Biology,  peQuod, 2001). These best fit
<br />
the model of a physical information system that I used in my own
<br />
paper for FIS 2002.
<br />
<p>I find the cases that involve signalling and control that don't fit the
<br />
code model (arbitrary, systematic rule-governed) to be the most
<br />
vexing. They sit somewhere between. I think these will be the hardest
<br />
cases.
<br />
<p>The generative case, as I suggested above, seems to me to break
<br />
down into the transmitted-programmed and the self-organizational
<br />
spontaneous. Then the first of these can be either a code based
<br />
type, or the more problematic sort of signalling.
<br />
<p>Anyway, It wasn't my intention to suggest that there was any
<br />
obvious unitary form of biological information, and I am glad
<br />
that you raised this. Even if there were, as I said, we would still
<br />
need to explain the differentiae for the types of cases that you
<br />
describe, and they may have little of real interest in common.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the brain, I think it is obvious that the formation of new information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;requires the rejection of dissonant information. Higher level concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;aren't merely the sum of a lot of lower level instances, but act as filters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that sort and reject information. The question I ask is, can this be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;usefully reduced purely to the processing of energy, or is there a special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;sort of dissipation related to the formation of concepts? Alternatively, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;concept formation not really a case of self-organization, but merely a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;fancy sort of reorganization that produces no new constraints?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I much agree with the special dissipation idea, perhaps placing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emphasis towards what I called 'abduction'.
</em><br />
<p>This seems right to me. I had not thought of it before. Edelman, and
<br />
my former psychology teacher, Stephen Chorover, back in the late
<br />
60's, have both suggested a sort of neural selection (Chorover proposed
<br />
that learning occurs through loss of neural connections alone,
<br />
which seems today to be empirically false). I have never found this
<br />
idea especially enlightening, but the abduction idea is much richer.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The capacity to selectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destroy masses of info that we throw into irrelevence. Take the case of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laughter: as we argue in the final version of the fis 2002 paper (have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look, it is brand-new) laughter makes much sense in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;info-hyper-saturated environment of human groups --as a genuine 'info
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destroyer'. It throws into irrelevance items that had undeservedly taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the attentional resources--and it leaves a pleasant background of generic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bonding among the co-laughing people. Again we are pretty unsatisfied with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the analysis we have done (although it includes intriguing formal chaotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;traces), but we believe that it serves to highlight laughter as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'protophenomenon' of human socioinfo, strategically converging groupal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emotional, cognitive &amp; neurodynamic strands.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The same questions can be asked at the firm level, but here we may also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;have dissipation at the social level of communications and perhaps other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;resources. What are the relevant resources? ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mark Burch and I extended our treatment of rhythmic entrainment, in both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the reorganization and self-organization cases to the social level: &quot;Order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From Rhythmic Entrainment and the Origin of Levels Through Dissipation&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree that 'Rhythmic Entrainment' looks a very important organizing item.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let us think for instance on the inevitable economic cycles. But how could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we connect your idea with the very info structures on which firms and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;markets are founded? I mean, inventions such as money, prices, accounting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems, markets, stocks...? Could other FISers produce their suggestions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the 'info granularities' that emerge along the time dimension of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;economic systems?
</em><br />
<p>I leave this one to others. My interests have been more in political process.
<br />
Anyone who knows me knows that money is not a major interest of mine.
