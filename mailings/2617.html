Reply to Richard:
<br />
<p>I do not wish to prolong the discussions since we are in a state of summing
<br />
up – but since you refer to my view I nevertheless feel obliged to point out
<br />
that you, to my mind, totally got hold of the wrong end of the stick
<br />
regarding this Summer’s FIS-discussions about scientific modelling.
<br />
<p>RRRR: Coming from a different persuasion, I have to ask if Arne's remarks
<br />
apply only to one kind of informational context­an &quot;experiential&quot;
<br />
one.  If I shift the focus to a biological context, where genes are
<br />
replicated and transcribed as digital information, I see no need
<br />
whatsoever for the human mind to project a psycho-philosophical
<br />
principle onto such non-human aspects of nature.
<br />
<p>AAAA: You must not play trick on yourself. Since we are all knowers, in one
<br />
way or other, the “insight” that genes replicate by digital information is
<br />
just a model constructed by a scientific observer/knower in a biological
<br />
context and as such human experience.
<br />
<p>RRRR: Maybe we are still reeling from the Anthropic Principle.  When we
<br />
speak of information,
<br />
in my opinion, we too often stray into this &quot;experiential&quot; territory
<br />
and ignore other natural communicators that don't have experiences.
<br />
<p>AAAA: Even if a defined entity lacks of experience, this very entity and its
<br />
method of communicating must be described by a model, which is also the
<br />
result of a knower’s experience.
<br />
<p>RRRR: So, I want to know how THEY are communicated in space and time.  From
<br />
my perspective, I might see genomes as confederations of selfish
<br />
genes and their alleles­entirely digital in their domain­operating by
<br />
some vague principle that may also apply elsewhere, perhaps even
<br />
gravitationally and quantum mechanically.
<br />
<p>AAAA: All our knowledge about entities – no matter whether they are believed
<br />
to be real or unreal entities exists in forms of experience that are 
<br />
condensed into
<br />
models.
<br />
<p>RRRR: But a few still need to see things hierarchically, as if Mind or God
<br />
sits on top, pulling along everything that occurs from moment to
<br />
moment in space and time.  Why should this be a first principle?
<br />
<p>AAAA: The privacy of subjectivity is a fully (?) shared human experience and
<br />
therefore a useful one. Nobody doubts its validity. Since experience resides
<br />
in your mind the “pulling along” goes on in your mind – and nowhere else.
<br />
Without knowing minds there is no knowledge – neither private nor
<br />
consensual. However the starting point of human epistemology must be the 
<br />
individual’s
<br />
personal experience – a base of knowledge that in the course of time can be
<br />
widened into social consensus. But not any further!
<br />
<p><p>RRRR: Why couldn't some argument of parallel universes provide a better
<br />
explanation on what information actually is and how it is communicated in
<br />
nature.
<br />
<p>AAAA: Well the SOA exactly highlights this aspect of human experience – that
<br />
there are as many universes (or rather priverses) as there are living
<br />
beings. This point of view is very useful and lacks of contradictions and in
<br />
this sense better. Unfortunately very few are willing to subscribe to this
<br />
view because they –like you - are brought up in the spirit of realism.
<br />
<p>RRRR: Sadly, life in nature remains an embarrassing enigma for biologists,
<br />
physicists, and informologists alike.  No hierarchical principle will ever
<br />
take us to a clear understanding of a biological kind of life that, for 
<br />
billions of
<br />
years, needed no &quot;personal awareness&quot; by anyone in order to
<br />
continuously communication genetic information and evolve all sorts
<br />
of organismic &quot;messages.&quot;  And those ethereal digits outlived their
<br />
fleshy expressions by millions and millions of years.
<br />
<p>AAAA: But I cannot understand how you can fail to see that this process of
<br />
evolutional recontruction is just another model made by a knower or group of
<br />
knowers. One might restate this saying by  – life was there sure, but
<br />
knowledge=organised experience did not occur until the first mind entered
<br />
the scene.
<br />
<p>RRRR: We are like astronomers before Hubble who observed the Milky Way with
<br />
a deep sense of mystery­evidence, perhaps, of heavenly meddling­until
<br />
the concept of galaxies was clearly understood.  Suddenly there was
<br />
no longer any need for hierarchical models that invoke, tacitly or
<br />
not, a higher Communicator.  For me, at least, not a lot of useful
<br />
stuff comes from the glorification of &quot;experience&quot; and the
<br />
castigation of &quot;dualism.&quot;  Something very important is still unknown
<br />
about what the &quot;information of life&quot; really is­if it is not digitally
<br />
genetic­and I am betting that when it is discovered it will NOT be
<br />
some kind of an &quot;experience.&quot;
<br />
<p>AAAA: This is just another model – living in the minds (experience) of
<br />
cosmologists.
<br />
<p>AAAA: In a way you in your failing to see the experimenter’s/knower’s
<br />
dilemma highlights what the Summer’s FIS discussion and the Einstein/Bohr as
<br />
well as the earlier Boltzmann/Mach controversy is about - namely the
<br />
observer/knower’s capacity of finding out what is “really happening” out
<br />
there. My claim is that the human capacity of perception does not allow the
<br />
observer to find out what is “really going on” – and it seems also Andrei
<br />
and Pedro agree that this is impossible and therefore the knower MUST IN
<br />
PRINCIPLE be content with working with a MODEL of what is going on.
<br />
(Otherwise he in principle claims that the “out there” is in his mind, which
<br />
obviously is a contradiction!)
<br />
<p>The observer cannot find out what is “going on out there” because his mind
<br />
is “wired up” by feed-back loops that effectively ruins the possibility to
<br />
reconstruct the “real” happenings “out there” as well as he is also unable
<br />
to from explicating the essence of “things.”
<br />
<p>However there is no need of doing so in acts of prediction – because he can
<br />
very well predict what is going to happen in his experience to avoid the
<br />
dangers of “reality” – as long he has a useful model of this reality. By way
<br />
of probability reasoning we can make probable (not 100% certain) but very
<br />
probably (a belief) there is a “reality out there.” This is a useful
<br />
hypothesis – but the very problem for classical science is that this
<br />
“reality” is not directly knowable (or knowable by perception). No knower is
<br />
able to extract certain knowledge of “reality.” He must be content with
<br />
probable knowledge and furthermore this knowledge is accessible to him only
<br />
in the form of experience – he has no access to the “real world”
<br />
whatsoever – even if we generally think so and here lies the mistake!
<br />
<p>When lacks of access to the “real world” – because of his feed-back “wired”
<br />
perceptual capacity – then it is in principle misleading to postulate two
<br />
different domains of scientific discourse. This is why realism with its
<br />
dualism is misleading. Once one understands that a scientific knower – as an
<br />
individual or a group – can do science very well in one single domain
<br />
(monism) one are also forced to take on the Subject-Oriented Approach –
<br />
which is a different scientific methodology that houses processes of
<br />
reversed causation and therefore confusing to a mind trained in the thinking
<br />
of realism.
<br />
<p>Once monism is established there is no need of “information” as
<br />
communicators since there is only one domain of experience. Then information
<br />
is a descriptor (most often numbers) we use to specify (quantify) the type
<br />
of feel we experience (qualia).
<br />
<p>Summing up: We cannot know what is “out there” by observation because living
<br />
beings do not have such a capacity. We cannot reconstruct a certain
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;“reality” outgoing from experience. Then it is misleading to speak of a
<br />
“reality” that we are able to know by direct acquaintance. We know “reality”
<br />
only as a hypothesis and a NAME – its features are hidden but we GUESS its
<br />
features by the use of scientific models. However these features just
<br />
reflect the human capacity to feel – nothing else. These guesses (models)
<br />
are later tested and confirmed against our personal experience – and against
<br />
our hypothetical(imaginary) reality. When the models work in prediction – we
<br />
classify them useful and stick to them – otherwise we modify them. However a
<br />
hypothetical reality is not a “real” one - it is a construction and belongs
<br />
to the mental domain!!!  This is why some thinkers claim: “Reality is an
<br />
illusion – albeit a stable one !” Dreams are alike – but not stable – at
<br />
least not my!  To my mind information is an interpersonal communicator –
<br />
data (numbers) we use to weigh human experience of otherwise unspeakable
<br />
feelings.
<br />
<p>You must not think you, anyone else, or science can know what is “out
<br />
there” – without the use of a mind (experiential mind) – specifically your
<br />
own. This is why information has no mind-independent existence – information
<br />
is mind-dependent and depends on your personal experience. This is why we
<br />
have to join in consensus and “tune” our minds to allow for communication.
<br />
We do this by learning and coexistence – and by the use of languages
<br />
(models). We are unable to know what “really goes on out there” by direct
<br />
evidence. This is why we should prefer to choose monism since “out there”
<br />
does not exist in a monistic science – all you know is experience. And what
<br />
you cannot experience you cannot know – and neither speak of.
<br />
<p>However to a scientist there is no need to speak and know about some
<br />
illusory reality – we can do the job of predicting coming personal
<br />
experience anyway – and do it successfully!!!
<br />
<p>By the way, Andrei, I now see the need of conceptual “transformers” in
<br />
monistic communication. What is misleading, as I see it, is “information” as
<br />
a “mediator” between two different domains (real/unreal) – for the reason
<br />
this very distinction is misleading. But this might be the start of a coming
<br />
discussion?
