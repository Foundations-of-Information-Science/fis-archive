<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Luis and Shu-Kun responses to Xerman were relating information and entropy, 
<br />
and 'exergy' (or usable work---the first time this concept appears in our 
<br />
discussions). I think it is a very good idea relating the management of 
<br />
'exergy' in the cell with the contemporary engineering approaches to 
<br />
'thermoeconomics'. And that one, again, is a new, strange term; it attempts 
<br />
a bridge between the universe of physics and the universe of human monetary 
<br />
information. Other 'bridges' have appeared in very recent exchanges: sets 
<br />
and group theory, chemistry &amp; maths, sets &amp; words (thesaurus)... In this 
<br />
labyrinth of bridges (as most of them are interconnected), it seems that 
<br />
those between physics and information attract permanently our attention, 
<br />
like a magnet. Seemingly, the field of studies of 'information physics' 
<br />
would be crucial to solve our global conundrum about info.
<br />
<p>Really? I was trying to locate in our fis web-archive those 10 points that 
<br />
Igor proposed us, around 5 years ago, as sort of foundations for 
<br />
'information physics'. It would be interesting to re-read them and compare 
<br />
with the new avenues now proposed (can anyone locate that old 
<br />
message--unfortunately it is missing in our archives). The idea I would 
<br />
like to relate with all these old and new messages is that the whole world 
<br />
of 'molecular recognition' phenomena that occur in the cell, represent a 
<br />
universal solution to a tough problem of mechanics: the relationship with 
<br />
the boundary conditions.
<br />
<p>The non living just follows its boundary conditions (and interacts with), 
<br />
as its 'charge' parameters (mass included) call into action the 
<br />
corresponding natural laws or forces. But the living system, as a whole, 
<br />
does something else: it manages to explore its boundary conditions and 
<br />
literally exploits them (enacting its own living). Then? I think that this 
<br />
strange capability (to which we label rather confusingly with several ad 
<br />
hoc terms such as sensibility, purpose, adaptation, evolution, etc.) might 
<br />
be best caught globally by the concept of 'abduction'. So, contrary to the 
<br />
inanimate, the animate has a funny informational organization based on a 
<br />
myriad of molecular recognition events that handle, accumulate, transfer, 
<br />
etc., the whole 'knowledge' about abducing the boundary conditions of the 
<br />
system. My view is that the very biomolecules crucially in charge of 
<br />
controlling the system (enzymes) contain in their structure an 'impressed 
<br />
mark' about the abductive dynamics they support.
<br />
<p>When the founding fathers of molecular biology --all of them staunchest 
<br />
reductionists-- advanced their new science in the 50's and 60's, they 
<br />
intuitively crafted their concepts out from the information metaphor: code, 
<br />
expression, transcription, translation, signals, messages, messengers, etc. 
<br />
(why not from forces and mechanics???) Well, they did not much care about 
<br />
making sense of these subtle theoretical problems that are now plaguing, 
<br />
for instance, the bioinformatic crew. Perhaps these problems systematically 
<br />
reappear, under different guises, in other 'informational disciplines' such 
<br />
as neuroscience, psychology, economics ('thermoeconomics' included), social 
<br />
sciences, etc. Maybe the infamous breach between the natural sciences and 
<br />
the humanities is nothing but the information gap.
<br />
<p>I am much enjoying the elegant postings of these days.
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
