I cannot see that the concept of fitness is now &quot;obsolete&quot;.
<br />
In the opposite, I believe it is still of great actuality

in spite of the fact that so far nobody is able to quantify it

in a way we know from theoretical physics i.e. as Hamilton-principle.&lt;
<br />
<p>[Stockinger]
<br />
<p>Do Hamilton functions (sorry I´m not very familiar with them) supply
<br />
fitness quantification formulas? Maybe in the way we could use them or
<br />
adapt them at a sociological level, in combination with info-theoretical
<br />
aspects (?). Please, if possible, may you give a short explanation?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think we have to continue to work on the concept  of fitness and in this
</em><br />
sense I would support here the view of Stockinger about fitness.&lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
A (post- or neo-)darwinian view of fitness, as it has &quot;survived&quot; until
<br />
today, seems realy still to be &quot;fit&quot; enough to continue to work with. In
<br />
sociology, of course, one deals with a very complex value-landscape or
<br />
value-systems, as Artigiani and others have already pointed out (naming it
<br />
VEMs) . They tried to show its evolution by information-inputs coming from
<br />
both, the environment and the social system itself, and did well.
<br />
To go on, in the evolution of such a value-system (institutionalized in
<br />
habits,
<br />
roles, rituals...) certain values and roles etc. are selected because of
<br />
their fitness (to deal with human problems in everyday life), others are
<br />
not.
<br />
But, what really matters is that social evolution historically led to a
<br />
greater variety in the value-landscape. VEMs which have been repressed
<br />
(declared non-fit) are now admitted (declared fit). So one may not talk
<br />
only of the survival of the fittest, but of their (say geometrical)
<br />
multiplication, .
<br />
Of course, there are several  theoretical considerations which guide the
<br />
research on information society and its evolution. Only some of them,
<br />
although important ones IMO,  deal with the role of social fitness linked
<br />
to
<br />
social variety.
<br />
Using certain analogies to biological transformations, important elements
<br />
for the transformation of information-guided behaviour systems (cultures)
<br />
may be observed. (Maybe Ebeling can come up with physical analogies?). A
<br />
variety of elements respond for changes in the social value-system of all
<br />
kinds of organisations like states,  partys, enterprises, groups, clans,
<br />
hords, insofar as these changes aim the optimation of functional
<br />
effectivity in dependence of the variety and its use by the social system's
<br />
elements (events, acts).
<br />
Collectivities (&quot;societies&quot;) are able to explore  socio-cultural
<br />
information variety to &quot;cause&quot; changes. They instruct and functionalise
<br />
emerging information through feedback in such a way, that they get better
<br />
chances to reach certain local values of &quot;fitness&quot; and get &quot;selected&quot;. One
<br />
may say, that they are fitter in the sense of &quot;better instructed&quot;.
<br />
If social change and variety are optimised, the replication of the system
<br />
works close to a &quot;treshold of error&quot;, that means that transformation
<br />
processes are driven to a dynamic equilibrium between stabiliy and
<br />
creativity  A variety of new VEM-operators emerges. Former dominant VEMs
<br />
are still reproducted, but a lot of other alternatives, stabilised by
<br />
mutual separation are also represented in a survivable concentration and
<br />
quantity.
<br />
A more flexible society (a more &quot;free&quot; one?) emerges. And its IMO fitter to
<br />
survive within the new circumstances (about which we may still talk about).
