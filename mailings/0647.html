<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any property plays this role, I think only that many properties may do.)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What do you think?
</em><br />
<p>Dear Gyuri,
<br />
<p>That is an interesting observation about open systems. Personally, I am 
<br />
inclined to agree with your suggestion, but others who have a more 
<br />
restricted notion of information will not be so ready. In any case, I think 
<br />
that Pedro's observation that there are different kinds of information, 
<br />
like different kinds of forces (the analogy is weak, I think, and it would 
<br />
be nice to find a stronger one), suggests that there may still be a problem 
<br />
with understanding how different kinds of information might be convertible. 
<br />
Even in an open system in which we can talk of information flows in and 
<br />
out, any internally emergent information may be of another kind than the 
<br />
flows. This seems to be required for the emergence of new kinds of 
<br />
information (e.g., codes, intentional information). So I think Pedro's 
<br />
problem still stands. On the other hand, your suggestion does focus on the 
<br />
issue of what conditions must hold for information of one type (or some 
<br />
sort of proto-information) to dynamically emerge as another kind of 
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>I must confess that I have not taken this problem very seriously so far, 
<br />
since I have been working with what I understand to be a unitary notion of 
<br />
information that is close to, but not the same as the &quot;it from bit&quot; view. 
<br />
(I restrict &quot;its&quot; to macrostates, basically, adopting the negentropy 
<br />
principle of information, so I would not accept what David Layzer calls 
<br />
&quot;microinformation&quot; in his 1975 Scientific American article, Layzer, David. 
<br />
1975. The arrow of time. Scientific American 233: 56-69 as information.) In 
<br />
this case, any macroscopic order that emerges would be information. So I 
<br />
have concentrated on 1) how previous information systems can &quot;recruit&quot; 
<br />
potential information, and 2) how new kinds of information can be formed by 
<br />
special conditions under which self-organization occurs. The second problem 
<br />
is really just another version of the conversion problem, so it can't be 
<br />
avoided, I think, but perhaps the best view is one that mitigates the 
<br />
problems in understanding conversion most effectively. Incidentally, this 
<br />
problem is one that our small group at Fuschl found to be very pressing, 
<br />
and one that discussions in Vienna with Wolfgang Hoffkirchner and his group 
<br />
keep coming back to. I don't think that the common issue has anything to do 
<br />
with my more or less accidental participation in both groups -- it seems to 
<br />
arise out of the definition of the problem, which was set long before my 
<br />
participation. So I expect that other people and groups have come up 
<br />
against the same issue in one form or another, which might be called &quot;the 
<br />
conversion problem&quot;.
<br />
<p>The conversion problem may have no single solution for all kinds of 
<br />
information and proto-information. On the other hand, I think that some 
<br />
sort of solution is required for a unified theory of information.
