This is my reply to Jerry  (acknowledging that John's reply to Jerry below
<br />
says it as well as -- probably better than -- I can), who said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stan's comment deserves to be attended to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;The many complexities facing us as society can be parsed as follows,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specification hierarcy:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; {physical constraints (material/chemical constraints {biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constraints {sociocultural constraints}}}}.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I search for the substance in this comment, I focus on what might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the potentially misleading usage of the term &quot;parsed.&quot;
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: 'Parsed', as I use it loosely here, is just 'to divide into
<br />
component parts', as with a sentence -- {man {running {uphill {chasing his
<br />
hat {naked}}}}} -- the order here is not important. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nor, do I understand why brackets, signifiers of separations, are used in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this context.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: The set theoretic brackets are used here, as John says, to indicate
<br />
the logical relations between realms of nature, as we have constructed
<br />
them.  So, as we think biology emerged from chemistry, we can note this as
<br />
{chemistry {biology}}.  This  -- importantly -- means that biology further
<br />
constrains (the traditional usage here is 'integrates') chemistry by
<br />
instituting rules that limit what chemistry may do in biologial systems.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no idea what it would mean to &quot;parse&quot; a &quot;material / chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraint&quot; in this context.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S:  I feel free to use a grammatical operation like this when
<br />
linguistically dealing with scientific concepts because our concepts ARE,
<br />
indeed, just grammatical / logical constructs.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, chemical logic functions in exactly the opposite direction.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The creative relations grow with the complexity of the system. Is this not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what we mean by evolution?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: This elicits, as John notes, an interesting philosophical point.
<br />
The logic as I have used it indeed says that as evolution uncovers new
<br />
realms of nature, these are MORE restricted in their freedom than were
<br />
prior existing realms (in the ways that these prior realms were free to
<br />
explore).  Each emergence reduces degrees of freedom that were open in
<br />
prior realms.  An example I like to use is language.  As we learn a
<br />
language, it opens up immense possibilties for unique statements, BUT it
<br />
closes off possibilties that might have been opened up if we had learned
<br />
another language instead (recall the Whorffian hypothesis), and, I believe,
<br />
it blots out some intuitive aspects of our cognition just by intense mental
<br />
focusing on language.  So, a tornado is freer to attain different forms in
<br />
different locales than is an organism.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On a personal note to Stan: We have been discussing similar concepts since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the inception of WESS more than 20 years ago and it does not appear that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we are converging!  :-)  :-)  :-) Unless you choose to embrace the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creative capacities of chemical logic, I fear your mind is doomed to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;purgatory of unending chaotic cycles, searching for a few elusive or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perhaps imaginary &quot;fixed points.&quot;  ;-)  :-) :-( !!!
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S:  I think the main problem in this particular case is that you need
<br />
to note the exact meaning of the set theoretic brackets.  Having noted
<br />
that, then you would have understood -- even if not agreed.
<br />
<p>John said --
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Hi folks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll take a few minutes from my moving and dealing with academic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emergencies at UKZN to make a comment here.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S; No wonder I haven't been able to contact you!
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jerry brings up a point that keeps arising in the literature one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraints and information. Recall that Shannon said that they are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same thing. That is a clue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-snip-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stan's bracket formulation is a logical restriction (constraint), with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the outer bracketed items logically restricting the inner ones. It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neat formulation for a system developed by W.E. Johnson in his book Logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in which he called the inner elements determinates and the outer ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;determinables. The idea is a basic one in the Philosophy business, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these are the technical terms used there, although they are somewhat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;awkward, being relative terms, and also not words used with their English
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning. Jerry's problem is that if the chemical opens up a huge range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibilities not available to the physical, how can we call the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a constraint on the chemical. I once asked Stan a similar question, and he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gave me an answer that satisfied me enough not to pursue the issue. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer requires a distinction concerning constraints (which, recall, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logically equivalent to information -- any connotative difference being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;irrelevant to my point here). My colleagues and coauthors Wayne
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christensen and Cliff Hooker once referred to the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;restricting and enabling constraints. The former restrict possibilities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;while the latter are required in order to make things possible -- mush
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produces nothing. But there is no essential difference -- context, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anything, makes the difference. I say 'if anything' because in many cases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraints (indistinguishable from information by logic alone) do both:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;restrict and enable. There is no paradox here -- they are two sides of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same coin. A Taoist like me sees them as Yin and Yang -- the Yang element
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the defined and restrictive, active, controlling part, while the Yin is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the open, receptive and enabling part. We cannot view the same thing as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both Yin and Yang at the same time (we can talk about it in the abstract,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the same way that we can talk about Cartesian and polar coordinates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;together, and even transform them on in to the other), but the thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself is both, and the transformations between Yin and Yang have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical form that is predictable and determinate. Just so with restricting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and enabling constraints -- we can learn to transform one into the other,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both in thought and in practice.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S: A new realm of Nature, while closing off / fixing many degrees of
<br />
freedom still open in the prior realms of nature, opens up NEW degrees of
<br />
freedom at the higher integrative level.  Thus, flying and running would
<br />
not look very different if seen from a protein's point of view within a
<br />
muscle, but it marks a significant difference at the biological level -- as
<br />
would 'flying up to the left' rather than 'down to the right'.  The new
<br />
degrees of freedom are enabled, while the old ones are restricted.
<br />
