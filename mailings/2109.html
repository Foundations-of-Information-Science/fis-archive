Dear friends
<br />
<p>I apologize in Bob's and my name for our delay in wraping-up this exciting 
<br />
session. Here it is:
<br />
<p>We started with the assumption that economies have two basic dimensions
<br />
of internal order: one is organic/organizational and relates to
<br />
functional and structural properties, which are closely related to
<br />
autocatalytic processes. The other is cognitive/informational, meaning
<br />
that the broad perspective that human agents hold on the world
<br />
streamlines collective human behavior and economic activities. Both
<br />
dimensions of order are maintained at the cost of dissipating the
<br />
fabric of the natural environment.
<br />
<p>Those social beliefs and shared values of the North lie behind welfare
<br />
liberalism. Not only do they drive economic globalization, but they
<br />
also promote economic efficiency as the supreme, universal social goal.
<br />
While it is true that autocatalysis promotes efficiency, without which
<br />
an economic community is liable to being displaced, the lesson from the
<br />
biological realm is that efficiency is not what sustains communities in
<br />
the long run. Diversity of processes and sectors implies the
<br />
co-existence of various degrees of efficiency and therefore various
<br />
modes of socioeconomic organization. Through the process of
<br />
globalization, welfare liberalism has been endangering biological and
<br />
cultural diversity, as well as the integrity of world ecosystems. We
<br />
identify this as a &quot;sustainability&quot; problem at the global level.
<br />
<p>In the past decade mainstream economics has proposed the idea of a
<br />
transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based economy,
<br />
arguing that this process has already started in the most advanced
<br />
market economies. This transition has been related, among other things,
<br />
to a trend in increasing economic efficiency (measured as GDP per unit
<br />
of energy or materials used) among the advanced market economies.
<br />
Overall consumption of energy and natural resources continues, however,
<br />
to increase in all &quot;developed&quot; economies, as well as in some
<br />
&quot;developing&quot; nations, like China and India, with increasingly
<br />
deleterious effects on regional ecosystems and possibly the global
<br />
climate.
<br />
<p>Stanley Salthe claimed that information transactions are superimposed
<br />
upon resource utilization, and that this raises a question as to the
<br />
appropriateness of the distinction between resource-based and
<br />
knowledge-based systems. It appears that the solution to the
<br />
sustainability problem is not in the transition from a resource to a
<br />
knowledge based economy, because both types are subject to
<br />
thermodynamic constraints (a point on which most of us agreed.) Rather,
<br />
the problem of sustainability, or of remaining within the economic
<br />
&quot;window of vitality&quot;, may lie in achieving a balance between efficiency
<br />
and diversity, which implies the necessity for allowing a certain
<br />
degree of &quot;overhead&quot; and performance sub-optimality to persist. As Loet
<br />
Leydesdorf remarked, neither the Western, nor any other economic
<br />
system, is sustainable in the long run, because it is always five
<br />
minutes before twelve (&quot;the edge of crisis&quot;) in any system that is in
<br />
full-swing operation.
<br />
<p>Gearing economic dynamics permanently below the &quot;full-swing operation&quot;,
<br />
while at the same time preserving the cohesinevess of the social
<br />
fabric, may point national economies and the global economic system in
<br />
the direction of susainability. This recapitulates our initial proposal
<br />
that it is necessary to reduce the intensity of autocatalytic processes
<br />
within the world economy to release the current pressure on ecosystem
<br />
sinks and sources as well as to diminish the pressure on cultural
<br />
diversity. In order for this process to begin, however, requires
<br />
drastic changes in the values, beliefs and institutions that dominate
<br />
Western societies. We do not know if, how or when the transition might
<br />
happen, but we all agree that information networks are likely to play
<br />
an important role in the process. The fact is that the internet is
<br />
enabling unprecedented exchange of information and knowledge across the
<br />
connected part of the globe, and it is bringing together like-minded
<br />
people from different cultural and economic environments.
<br />
<p>We agree that the details of the answer to what &quot;sustainability&quot; is and
<br />
how best it might be pursued lie in the realm of  political options for
<br />
individual societies. These political opitions are, however,
<br />
illuminated by scientific knowledge and the hope for achieving greater
<br />
sustainability is nourished by the ability of scientific community to
<br />
work together on complex transdisiplinary issues. We would like to
<br />
think that our FIS discussion was a step in that direction, and we
<br />
thank you for your thoughts and time.
<br />
<p>Bob &amp; Igor
