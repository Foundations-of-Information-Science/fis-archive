<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Given the delay of our volunteers, perhaps we could start up the neuro
<br />
discussion rather informally. As a provocation, I suggest the consideration
<br />
of the following initial topics (below). They are taken from some classical
<br />
discussions during the 70's and 80's by Horridge, Purves, Fox, etc. The
<br />
fine tuning and &quot;aggiornamento&quot; by our fis neuroscientists would be very
<br />
welcome.
<br />
<p><p><p>1. STRANGENESS OF NEURONS
<br />
<p>Indeed a very strange type of cell: amazing form, formidable cytoskeleton,
<br />
variable &quot;tree&quot; of synapses, multiplicity of differentiated neuronal
<br />
subtypes, lack of dividing capacity...
<br />
<p>Coupled to a very expensive functioning: maintenance of the membrane
<br />
electrical potential, very exaggerate patterns of gene expression,
<br />
hypertrophic signaling system activity, a very complex net of internal
<br />
transportations...
<br />
<p><p>2. ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF NERVOUS SYSTEMS
<br />
<p>Can we assume that the above very rare and expensive peculiarities are but
<br />
evolutionary responses to the &quot;info processing&quot; role that neurons started
<br />
to play for the sake of the whole multicellular organism?
<br />
<p>Or maybe, can we think that at the very beginning of animal evolution,
<br />
neurons were in charge of something else (&quot;trophic integration&quot;???), and
<br />
then info functions gradually took over and finally supersed the old
<br />
function?
<br />
<p>If so, instead of a neat info adaptation, neurons would be &quot;barroque&quot;
<br />
contraptions, and we could point to quite a few gross reminiscenses of the
<br />
old functions surviving eg, in the very mysterious molecular maintanance of
<br />
&quot;memory&quot;...
<br />
<p><p><p>3. EMERGENCE OF ABSTRACT PATTERNS
<br />
<p>In the combined dance of electrical discharges, neuromodulators, hormones,
<br />
growth and disappearance of synapses, cycles and rythms of activity... have
<br />
we finally found good approximations to a coherent set of abstract
<br />
operations which might grant learning, memory, and in general the
<br />
&quot;simulating&quot; capabilities of brains?
<br />
<p>In what extent some of the present (artificial) neural nets may be a sound
<br />
model for biological neurons?
<br />
<p>Do we have clear evidences about nonlinear phenomena, chaos, attractors,
<br />
etc. as regularly used as central processing tools within concrete brain
<br />
substructures? Or could they be mere epiphenomena stemming from a deeper
<br />
info processing strategy taking place?
<br />
<p><p><p>4. BEHAVIORAL EMERGENCE
<br />
<p>Hundreds and hundreds of maps are crammed into the brain of any
<br />
vertebrate--it is curious that, in comparison with the present glut of
<br />
neural net models, we have very few theories on info processing by means of
<br />
massive mapping (topological!) relationships...
<br />
<p>The physical organization of vertebrate brains (the packing of their
<br />
cortical maps) shows an optimized STRUCTURE --several authors agree. Do we
<br />
have serious hints that a similar optimizing process may occur concerning
<br />
the overall FUNCTION?
<br />
<p>In other words, do &quot;variational principles&quot; exist in order to orient the
<br />
combined info processing of the whole substructures of the vertebrate brain
<br />
granting the emergence of complex adaptive behavior? Or conversely, given
<br />
the present evidence on brain functioning, is the search for such an
<br />
overall &quot;variational principle&quot; underlying behavior a mere science-fiction
<br />
possibility?
<br />
<p><p><p>5. THE BRAIN VERSUS THE MIND: THE PHENOMENON OF CONSCIOUSNESS
<br />
<p>In what extent could consciousness be amenable to brain sci. analysis
<br />
(evolutionary plus neuroscientific)? Do we forcefully need to invoque
<br />
quantum phenomena--and even New Physics-- in order to scientifically talk
<br />
about mind and consciousness?
<br />
<p>Is it plausible that in the course of their bizarre evolutionary
<br />
trajectory, did nervous systems of mammals (primates) stumble upon New
<br />
Physics themes--and discovered &quot;consciousness&quot; as a quantum subatomic
<br />
epiphenomenon emerging from special protein-components of their
<br />
cytoskeletons? Perhaps even including, and integrating, the dynamics of
<br />
intracellular second messengers (as expostulated by Liberman)... and
<br />
crossing sort of a complexity threshold.
<br />
<p>If so, could such consciousness phenomena ever emerge from logically
<br />
&quot;shallow&quot; non-protein components (eg, Silicon components)? Is, then, the
<br />
fancy quest for Artificial Intelligence necessarily doomed, unless
<br />
reoriented towards the Biological processing?
<br />
<p>best greetings
<br />
<p>Pedro
