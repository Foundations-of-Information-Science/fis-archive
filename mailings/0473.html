<p>Because of the great divide concerning whether information exists
<br />
&quot;out there&quot; independently of an interpreter or whether it is something
<br />
that is created only through interpretation or intentionality, I have become
<br />
increasingly reluctant to talk of information. Partly this is because I
<br />
do not know what is at stake. It seems to me reasonable that two
<br />
people could interpret the same information differently. Given this,
<br />
it seems to me reasonable that information does not depend on
<br />
the specific interpretation. If the interpretation view is correct,
<br />
then it must require that there is some interpretation, but not a
<br />
specific interpretation, or else there could be no disagreement
<br />
about the interpretation of the same information. However, it seems
<br />
that at least some who take the intentional view also want information
<br />
to be something surprising to the one who is informed, making information
<br />
a very subject relative thing. This seems to make it very difficult
<br />
for two people to share information, especially to transmit it, since
<br />
presumably what is new to the recipient is not new to the transmitter.
<br />
Other misalignments of novelty are also quite possible.
<br />
<p>Now certainly there is a sense in which information is a measure
<br />
of the reduction of unexpectedness. How seriously are we to take
<br />
this intentional locution? Apparently, pretty much as seriously as we
<br />
want to. The flexibility is there, as the diverse views in this group
<br />
show over and over again. So a lot hangs on the wants. And that
<br />
is where I am not quite clear about what is at stake.
<br />
<p>In the case of nonintentional contexts, I have become increasingly
<br />
careful to talk of information capacity rather than information. This
<br />
is actually what Shannon was talking about, and it is all that is
<br />
required for both physics and mathematical communications
<br />
theory. These two notions place some constraints on information
<br />
proper, since physics limits what it is possible to embody, and
<br />
communications theory limits what it is possible to convey.
<br />
A theory of embodied conveying would be a very useful thing,
<br />
and I do not want it to get hung up on the issue of whether or not it
<br />
is really about information. Especially, I am have become quite
<br />
intolerant of arguments to the effect that since information depends
<br />
on the receiver information capacity depends on the receiver's
<br />
desires, prejudices, beliefs, whims, intelligence or stupidity. There
<br />
may be information there to be found but the receiver is just to
<br />
dense to notice it. We need a way to talk about that sort of
<br />
circumstance that is both systematic and integrated into a
<br />
general theory of information.
<br />
<p>I think that there is a lot to be said for integrating the notion of
<br />
information capacity with information, as Gyuri and Norbert
<br />
seem to be suggesting. There is a great deal of unifying power.
<br />
On the other hand, this unification would tend to obscure the
<br />
intentional aspect of information -- if one assumes that information
<br />
capacity is all there is to information.
<br />
<p>Personally, I find notions of meaning, intention, surprise,
<br />
expectation, and uncertainty rather obscure (except in some rigorous
<br />
mathematical and physical applications of surprise, expectation
<br />
and uncertainty -- but these are surely not the normal uses).
<br />
I wonder if we really want to found information theory on
<br />
such mysterious concepts. There are some philosophers,
<br />
e.g.,  the Churchlands, who think that there aren't really
<br />
such intentional things in the world at all. Would this mean
<br />
that there is no information?
<br />
<p>If we define information in intentional terms, does that mean
<br />
that information theory is hopelessly circular as an approach
<br />
to understanding intentionality and meaning?
<br />
<p>On the other hand, if we allow an physical system that
<br />
shows structure (&quot;it from bit&quot;) to contain information, are we
<br />
buying,  implicitly into some sort of panpsychism?
<br />
<p>I think that the answer to both of these questions is
<br />
&quot;no&quot;, and a satisfactory information theory will need to
<br />
make clear why the answer is negative in both cases.
<br />
<p>I must be away for a few days. I wanted to leave these
<br />
ruminations before I go.
