Loet said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would layer individual minds between the biology  (body) and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social. While the individual mind is still very constrained by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(&quot;structurally coupled&quot; to) the biological body, the communication between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;minds  allows for much more freedom.
</em><br />
<p>This is a perennial question, and I wish to register a different opinion.
<br />
We could have the formulation:
<br />
<p>{physical process {chemical connections {biological forms {social
<br />
conventions}}}}
<br />
<p>where this issue is skirted, taking either meaning.
<br />
<p>But I think it possible to suggest that there could not be minds, as we
<br />
spontaneously think of that term, without sociality (even in animals).  If
<br />
that is the case, then:
<br />
<p>{physical {material {biological {social {psychological}}}}} would be the
<br />
proper arrangement.
<br />
<p>Loet again said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Meaning has to preserved in hierarchies at the chemical and biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level.  In discourse, meaning can be &gt;deconstructed and reconstructed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore is  at variance.
</em><br />
<p>This is embodied in the above (specification) hierarchy by the fact that it
<br />
is formally a tree, branching to right.  Thus, the biological level has a
<br />
coordinate realm branching from the material realm in abiotic dissipative
<br />
structures.  Loet's &quot;variance&quot; would be embodied in the many socialities
<br />
that mightemerge from biology, and as well in the very many more
<br />
psychologies possible within each sociality.  In any case 'meaning is
<br />
preserved' throughout.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of my favorite aphorisms:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no good science that is vague,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and no good poetry that is not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- Fernando Pessoa
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly very true for poetry!  But the fact that science is
<br />
still only fully explicit is, in my opinion, a deficit that has delivered
<br />
us a mechanistic Nature, which serves as a very poor model of the World.
<br />
Of course, if the role of science is only to support technology, then my
<br />
remark here is irrelevant.  But I think many on this list think of science
<br />
rather as a way to understand the world.  Well, the world is in one degree
<br />
or other vague, while our pathetic models of it are (still) fully explicit.
