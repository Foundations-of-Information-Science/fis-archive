John,
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You replied to Chistoph
</em><br />
&lt;yes, but the difference does not just come from the progammer,
<br />
&lt;it comes basically from the kind of being
<br />
&lt;a robot is (in case it is not a *flesh* one... at least...
<br />
<p>I empathise with you here. Although if I were flying a plane I'd
<br />
rather receive my meaningful information from a computerised autopilot
<br />
than a fleshly comatose copilot.
<br />
Can an autopilot (or a thermostat, a digital TV or a chess program
<br />
like Brute Force)have a meaningful informational experience? &gt;
<br />
<p>John, I think, this is not a case of *flesh* but of
<br />
what it may mean for *you* to die, for instance.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Posthumanists would probably say 'yes' - and a qualitatively better one
</em><br />
than us non-cyborgs and human chess players. They seem to be somewhere
<br />
between
<br />
Kubrick's 'Hal' and Spielberg's 'David'.&gt;
<br />
<p>Again, we should not forget the differences, saying that
<br />
A is identical to B, if (and only if) we state differences
<br />
for instance concerning the *stuff* (and/or the processes)
<br />
of which cyborgs and humans are made. Obviously, if a cyborg
<br />
is *identical* to a human, then it is not a cyborg any more. The
<br />
key point here is, I think, that in order for anything to be *artificial*
<br />
there should be a difference(s) to something regarded as
<br />
(no, not as *natural) an *original*, as our colleague Negrotti
<br />
(Urbino Univ.) states. So, the *in-formation* (in the verbal sense
<br />
of the word) is no the same. I remember a nice story regarding
<br />
the question whether there is something *eatable* before *eating
<br />
beings* are there (for instance the relation between carrots and
<br />
hares). In my view it makes no sense (=no in-formation) to say
<br />
there *exists* something that can be eaten without presupposing
<br />
that this quality is meaningful if and only if we consider it with
<br />
regard to beings that eat.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I tend to agree with Jerry in questioning &quot;that &quot;information&quot; is tightly
</em><br />
coupled to
<br />
human values and utilitarian patterns of belief.&quot;
<br />
<p>not necessarily if you take in-formation in its verbal sense
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Are Liberal Humanists becoming 'human all too human' about 'embodi-ment'
</em><br />
&nbsp;'be-ing' and 'mean-ing'?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aren't we mistaken in treating such concepts as steady states rather than
</em><br />
continuous entities? Paper(as Bohm pointed out) is in its quantum potential
<br />
form 'paper-ing'. Just as language is really languag-ing and meaning is
<br />
mean-ing.*
<br />
(to paraphrase Nietzsche - 'Jedes Wort ist ein Abgrund')
<br />
Sense (Christoph's 'web of meaning') emerges out of our interaction
<br />
(being-in-the-world) with other 'beings' and with 'things' like computers,
<br />
faxes, robots et al. It is somehow embedded in the ecology of living
<br />
interaction.&gt;
<br />
<p>in this case *in-formation* has ideed another meaning for us than, say,
<br />
for the hare or the robot...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To talk about 'information' carrying or transferring meaning (or vice
</em><br />
versa)
<br />
is in my view myopic and takes into account only passive information -
<br />
incidents
<br />
and artefacts rather than that active force Jerry alludes to in his
<br />
Wordsworth quote.
<br />
This is where the technology school of Knowledge Management has gone so
<br />
horribly wrong.
<br />
N'est-ce-pas?
<br />
<p>oui, bien sur. This is why the English language does not use the
<br />
plural *informations*. We can transmit *messages* i.e. we can
<br />
make a *meaning offer* (or an in-formation offer) concerning possible
<br />
*meanings* of
<br />
what is being announced/proclaimed (which may vary in case of
<br />
two human beings, a robot and a human being, two robots,
<br />
a dog and a human being, a cell and a virus...)
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The choice is really between 'informational pattern' and 'embodied
</em><br />
enaction'
<br />
not between fleshly beings and digital 'things.' Do you agree with that?
<br />
<p>well, I would say, these are different questions/choices. The one concerns
<br />
the idea that *enbodied action* can be seen as an abstract (programmable)
<br />
informational process or as a *substance*/*process*-dependent
<br />
*in-formation* process. If we change the starting parameters (for instance
<br />
if we take silicon instead of living matter), we get different kinds of
<br />
*in-formation* (in the verbal sense). To try  to establish an identity
<br />
(for instance *flesh* = silicon) where we really make a difference is
<br />
not very logical...
<br />
<p>The other question concerns the difference between the flesh and
<br />
the digital. This is a large question. I believe that we (I mean not
<br />
primarily
<br />
scientists, but in a diffuse way also our society, although this is very
<br />
vague...) are  paradigmatic immersed into what I call a *digital ontology*.
<br />
I mean not that we consider everything to be digital (as Pythagoras
<br />
with regard to numbers as the essence of phainomena...) but that we
<br />
look at *reality* (or at what it means *be-ing*, not at what kinds of
<br />
beings there are) through the *glasses* of digitability. In other
<br />
words, we believe we *understand* (and are able to *explain*)
<br />
something when we can digitalize it and manipulate/computate it
<br />
(&quot;esse est computari&quot;, as I put it). This (in a neutral sense)
<br />
*ideo-logy* replaces good old 19th century materialism.
<br />
<p>I oppose this view to the perception of (in the Greek sense of the word)
<br />
*physis*
<br />
as what comes forth out of itself. This opposition is not of the kind
<br />
of a metaphysical dualism, as we can indeed get differents kinds
<br />
of *synergy* between both, as you state:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the debate goes to the heart of Michael Conrad's theories and
</em><br />
the belief in a synergy between natural and computational phenomena.
<br />
The jury is still out on that. &gt;
<br />
<p>indeed, but this does not evade the difference between, if I may say
<br />
it in a *stoic* terminology, what is in our power and what is not. And many
<br />
things that we create and thing they are in our power, precisely
<br />
because of the synergy you talk about, evade into *physis*. In
<br />
other words: we are part of the game, not the *webmaster* itself.
<br />
As stoics said (I am not sure where this dictum comes from), wisdom
<br />
means to know where is the difference between what in in our
<br />
power and what is not... and: to know/to learn to make this
<br />
difference.

<p>*&quot;A noun is just a &quot;slow&quot; verb; that is, it refers to a process that is
<br />
progressing so slowly as to appear static. For example, the paper on

which this text is printed appears to have a stable existence, but
<br />
we know that it is, at all times including this very moment, changing
<br />
and evolving toward dust. Hence paper would more accurately be called

papering-to emphasize that it is always and inevitably a dynamic process

undergoing perpetual change.&quot;

<br />
<p><p>I am not sure if we are thinking in the
<br />
same direction
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rafael,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You higlight a good point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Overall answer: yes the presence of water will generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a meaningful information for you and for the robot.
</em><br />
<p>well only in case the robot is of the kind of being
<br />
that can *experience* (in its own body...) thirst
<br />
(not just to have been *programmed* to *answer*
<br />
'Yes, I am thirsty' when it perceives water...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But beyond this statement, many things will be different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presence of water is the external information that you,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thirsty human, receive. And this received information will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate a meaning in your body because it has some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation with your constraint &quot;maintain a given level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water in the body&quot;. And the meaningful information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated will be &quot;presence of water that can reduce my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thirst&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the robot, assuming it has been programmed with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraint &quot;drink some water&quot;, the presence of water will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate a meaningful information &quot;presence of water that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can satisfy the constraint&quot;.
</em><br />
<p>this is the point where I do not agree: to have been
<br />
programmed is not the same as to *feel* the need
<br />
for water based on bodily constraints... (this is *just*
<br />
a formal similarity). This is the reason, I believe, why
<br />
the *top down* idea of making robots *think* (GPS and
<br />
the like) is *wrong* i.e. it will remain *forever* abstract.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the robot, like you, will generate internally a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information. At first look, theses two meaningful information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are quite similar. But this similarity is only for this precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning vs this precise constraint. For the robot, it is all that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is to be said. But for us humans, the presence of water is going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to generate many other meanings coming from the constraints
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to our history of relations with water and with the world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to our other desires, to our emotions, to our free will, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And for us, the meaning quite similar to the one generated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within the robot will be only a little element in the web of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings that the presence of water will generate within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves.
</em><br />
<p>indeed, this is just a *similarity* , here I agree again...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This makes the difference. As you write it, a human can say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;it is related to my whole bodily being-in-the-world with others.. &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could also add the other difference about derived vs non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived meaning (the meaning in the robot comes from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human programing. For us, it does not).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apart from this last difference, I feel we can say that it is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a question about a difference of complexity than about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference of nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you agree ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>yes, but the difference does not just come from the
<br />
progammer, it comes basically from the kind of being
<br />
a robot is (in case it is not a *flesh* one... at least...

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Christoph,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as far as I can see, something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has meaning for me (or for another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; kind of living system) not just if data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are *processed* in my brain but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if it is related to my whole bodily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being-in-the-world with others... I mean,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if I am thirsty it is because my body is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of this kind that it needs water. Would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it make *any difference* (i.e. any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning and therefore has any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; informational value...) if a robot that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not of the kind of bodily existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as I am, would be able to say: I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thirsty? and the same with all other

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *meanings*.
