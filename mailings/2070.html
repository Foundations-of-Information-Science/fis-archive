                    <br />
                <p>Thanks for your 'leteral' (at the quantum concurrence of the literal and the lateral?) comments.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    &lt;We are not being reductionists reducing information to joules and degrees centigrade.
                    &lt;Instead, we're thinking on what corresponds to &quot;joules&quot; and &quot;degrees
                    centigrade&quot; at the &lt;information level...
                    <br />
                <p>&lt;We naturally think in terms of metaphors and analogies. Why deny that?
                    <br />
                    &lt;Why is the crisp and dry metaphor of mathematics nonarbitrary, and the
                    <br />
                    &lt;free-flying metaphor arbitrary?
                    <br />
                <p>Yes, can't information embody both symbol and energy (energeia)?
                    <br />
                <p>Reductionism haunts this forum like Banquo's apparition at Macbeth's feast - and 'information' is the
                    free-flying Fleance whose whereabouts are unknown at the end of the play. (In cybersemiotic literary
                    criticism Macbeth himself is a Posthumanist tragically embroiled in the conflict between dynamis
                    (power) and energeia (ambition - his entropic
                    <br />
                    quest for the joules). Banquo's ghost is white noise produced by the babbling guests at the banquet
                    which itself symbolizes the temporary success of Technology &lt;:)
                    <br />
                <p>The problem is not reduction per se - a useful tool bequeathed to us by Descartes and now a
                    time-honoured method of digesting an intractable problem one bite at a time.
                    <br />
                <p>I have a real problem with the -ism at the end - the original sin of scientific thinking - or
                    imitative scient-ism. If von Foerster (and Godl) were right and science is ultimately about
                    subjective narratives then Marx could never be a Marxist, Nietzsche wouldn't be a Nietzschean and
                    Jesus Christ wasn't a Christian Scientist (or even a Christian). The noun from which 'scientist' is
                    derived is 'scientism'. Wouldn't we be better off calling ourselves 'sciencists'? In French science
                    and knowledge conflate in 'la science' and the pluralistic 'connaissances'. The English language has
                    created the unfortunate duality of 'science' and 'knowledge' and left us with the legacy of 'two
                    cultures'.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    The noble art of reduction shouldn't be confused with the contemporary trend to compartmentalise
                    science, reduce it to mechanistic explanations and dodge the
                    <br />
                    implications of complexity.
                    <br />
                <p>Sloppy terminology leads to confusion (which is the original meaning of 'war').
                    <br />
                <p>For example, any discipline which gives itself a name by pluralising an adjective must be suspect -
                    like economics, linguistics, informatics and not forgetting mathematics and physics. The spawn of
                    contemporary -ics is a legacy of that cacozelia and has itself contributed to the specialist
                    compartmentalisation of learning. At least biology, geology, medicine and law got their monikers
                    right. Alfred Korzybski might have been correct when he blamed Aristotle (anagrammatically the
                    'totaliser' of knowledge) for the 'binding' of science in its own classification systems and
                    nomenclatures. Then the Count gave us his opaque General Semantics in 'Science and Sanity' which
                    only compounded the problem.
                    <br />
                <p>Which leads us back to Stanley's call for an epistemology of 'vagueness' and the
                    simplicity/complexity dilemma. What could be more illustrative of this than the label 'quark'(why
                    not 'Snark'?)in subatomic physics with the crisp and dry attributes 'truth''beauty' etc?

                <p>I can't agree with you Pedro in excluding energy from our notions of economy or information.
                    <br />
                    Few if any of the other 50 million species on this planet have developed symbols metaphors
                    <br />
                    or natural language but most partake of informational exchange. We cannot survive on imagery (or
                    software) alone. What we need is broader non-energeticist notions of 'energeia' and 'dynamis' which
                    includes and transcends entropy - the phenomenology of Bob's 'underlying networks of material and
                    energy flows'.

                <p>A plant is paying the bee with sugar to disperse the pollen. A potato is

                    paying humans with carbohydrates to disperse the plant. A cherry tree

                    pays the bee first for doing the matchmaking, and the bird later for

                    smell and look good so that the bees don't need to think that much to
                    <br />
                    find them (how strange that we like what the bees like?). When I go for
                    <br />
                    a walk around the bushes, I am saddened to see the prickly dog rose
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    (they prefer sunflower seeds). Food is money: ATP is cash, glucose is
                    <br />
                    bonds, fat is property.
                    <br />
                <p>As a human, I don't feel that our monetary economics is *that*
                    <br />
                    special... It just operates on a higher level, but there is nothing
                    <br />
                    conceptually different, if you allow for the inter-level
                    <br />
                    self-similarity. The message of entropy and energy is that essentially
                    <br />
                    the same descriptors can be applied to any level. We are not being
                    <br />
                    reductionists reducing information to joules and degrees centigrade.
                    <br />
                    Instead, we're thinking on what corresponds to &quot;joules&quot; and &quot;degrees
                    <br />
                    centigrade&quot; at the information level.
                    <br />
                <p>When you spend energy, you pay. When you obtain energy, you are paid. We
                    <br />
                    are all paid here by the Sun to do something. We, humans, are paid to
                    <br />
                    maintain an ecosystem of symbols and thoughts, not to generate entropy.
                    <br />
                    Anyone who's talking here is selling ideas, and those who are listening
                    <br />
                    are buying them. As long as there are sellers and buyers and profit for
                    <br />
                    both, the forum exists.
                    <br />
                <p>There is a distinct tendency for ideas to disperse. Eventually, each of
                    <br />
                    us might know everything. There will no longer be a gradient, and there
                    <br />
                    will no longer be trade. That's when the entropy will win, and that's
                    <br />
                    when it will be the death of the forum.
                    <br />
                <p>Both selling and buying of ideas, even listening to them involves
                    <br />
                    spending energy at the lower level (our breakfasts). When there will no
                    <br />
                    longer be bread that can be used for thinking, the ideas and the medium
                    <br />
                    in which they dwell (us), both of them will be gone.

                <p>The ideas can consume their owners (suicide cults, self-sacrifice,
                    <br />
                    workaholism, university education), and the ideas can make their owners
                    <br />
                    multiply (Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; pragmatically mistreated by social disciplines). How could one run a

                <p>Let me try: Computation is a set of constraints you place on the flow of
                    <br />
                    energy. Some computations reinforce the flow in an autocatalytic fashion
                    <br />
                    (software you want to buy; the software that thus gets reproduced, like
                    <br />
                    we let good potatoes reproduce), others just produce entropy (&quot;10 goto
                    <br />
                    10&quot; that makes your computer suck electricity and pump hot air out from
                    <br />
                    itself). Viruses and worms are selfish autocatalytic loops, and we pay
                    <br />
                    for antivirus software to get rid of them, just like we have to pay for
                    <br />
                    the immune systems in our bodies. Operating systems are
                    <br />
                    centrally-managed artificial ecosystems that maintain order and allocate
                    <br />
                    resources. Etc.
                    <br />
