<p>
This will be my second (and therefore final) post to FIS of this week.
<br />
I'll reply to Jerry's comments. By the way, my name is Edwina not
<br />
Edwinia. (minor point but scientific attention to details does
<br />
matter).
<br />
<p><p><p>Jerry said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is category theory a tetradic framework?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A category operates, at a *minimum*, on four objects (domains and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; codomains) and three morphisms linking them to one another. Roughly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaking, a category operates concomitantly on three dyadic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frameworks, two triadic frameworks and one tetradic framework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *IF* one chose to define Pierce's &quot;firstness&quot;, &quot;secondness&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;thirdness&quot; as morphisms ,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *then* one could (possibly) construct a correspondence relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the semantics of firstness, secondness and thirdness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *and* the nature of the morphisms of a category.
</em><br />
<p>Again, I disagree with the above images. First-  you still have only
<br />
two 'realities':  objects and morphisms linking the objects. That's
<br />
dyadic.
<br />
Second, what do you mean by a 'correspondenc relation between Peirce's
<br />
Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness Relations and category morphisms?
<br />
Remember, these Peircean actions are Relations and are each completely
<br />
different from the other. They can't be reduced to each other, and you
<br />
can't have a robust semiosic process without all three relations. And
<br />
these are Relations, not morphic categories.
<br />
<p>Jerry said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, at issue is the nature of the four objects as related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the three morphisms. A precise logical relation within a category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists between the four objects and the three morphisms such that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic coherence is generated among the four objects and three
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; morphisms. (For an introductory text on categories, see the book by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lawvere, Conceptual Mathematics.)
</em><br />
<p>I have the same concern: objects and morphisms. That's a dyad, no
<br />
matter how many objects and how many morphisms.
<br />
<p>Jerry said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, in certain cases, the objects of a category can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical propositions.
</em><br />
<p>I have no problem with an object being a proposition. After all,
<br />
semiotics is essentially a logical process.
<br />
<p>Jerry said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In another example, I have recently succeeded in developing a model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of chemical species directly from the metaphysical primitives of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, identity, space and time.  Thus it became possible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct an organic theory of communication based on an organic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; species as a mathematical species as alluded to within my abstract.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This allows one to contrast it with the Shannon engineering approach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which is purely a formal syntactical structure without meaning).
</em><br />
<p>I am presuming that these four: matter, identity, space and time are
<br />
NOT your four objects as stated above. I don't see how you can
<br />
separate them. I don't see that matter can exist without identity, and
<br />
that includes spatial and temporal paremeters.  The point to the
<br />
Shannon approach is that it specifically tries to prevent the 'given
<br />
matter' from having any further relations. I think that that given
<br />
matter (the bit that is being transported) does have meaning - but
<br />
it's a frozen meaning that is not allowed to change.
<br />
<p>Jerry:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tensions between the concepts of semiotics, semantics and syntax are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to  the question of structure and the relations among such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures.
</em><br />
<p>I think these terms: semiotics, semantics and syntax have little
<br />
relevance to each other and are hang-ons from the old period when
<br />
semiotics referred to literature and language. I think these terms
<br />
muddy things up now. A genuine semiotics must operate within a
<br />
'structure' (in literature/language, structure is called a syntax).
<br />
This structure is Thirdness, the normative habits. A genuine semiotics
<br />
must also generate meaning, ie, it must process energy/matter such
<br />
that this energy/matter can enter into relations with other
<br />
energy/matter. As such, this energy/matter is 'informed'; it is an
<br />
interpretant; it is information. The linguistic term  for
<br />
interpretation or meaning is 'semantics'.  So, the fact that you use
<br />
these three terms and separate them - semiotics, semantics
<br />
(interpretant) and syntax (normative habits).  ...Well,  I think that
<br />
these three terms ignore that semiotics IS a triadic process that
<br />
operates within a logical habitus (its 'structure', its syntax) and a
<br />
process of interpretation (its semantics). So- I simply don't see what
<br />
your use of the term 'semiotics'....separated from normative habits
<br />
and interpretation...ends up meaning.
<br />
<p>Jerry said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Within category theory, one has substantial &quot;logical space&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; associate semiotic concepts with semantic concepts and with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntactical concepts.  The above example illustrates an approach to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolving the tensions between semiotics and mathematical syntax in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of associated structures of a category.
</em><br />
<p>And that's exactly what I am talking about. I don't know what
<br />
semiotics means to you, Jerry, but the fact that you set it up as a
<br />
single term used along with the two other terms of semantics and
<br />
syntax means that its meaning has absolutely nothing to do with the
<br />
semiotics that I use. And I'm not a 'rogue' semiotician. The semiotic
<br />
process is triadic; it must develop a set of normative habits (again,
<br />
in language- called a syntax); to process the input-energy and
<br />
transform it to an interpretant (in linguistic terms, 'semantics').
<br />
The continued use of linguistic terms with semiotic terms ...simply
<br />
confuses everything.
<br />
<p>Jerry said:
<br />
<p>Let me close with a note of caution.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Category theory is a theory of mathematics.  Application of category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory to scientific questions is a very challenging undertaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of its abstractness and the complex origin of its coherence.
</em><br />
<p>I
<br />
ll second the note of caution. But- I'll say that semiosic theory is a
<br />
logical process and its application to science is challenging - but -
<br />
as you might see from the papers published using semiotics as applied
<br />
to science - it is highly productive.
<br />
<p>That's it for the week. And I'm away next week.
