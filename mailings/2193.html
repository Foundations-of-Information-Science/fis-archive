Dear John, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Your  feeling of going around in circles is almost always an effect of not
<br />
listening. (&quot;Grumpy, grumpy&quot;). I understand that you want us to read more
<br />
of your previous oeuvre. (I read some of it, but not all.) 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Let me begin by quoting you from the previous email:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;For one thing, complete formalization of meaning kills meaning. Meaning
<br />
must be open-ended and fallible.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
First, I am not sure that meaning is a living thing that can be killed. I
<br />
would like to distinguish analytically between the embodiment of meaning
<br />
and the meaning-processing in cultural processes. That is why I claimed in
<br />
the previous email that social systems contain one more degree of freedom.
<br />
I suppose that we agree that meaning can be considered as an attribute of
<br />
the communication. Meaning is generated by exchanging information on top of
<br />
the information exchange process. This can first be done by the
<br />
communicating systems which provide meaning to the information, but in
<br />
social systems one is additionally able to communicate meaning. It
<br />
generates a next layer of possible exchanges. In biological systems,
<br />
meaning can only be developed along a life-cycle. A social system, however,
<br />
contains a non-linear dynamics of processing situational meanings. This is
<br />
what I mean with an additional degree of freedom.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
For example, some meanings can be codified in a scientific discourse and
<br />
others are not. Thus, in addition to stabilization of a meaning like in a
<br />
niche of communication, meanings can also be globalized. I suppose that you
<br />
mean this reference to a horizon of meaning with &quot;open-ended and fallible.&quot;
<br />
The system of reference, however, is different in social systems from
<br />
biological ones. In the latter the system of reference for the &quot;open-
<br />
endedness&quot; is a given system, while in social systems this selection
<br />
environment of possible meaning is also generated by the exchanges as a
<br />
system of expectations.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Most of the authors you cite are generalizing (or not) on the basis of
<br />
biological systems theory. This was also at the center of the exchange
<br />
between Sven and me: what is the differentia specifica of a social system?
<br />
It seems to me that this is to be found in the way how meaning is processed
<br />
differently from the processing of meaning in biological and psychological
<br />
systems. At the psychological level, meaning is still coupled
<br />
(structurally?) to the biological environment. In the social exchange of
<br />
meaning a bifurcation between the production of meaning and the diffusion
<br />
of meaning seems possible.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<p><p>Dear Loet,
<br />
<p>I understand your concerns but how else are we to proceed?  Shannon's model
<br />
is not nullified but it does not appear to characterize all that we would
<br />
wish it to.  I am not asking for a full rewrite I am simply observing that
<br />
we need to extend information theory into the area where we lack rigor -
<br />
where the model seemingly needs to be extended.  I am simply contending
<br />
that we cannot deal with the notion of information in isolation.
<br />
<p>In my view we need to develop two new models that complement current
<br />
physical theory with the mathematical rigor of Shannon: a theory of
<br />
organism (how sentient entities come to be) and a theory of semeiotics (how
<br />
sentient entities operate) - where semeiotics includes a theory of
<br />
communication and what I will call &quot;memeiosis&quot; which describes the exchange
<br />
of &quot;information&quot; and the development of concepts by individuals in groups
<br />
of sentient entities.  Done rigorously, this is inevitably a mathematical
<br />
theory of meaning as you suggest.
<br />
<p><p>For reasons why I doubt that a mathematical theory of meaning is
<br />
impossible, see Pragmatist Pragmatics: The functional context of
<br />
utterances, forthcoming in Philosophica. Konrad Talmont-Kaminski and I
<br />
argue that a formal pragmatics is impossible, and that a theory of meaning
<br />
requires pragmatics, therefore a formal theory of meaning is impossible.
<br />
However once we have the meaning of a communication fixed, we can then use
<br />
formal methods that are well known. The argument uses Barwise and
<br />
Seligman's version of information flow, and draws on work in formal
<br />
pragmatics by Montague, Kaplan and Stalnaker, situation semantics of
<br />
Barwise and Perry, and insights from Peirce. There is a draft version at
<br />
<a href="../../www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/pragmatist%20pragmatics.pdf">http://www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/pragmatist%20pragmatics.pdf</a> 
<br />
<p><p><p>As to &quot;expected information can only be provided with meaning by
<br />
information systems&quot;; I think this is problematic without a clear
<br />
definition of what you mean by &quot;information systems.&quot;  From my point of
<br />
view computational models do not adequately account for sentience.
<br />
<p><p>Nor for living systems in general if Robert Rosen's arguments in Life
<br />
Itself are correct. He shows rigorously how a system can fail to be
<br />
computable or mechanical in the sense of a terminating (Knuth) algorithm.
<br />
Henri Atlan has made similar arguments, to the effect that certain
<br />
molecular systems on which living systems depend have infinite
<br />
&quot;sophistication&quot;, which I take to be equivalent to Bennett's logical depth.
<br />
<p>Interestingly, there is a review article from Science on the early stages
<br />
of sea urchin development that claims that there are emergent properties of
<br />
the developmental system (not reducible to the parts of the regulatory
<br />
network) at early stages. I have not been able to evaluate this claim
<br />
myself. The article is A Genomic Regulatory Network for Development

<p>Development of the body plan is controlled by large networks of regulatory

genes. A gene regulatory network that controls the speci¨­cation of
<br />
endoderm and mesoderm in the sea urchin embryo is summarized here.
<br />
The network was derived from large-scale perturbation analyses, in
<br />
combination
<br />
with computational methodologies, genomic data, cis-regulatory
<br />
analysis, and molecular embryology. The network contains over 40 genes
<br />
at present, and each node can be directly verified at the DNA sequence
<br />
level by cis-regulatory analysis. Its architecture reveals specific and
<br />
general
<br />
aspects of development, such as how given cells generate their
<br />
ordained fates in the embryo and why the process moves inexorably
<br />
forward in developmental time.

<p><p>Dear Steven,

<br />
I agree that there are obviously two usages of the word information: a
<br />
group of definitions akin to Shannon's mathematical definition and a group
<br />
of definitions which define information as &quot;what in-forms&quot; a system
<br />
(Varela). In the latter case, the system invests some meaning in the
<br />
information or, more generally, positions the information in its framework.
<br />
Perhaps, one could use the word &quot;observed information&quot; for this, while the
<br />
Shannon-information remains &quot;expected information.&quot;
<br />
<p><p>Again, for an explanation of how these two ideas can be brought together

<br />
<p><p><p><p>What I like best about Shannon's approach is the mathematical character
<br />
which frees us from specific semantics. When I read your mailings, for
<br />
example, it seems that I have to buy a whole philosophy if I wish to
<br />
understand it. From my perspective, this philosophy sounds like a meta-
<br />
biology (unlike a meta-physics). Biological systems theory has helped us
<br />
enormously in understanding how information can be stored into information
<br />
systems and thus provided with meaning (by codification along the system's
<br />
own axis). Social and psychic systems, however, can entertain (and perhaps
<br />
communicate) horizons of meaning. Thus, they obviously have more degrees of
<br />
freedom for processing information and meaning than biological systems
<br />
(while the latter are also embodied?). 
<br />
<p><p>I am not at all sure that the latter have more degrees of freedom. The
<br />
difference seems to me to be much more in terms of response time and extent
<br />
(thought is faster than evolution, culture expands spatial extent, as does
<br />
communication in general). A number of distinctions need to be made to sort
<br />
this out, but Cliff Hooker and I made them in &quot;Complexly Organised
<br />
Dynamical Systems&quot;, Open Systems and Information Dynamics, 6 (1999): 241-
<br />
302. There is a copy available at

<br />

meaning, see my Autonomy in Anticipatory Systems: Significance for

<p><p><p>It seems to me that we need a kind of mathematical theory of meaning. How
<br />
can meaning be defined in the abstract, yet without giving it meaning with
<br />
reference to any body of knowledge other than the abstract one which is
<br />
contained, for example, in the mathematical theory of communication and its
<br />
elaboration into non-linear dynamics? Let me make a first proposal:
<br />
expected information can only be provided with meaning by information
<br />
systems. I know that this circular definition begs the question, but it is
<br />
only meant as a first step. 
<br />
<p><p>It is certainly not sufficient without being really question begging.  For
<br />
one thing, complete formalization of meaning kills meaning. Meaning must be
<br />
open-ended and fallible. For the argument for this see my THE DYNAMICAL
<br />
BASIS OF INFORMATION AND THE ORIGINS OF SEMIOSIS, in Edwina Taborsky (ed)
<br />
Semiosis. Evolution. Energy Towards a Reconceptualization of the Sign.
<br />
Aachen Shaker Verlag 1999 Bochum Publications in Semiotics New Series. Vol.
<br />
3 (1999): 111-136. It can be found at
<br />
<a href="../../www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/Dyninf3.pdf">http://www.nu.ac.za/undphil/collier/papers/Dyninf3.pdf</a>. The argument is
<br />
basically Peircean, but with more modern formalism. If you understand
<br />
semiotics, then you understand why a formal and complete theory of meaning
<br />
is impossible. It is possible, however, to link up a formal but incomplete
<br />
theory of information with a theory of meaning.
<br />
<p>Sorry to harp here, but I keep feeling that we are going around in circles,
<br />
repeating again and again issues that have either been solved or else have
<br />
been shown to have no formal and complete solution. I mention my own papers
<br />
mostly because I have taken a lot of trouble to review these issues.
<br />
Everyone on the fis list should read Heinz von Foerster's 1960 paper 'On
<br />
self-organizing systems and their environments'. There is a reprint in his
<br />
collection Understanding Understanding. Forty five years later we shouldn't
<br />
still be inventing the wheel this group seems to be spinning around on.
