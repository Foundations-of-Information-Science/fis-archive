                    Replying to Igor (and footnotes to John H and John C)
                    <br />
                <p>I will attempt to reply to Igor's interesting posting, where he
                    <br />
                    distinguishes strongly between self-organization, SOC, and autocatalytic
                    <br />
                    systems, all of which, it seems to me could nevertheless be aspects of any
                    <br />
                    natural system. So, my view is not to suggest that these different ideas
                    <br />
                    are related, but that they may all be modeling different aspects of some
                    <br />
                    complex dynamic material system, which, in addition, would necessarily --
                    <br />
                    if located somewhere -- be regulated by environmental conditions.
                    <br />
                    Any natural dynamical system self-organizes, but only under the tutelage of
                    <br />
                    current boundary conditions (some of which may be recursive upon the
                    <br />
                    actions of the system). And some of these would be like the externalties of
                    <br />
                    classical economics. As well, some of these, it seems to me, would be
                    <br />
                    formally like the 'tunings' of economic systems, even though the latter
                    <br />
                    have been influenced by human projects and would emerge from within a
                    <br />
                    system. As for being &quot;externally driven&quot;, such systems often/?always would
                    <br />
                    come into being as a result of environmental forcings.
                    <br />
                    Self-organizing natural systems would undergo development, and would not
                    <br />
                    become &quot;steady state&quot; until they reached that stage (I call it maturity) in
                    <br />
                    their development. SOC is observed when systems designed to show it reach
                    <br />
                    (if they do) steady state, ignoring the development of the system up until
                    <br />
                    that time (which is often very rapid in the simple systems usually
                    <br />
                    examined). In some natural cases that development could have autocatalytic
                    <br />
                    properties, which would be more likely to become salient in more
                    <br />
                    complicated systems.
                    <br />
                    So, I guess my point is that all of these ideas could be applied to a
                    <br />
                    single system. As in SOC, the system could be initited by some external
                    <br />
                    forcing (efficient cause). After being initiated, it might self-organize
                    <br />
                    (based on material causes), and, if it has some duration and complication,
                    <br />
                    autocatalysis (a formal cause) could feature in its development, as well as
                    <br />
                    some kind of process of internal tuning via feedbacks on recursive
                    <br />
                    constraints if the system is complicated enough. Is a syncretic picture
                    <br />
                    like this not reasonable?
                    <br />
