Dear Soren, Rafeal, Loet and Others:
<br />
<p>One of the central issues of communication is the role of 
<br />
mathematical or symbolic representations as carriers of information 
<br />
among individuals.
<br />
<p>Shannon information theory presupposes that mathematical symbols are 
<br />
sufficient for transfer of encoded information between machines in 
<br />
the present of noise.  FIS readers are probably unanimous in their 
<br />
admiration of the remarkable success of this theory and the wonderful 
<br />
benefits we have derived from it.
<br />
<p>Of special concern to FIS is the issue of extensibility of the 
<br />
concept of information from machines to other (organic) systems.   In 
<br />
this post, I seek to address these and related issues from the 
<br />
perspective of organicism.
<br />
<p>If the extension of the concept of information was merely a matter of 
<br />
mathematics, then one would expect that a suitable mathematical 
<br />
theory of chemical communication or cellular communication or 
<br />
biological communication or human communication would be invented. 
<br />
(Tom Schneider's work is a novel step in this direction.)  The 
<br />
richness of the mechanical tool set of mathematics is nearly 
<br />
unimaginable.  The number of mathematical theories available is huge 
<br />
- set theory, hyperset theory, semi-groups, groups, rings of various 
<br />
sorts, fields, vector spaces, graphs (various sorts) topolgies, 
<br />
(virtually endless number of types,) matroids, categories, 
<br />
N-categories, and so forth.  Analogously, the number of 
<br />
mathematicians and engineers (and industrial organizations) 
<br />
interested in communication is also huge.  Why is a satisfactory 
<br />
theory of organic communication lacking?
<br />
<p>One approach to generating a general theory of communication is to 
<br />
break the problem into levels or degrees of organization, simpler 
<br />
systems of communication among simpler objects and more perplex 
<br />
systems of communication among more perplex objects. (Perplex is used 
<br />
in the sense of &quot;repeated enfoldings of structures.&quot;)
<br />
<p>I wish to contrast two philosophies of communication theories 
<br />
relevant to the question of &quot;levels&quot; or &quot;hierarchies&quot; or &quot;degrees of 
<br />
organization&quot;.
<br />
<p>One philosophy is represented by Loet.  This philosophy presupposes 
<br />
that mathematical terms and terminology can be transubstantiated. 
<br />
That is, given a discourse among generalized &quot;objects&quot;,(molecules, 
<br />
cells, humans, social groups, etc), the mathematical terminology can 
<br />
be directly applied to the discourse.  For example, Loet wrote of 
<br />
&quot;orthogonality&quot; in the time domain of economic thinking and of 
<br />
orthogonality among the sciences.  This sort of language hides behind 
<br />
the reputation of mathematics and mechanical thinking.  This 
<br />
mechanical reasoning is consistent with an engineering perspective 
<br />
and well grounded in traditional scientific concepts.  But, the 
<br />
transubstantiation of matter into mathematical symbols lies at the 
<br />
heart of transferring the logic of the discourse from the chemical 
<br />
(biological) system to mathematical symbols.    After more than two 
<br />
decades of efforts, I can NOT identify the mechanical processes in 
<br />
living systems that are consistent with  the theories of mathematics 
<br />
that I am aware of.  Of course, my lack of success is nothing more 
<br />
than a failure to identify such a system. Nevertheless, I am 
<br />
extremely skeptical that such a system exists.  My skepticism is 
<br />
firmly grounded on profound distinction between chemical atoms and 
<br />
logical atoms.
<br />
<p>The second philosophy of communication theories emerges from medicine 
<br />
and the practise of medical therapies.  This philosophy is grounded 
<br />
in organicism. The medical philosophy of organicism holds that 
<br />
diseases are organic in nature.  Failures of health result from 
<br />
failures in organic functions of organs and organ systems.  The 
<br />
corollary to this presupposition is that if normal organ function can 
<br />
be restored, then &quot;health&quot; will be restored. (Alternatively, removal 
<br />
of the malfunctioning organ may also solve the problem.)  This 
<br />
philosophy of medicine has had some successes.  This philosophy is 
<br />
grounded in the transmutive nature of matter, not the 
<br />
transubstantiation of matter into symbols.
<br />
<p>Communication's terminology is widely used in discussions of 
<br />
organicism.  We speak of messengers, second messengers, messenger 
<br />
RNA, codes, etc.  The philosophy of organicism is not derived from 
<br />
mechanical operations on mathematical symbols, rather it emerges from 
<br />
both clinical and biological experimentation.  Although a number of 
<br />
symbol systems are employed within modern organicism, the primary 
<br />
basis of organicism symbols are chemical symbols.  The rigid 
<br />
structures and corresponding exact predictive powers of groups, 
<br />
rings, vector spaces and so forth are NOT at the logical roots of the 
<br />
philosophy of organicism.
<br />
<p>Now, we come to a crucial question:
<br />
<p>When we construct more perplex objects from less perplex objects, 
<br />
that is, we adopt a language of &quot;levels&quot;, which of these two 
<br />
philosophies do we invoke?
<br />
<p>In my own work, I explicitly state that I am defining (limiting, 
<br />
bounding) my remarks to &quot;degrees of organization&quot;.  This terminology 
<br />
is used because I seek to allude to the concepts of organicism in my 
<br />
approach to analysis of communication and its role in health and 
<br />
disease.
<br />
<p>Because organicism is grounded in chemical symbols, the primary 
<br />
correspondence relations are with structures -- chemical structures, 
<br />
cellular structures, organ structures, and so forth.  The 
<br />
symbolization of such structures is a code, but it is radically 
<br />
different code than that from a mathematical or mechanical code.  The 
<br />
nature of the ground set of chemical symbols is static.  If one 
<br />
wishes to introduce time and space, these concepts must be introduced 
<br />
separately.  (This separation of meanings of symbols into different 
<br />
classes should be contrasted with quantum theory where matter, time, 
<br />
space and identity are confounded into intertwined gemisch.)
<br />
<p>Clearly, Loet rejects organicism in his remarks about 
<br />
&quot;orthogonality&quot;.  How can one move from Loet's view of 
<br />
&quot;orthogonality&quot; to the structures and codes of life?  The task of 
<br />
relating organic terms to the codes and structures of life is being 
<br />
approached in several different sciences without invoking concepts 
<br />
from liner algebra.
<br />
<p>Some weeks ago, I posted a FIS message on the role of the roots of 
<br />
words in communication.  I pointed out that families of words, words 
<br />
all derived from the same root, bear a logical resemblance to one 
<br />
another.  This quality of resemblance is extremely useful in 
<br />
describing organicism.  As a method of communication, the &quot;family of 
<br />
a root&quot; provides a basis for logical extension from less perplex 
<br />
objects to more perplex objects  WITHOUT INVOKING MECHANICAL 
<br />
(MATHEMATICAL) symbols.  The method allows one to use numbers without 
<br />
invoking the machinery of mathematical functions.  The method allows 
<br />
one to speak of relations without invoking a rigid mathematical 
<br />
structure that denies the  individuality of each cell, each organ and 
<br />
each individual.  The method allows one to develop syllogisms for 
<br />
enumeration of organic structures.
<br />
<p>Loet rejected this approach, offering a counter example with another 
<br />
word, nature.  Loet's counterexample misses the point entirely.  One 
<br />
is seeking to construct commutative diagrams among terms from 
<br />
different disciplines. Only a small fraction of the natural language 
<br />
words will be defined rigorous in multiple disciplines.  If the word 
<br />
roots can not be used to construct a commutative diagram that spans 
<br />
disciplines, then I would suggest that the &quot;family of a root&quot; not be 
<br />
used for such purposes.  For example, the family of the root, &quot;organ&quot; 
<br />
includes a wide range of terms in chemistry and medicine.  (But, the 
<br />
only derivative of &quot;organicus, organikos&quot; used in mathematics is 
<br />
limited to &quot;organization&quot; and I am not aware of a formal mathematical 
<br />
definition for this term.)
<br />
<p>Soren:  I agree with the concept that human communication is a much 
<br />
larger and more important issue than machine communication. But, I 
<br />
think we differ on what will be the basis of the development of a 
<br />
theory of human communication.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;How long will it require for traditional philosophy to come to grips 
<br />
with the chemical concept of &quot;matter&quot; as the foundational units of 
<br />
human sensory systems and human experience?
<br />
<p>I remain astounded that philosophical acceptance of 
<br />
transubstantiation of matter into (mathematical) symbols without 
<br />
recognition of the premier role of transmutation of matter in human 
<br />
growth and development and the emergence of human mentality.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, the question can poised in another manner: On what grounds can 
<br />
mathematical symbols be claimed to be superior to chemical symbols 
<br />
for the purpose of representation of matter?
<br />
<p>I suspect that a new &quot;mathematics&quot; will be necessary to represent the 
<br />
chemical and biological sciences - a system of logic that allows the 
<br />
expression of flexible relationships which we observe in organic 
<br />
systems.  Such a system of logic, to be useful, would require a 
<br />
systematic usage of commutative diagrams over &quot;families of roots&quot; in 
<br />
order to generate coherent relations over natural &quot;degrees of 
<br />
organization&quot;.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;plot of thermodynamics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It can be suggested, that at each &quot;layer of abstraction&quot; cognition

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occurs by accomplishing the following tasks: (1) identification of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;integration of the previous layer as &quot;an aspect&quot; of the given layer, (3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contribution to the construction of a next layer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Accordingly, information science may deal with following tasks:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. identify properties of information and &quot;laws&quot; of natural information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. integrate thermodynamic aspect of information processes as a part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If there cannot be an &quot;informational&quot; concept of meaning, then one has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to admit that semiotics builds up a new layer of cognition, to which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information science can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contribute, but which it is unable to explain fully.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my opinion, we are faced with following questions, based on what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outlined:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. is there a possibility for a concept that integrates meaning into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information perspective, or is meaning a concept of a &quot;new layer of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cognition&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. similarly, is language a &quot;layer of cognition&quot; that cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;described and comprehended within the information / semiotics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective? (assuming that you speak of natural languages in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;society, and not &quot;language as a code&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we accept a point of view that there are information processes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be attributed only to living systems, and those attributed only to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social systems, then these somehow are distinct. A universal information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory that is suitable for both molecular reactions and social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interactions by no means is capable to capture perks of the latter - it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can only capture commonalties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;---------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We still have not discussed what the impact is for a science of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information of having to accept level theory. In my opinion it destroys

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the idea of information science and forces us into a much bigger
