<p>
Hi folks,
<br />
<p>Jerry has given me a well-circumscribed task. Thank you for the opportunity
<br />
to discuss modeling of theoretical chemistry as a stochastical process.
<br />
<p>The task is (here comes what Jerry wrote):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Karl, my favorite molecule is known as NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine
</em><br />
Dinucleotide).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It structural formula is H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).  Six of the 21
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carbon atoms are optically active.  The NAD molecule includes five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;covalent rings, three aromatic and two aliphatic.  (See an elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biochemistry textbook for the exact structure.)
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Karl, can you demonstrate how your approach would generate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular biological isomer of NAD that is common to all living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organisms?
</em><br />
<p>The answer is:
<br />
We return to my last communication in this matter:
<br />
What comes out of the deeper investigation of mathematical objects
<br />
that are parts of a set (that gets partitioned according to stochastic
<br />
principles) is, that there appear KINDS or TYPES or ARCHETYPES of (clusters
<br />
of) objects. These can be compared to the physical and chemical objects that
<br />
the natural scientists refer to when they speak of &quot;entries in the periodic
<br />
table of elements&quot;.
<br />
You take a sufficiently big set (somewhere between 32 and 97, for some
<br />
obscure number theoretical reasons), make subsets on it and will see that
<br />
there appear kinds, types or archetypes of objects that are definitely
<br />
present. You cannot avoid meeting these.
<br />
<p>If you understand sociology and market research, you will understand the
<br />
following:
<br />
in any city, in any culture, in any field research, if you ask more than a
<br />
few dozen people, you will have types of answer collections. There will be
<br />
some &quot;really average&quot;, &quot;rather average&quot; and &quot;slightly off-stream&quot; and
<br />
&quot;eccentric&quot; types, characters, kinds or archetypes.
<br />
If you understand this, you have understood the periodic table of elements
<br />
as truth values of a multidimensional partition table of a sufficiently big
<br />
set.
<br />
<p>Jerry, you have to visualise the periodic table of elements as a truth
<br />
table. (So far, a truth table has been taught at Computers I for freshmen
<br />
with following essence:
<br />
&quot;
<br />
(1) there are 2 constants: .t. and .f..
<br />
(2) combinations of logical sentences build up a truth table
<br />
(3) Sentence A .t. .AND. sentence B .t.: A .and. B = .t. ; A .or. B = .t.
<br />
(4) Sentence A .f. .AND. sentence B .t.: A .and. B = .f. ; A .or. B = .t.
<br />
(5) Sentence A .f. .AND. sentence B .f.: A .and. B = .f. ; A .or. B = .f.&quot;
<br />
<p>Please look up the current way of putting this. A truth table describes the
<br />
logical truth of some combinations of logical sentences.
<br />
<p>Now the invention:
<br />
The undersigned (that is me, Karl Imre Javorszky) has extended the concept
<br />
of a truth table to include more dimensional combinations of logical
<br />
sentences. There are not only 2 possibilities for a logical value to be
<br />
somehow, but more. The idea is to use the .t. and .f. values to denote the
<br />
&quot;is included in a subset of size ....&quot; logical fact. This leaves you in a
<br />
fashion with the same old .t. and .f. values, but there are more of these
<br />
and they are at the second look not all exactly the same worth.
<br />
<p>The undersigned has introduced the concept of multidimensional truth tables
<br />
by using statistical, stochastical methods that are taught at Marketing,
<br />
Economics, Statistics, Sales, Sociology, Social research and the other
<br />
faculties, but also for freshmen. I hope that a professor for theoretical
<br />
chemistry can apply methods of Marketing I.
<br />
<p>In Marketing I one learns to segment the market. The market is viewed as
<br />
segmented for people who sell. They know that they don't target the whole
<br />
market but a segment of it. They say &quot;segment&quot; and what they mean is
<br />
&quot;subset&quot;. It is called correctly a subset but one does not always use the
<br />
correct name for it.
<br />
<p>So they segment the market - in their words. If they would want to talk
<br />
about what they do with mathematicians, they would say that they partition a
<br />
set. They do the same but don't say it in the same fashion. They partition a
<br />
set.
<br />
If they want to sell to middle-aged, divorced women or to self-employed
<br />
professionals in small towns, they generate multidimensional partitions.
<br />
They just don't say so, because it is a complicated business and
<br />
mathematicians like to wait up until it is clear they really have to work a
<br />
bit.
<br />
<p>We agree that marketing does use multidimensional partitions. (Ask a dealer
<br />
in e-mail addresses whether he can subsegment the set into mutually
<br />
exclusive subsets and generate overlaps according to your wishes.)
<br />
<p>Now the BIG INVENTION: (so far there was no real invention, just looking up
<br />
what other people do.)
<br />
If the set is big enough, there shall be always such a segment (subset) that
<br />
is the most probable.
<br />
<p>Meditate on this and you shall have great rewards.
<br />
<p>Your concrete question translates into marketing-speak as follows:
<br />
H(27)C(21)N(7)O(14)P(2).  Six of the 21
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carbon atoms are optically active.
</em><br />
<p>Give me the well-and-classical archetypical inhabitant of the market: he/she
<br />
comes in two varieties (he/she), equipped with 14 credit cards, has 7 living
<br />
relatives, meets weekly 21 other persons and spends money on 27 differing
<br />
occassions in the period. Six of the spending social interactions happen
<br />
with cash.
<br />
<p>This being the most common member of the market, this lemming shall be the
<br />
most easily observable unit. Why, computer artists will draw you the traffic
<br />
simulation based on the most probable behaviour of the most probable
<br />
inhabitant. Why they can't (or won't, because the definitely could) do this
<br />
for a more abstract inhabitant, I don't know. (Saying: now show me the most
<br />
probable social group size for the most probable inhabitant during the most
<br />
probable period of time, while you let the city grow in size.) But this is a
<br />
psychological question of why people don't find the answer if they are paid
<br />
for looking everywhere for that elusive answer. Would you research yourself
<br />
out of your job?
<br />
<p>Ask your friendly neighbourhood mathematician what must happen until someone
<br />
shall define the term multidimensional partition. Everyone uses them but the
<br />
mathematicians. &quot;Not defined&quot; - it is like in socialism used to be: &quot;not in
<br />
the party rules&quot;, therefore it does not exist.
<br />
<p>Hope to have helped you a bit.
<br />
Cheers
<br />
Karl
