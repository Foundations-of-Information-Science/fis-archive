                <p>
                    Dear colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>Unfortunately the end of this session on consilience is close. Around this
                    <br />
                    weekend Malcolm will post his final comments on the philosophical
                    <br />
                    whereabouts of this fascinating concept...
                    <br />
                <p>The recent comments by Stan, John, and Bob add to the complex mosaic ---I
                    <br />
                    wonder whether the reflection on the cloud ascend/descend existing
                    <br />
                    asymmetry could contribute to clarify the panorama and unite some different
                    <br />
                    strands. At least, I would like to write down a few ideas that just reflect
                    <br />
                    my own fooliness around.
                    <br />
                <p>About &quot;ascend&quot; first. What is the driving force for it? No doubt it is
                    <br />
                    largely the creation, the imagination, the inspiration of the individual
                    <br />
                    scientist. The social-communal networking may introduce further checkings,
                    <br />
                    experiments, teams, discussions, etc., and then the crucial &quot;validation&quot;
                    <br />
                    aspect that any serious scientific journal or publisher will demand before
                    <br />
                    adding it to the existing Galaxy. In spite of the vast mechanization of
                    <br />
                    knolwdge operated in our times, I venture this creative (and validation)
                    <br />
                    theme has not much changed, and it won't. Scholarship (in its
                    <br />
                    interdisciplinary splendors) should be mentioned too.
                    <br />
                <p>The &quot;descend&quot; is much different. Although both are social-communal
                    <br />
                    processes, their differences cannot be more pronounced. Who
                    <br />
                    &quot;mandates&quot;for the descend, for the application? Rarely it will be the
                    <br />
                    imagination or the ingenuity of an individual (the isolated, creative
                    <br />
                    technologist). Rather, it will be mandated by a corporate body, perhaps the
                    <br />
                    &quot;committee&quot;, which may be present under multiple forms in an heterogeneous
                    <br />
                    collision of industrial companies, developers, institutions, the military,
                    <br />
                    political entities of all kind, markets, fashions, ideologies, etc., etc.,
                    <br />
                    who just want some bits of science &quot;on tap&quot; so to increase some apparent
                    <br />
                    &quot;utilities&quot; around. Application of science is thus marked by an
                    <br />
                    extraordinary heterogeneity of influences that continuously &quot;elbow&quot; on each
                    <br />
                    other, with the result that the extra-ordinary action capabilities allowed
                    <br />
                    by the clouds of scientific knowledge often become a destructive force
                    <br />
                    (Stan's).
                    <br />
                <p>All this means that the social &quot;closure&quot; of the two arrows of scientific
                    <br />
                    knowledge is quite peculiar and asymmetric indeed (in this, it far
                    <br />
                    separates from our own personal &quot;closure&quot; in the action/perception cycle
                    <br />
                    where symmetry considerations are really crucial---Berthoz's and Michel
                    <br />
                    Leyton's stuff could bring quite intriguing reflections on this regard).
                    <br />
                    All this also means the importance, in my personal opinion, of exploring
                    <br />
                    new approaches and angles about the heterogeneous collisions of knowledge
                    <br />
                    realms, starting by mopping up the misconceptions existing in our own house
                    <br />
                    of the sciences (Bob's on Wilsonian reductive consilience).
                    <br />
                <p>But, Have we been --both Wilson and herein at fis discussions-- performing
                    <br />
                    an undue overstretching on Whewhell's consilience? It is really a serious
                    <br />
                    question. Should we change gears, pay our respect to a very elegant
                    <br />
                    historical concept, and look for a new term? My own excuse to keep
                    <br />
                    defending the enlarged use of consilience is that finally heterogeneous
                    <br />
                    inductions --even of different disciplines and even of different realms of
                    <br />
                    knowledge-- have to &quot;conciliate&quot; each other in our own practice too,
                    <br />
                    Perhaps implying a common mental mechanism beyond the metaphorical abuse?
                    <br />
                <p>best
                    <br />
