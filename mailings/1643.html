I will try to express the idea... 
<br />

<br />
Originally Zipf and recently  Ramon Ferrer i Cancho, Richard V. Sole (2003)
<br />
both attribute Zipf's law to the principle of &quot;least effort&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Now let me translate your question 'how does  &quot;data to being plotted as a
<br />
power laws suggest systematicity&quot; ?' to 'how can the principle of the least
<br />
effort relate with systematicity in terms of structure of a system ?' 
<br />

<br />
Possible answer...
<br />
Systems evolve or grow, they respond to changes in their environment, they
<br />
have to optimize their structure and performance for optimal functioning
<br />
(being a structural part of other systems), or in other words systems
<br />
communicate with their environment. Something that is 'not a system' does
<br />
not 'care' about optimization of it's performance, growth, development,
<br />
adaptation, or any sort of evolution, energy saving (principle of least
<br />
efforts) or structural change simply because of the absence of any internal
<br />
organization or structure or feedback loop between the 'non-system' or 
<br />
random system' and it's environment. Its history should be uniform:  no
<br />
changes in structure, no development, no growth, no evolution, no function,
<br />
no communication - no need for the least effort... 
<br />

<br />
As a consequence a structure of any system facing the entropy should be
<br />
organized in such a way as to oppose the II-nd law and optimize its
<br />
performance against energy losses - e.g. the principle of least effort that
<br />
is true for language also works elsewhere (any other communication). How
<br />
does it look like ? 
<br />
Design features of a communication system are the result of interaction
<br />
between the constraints and demands of the job required (Hauser, M.D., 1996.
<br />
The evolution of communication). Probably differentiation of parts according
<br />
to their functioning scales is the right answer. So we have several large
<br />
elements performing some specific functions, and much larger amounts of
<br />
smaller elements that do 'finer and more precise functionality'. And it is
<br />
likely that aranging systems internals (elements, design features,
<br />
communication system) according to Zipf's law is the optimal solution. Thus
<br />
my speculative (as always :) ) conclusion would be that zipf's law is
<br />
observed in systems trying to compensate entropy related energy or
<br />
information loss. If it is 'not a system' - it will not try to optimize
<br />
anything... And it's elements will not follow the Zipf's law. The same as a
<br />
dice or a coin will not attempt to optimize themselves (and the random
<br />
result they produce) according to environmental conditions...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
We have had many interesting comments about power laws from Victoras (and
<br />
Loet) but I am afraid I have not yet seen an answer to my question, which I
<br />
repeat again:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, given that one can find power laws EVERYWHERE in ALL KINDS of data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material and linguistic (just as one can do statistics anywhere), how do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you (Victoras) construe it that the susceptibility of data to being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;plotted as a power laws suggest systematicity? What would be an Xi by i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(rank) plot have to look like in order to falsify the hypothesis that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;power law plots suggest systematicity?
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I ask this because I believe that there could be no observations of ranked
<br />
data that could falsify the hypothesis that power law &quot;behavior&quot; (chaotic
<br />
fluctuations) is a sign of systematicity in the source of the data. An
<br />
attempt to perturb the data will just change the slope of the log-log plot.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In my current(ly evolving) view, power law fluctuations result when
<br />
different fluctuations are partly reinforced to different degrees by energy
<br />
gradient dissipations, and would, if the system had reached equilibrium,
<br />
been random fluctuations instead. In the limit, where fluctuations are
<br />
being &quot;used&quot; by a system, their randomness would get converted to power law
<br />
configurations. For example, I cut up tree saplings into equal sized
<br />
pieces and weighed the dried pieces. I found the weights to make a power
<br />
law when ranked. To me this is evidence that branching in trees is
<br />
RANDOMLY initiated, but subsequent growth is driven by energy gradients.
