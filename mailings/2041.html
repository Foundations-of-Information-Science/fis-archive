                <p>
                    I'll present some brief ideas on entropy, networks and the present
                    <br />
                    thread, which is far from being mature, but perhaps it can be
                    <br />
                    chiseled into a better form. This way, we'll see the connection between
                    <br />
                    the seemingly far-fetched philosophical discussion and the topic of the
                    <br />
                    present thread.
                    <br />
                <p>1. ENTROPY FOR HIERARCHIES
                    <br />
                <p>Let's focus on the level of a (possibly compound) system, composed of
                    <br />
                    components, which are themselves composed from molecules. The energy
                    <br />
                    posessed by the components is X, and the energy posessed by the
                    <br />
                    molecules is Y. The total energy is X+Y, and this is interpreted as
                    <br />
                    fixed in most contexts of thermodynamics, but we interpret Y as entropy.
                    <br />
                    The second law of thermodynamics can be interpreted as saying that
                    <br />
                    whatever you do, molecules never take less than the components.
                    <br />
                <p>Let's take this to economics: the funds of a corporation are X, the
                    <br />
                    funds of its employees are Y. In a zero-sum game, closed system,
                    <br />
                    X+Y=constant. Whatever goes on, employees won't give their money to the
                    <br />
                    corporation, but will happily take money from the corporation. This way,
                    <br />
                    we can predict the dispersal of the corporation. HENCE, the corporation
                    <br />
                    can only exist when there is an inflow of funds from outside. This
                    <br />
                    doesn't mean that everyone in a corporation will happily disperse: there
                    <br />
                    can be sub-corporate entities that cut in the intermediate space between
                    <br />
                    the corporation as a whole and an individual employee.
                    <br />
                <p>The message is that when you have an emergent system, such as the body
                    <br />
                    or a corporation, it is built on simpler systems that are only involved
                    <br />
                    in cooperative behavior so that their own energy is maintained or increased.
                    <br />
                <p>The other message is that unless you take take entropy as a metaphor,
                    <br />
                    it's easy to dismiss as &quot;reductionist&quot;.
                    <br />
                <p>2. EMOTION, HOPE, SUSTAINABILITY, SURVIVAL
                    <br />
                <p>I'm going to be quite un-romantically neo-Darwinian now, to everyone's
                    <br />
                    chagrin, I guess...
                    <br />
                <p>Emotion can be seen as an evolved mechanism to keep human beings
                    <br />
                    cooperating (attachment, friendship), surviving (fear, disgust),
                    <br />
                    reproducing (love), and taking care of their offspring (parental love,
                    <br />
                    generosity) in their pursuit of happiness. The quiet integrating inertia
                    <br />
                    of emotion protects against the brittle differentiating chaotic nature
                    <br />
                    of reason.
                    <br />
                <p>Maximizing the sheer number of humans *counters* with their ability to
                    <br />
                    survive in the long run: this leads to the degradation of the
                    <br />
                    environment, to an increased risk of quickly transmitted diseases. No,
                    <br />
                    this is not the goal. The goal is balancing on the Quality(cultural,
                    <br />
                    sexual and Darwinian selection)~Quantity(cultural and sexual
                    <br />
                    reproduction, cellular division).
                    <br />
                <p>So evolution takes place at many levels. The key realization is that one
                    <br />
                    level sits on top of other levels. You cannot survive under an x-ray
                    <br />
                    machine because your cells are dependent on stable molecules and atoms.
                    <br />
                    A culture that consumes its people in wars, or expends its best people
                    <br />
                    without letting them reproduce (e.g., through an overextended education
                    <br />
                    that interferes with reproduction), is a dying one. See the failure of
                    <br />
                    communism/socialism, see the failure of nazism, see the failure of
                    <br />
                    industrial age capitalism, and perhaps the impeding failure of systems
                    <br />
                    that currently exist: these were the cultures that didn't pay attention
                    <br />
                    to the level they were built upon (the productive culture-building
                    <br />
                    people in contrast to the unproductive and selfish). That's one aspect
                    <br />
                    of what sustainability is about, the other is the environment. Or
                    <br />
                    perhaps I should call it survivability, not sustainability.
                    <br />
                <p>Now my version of Pascal wager. I don't know what's the case:
                    <br />
                    a) there is a sustainable way, there is a meaning
                    <br />
                    b) there is none.
                    <br />
                <p>I do know what are my options:
                    <br />
                    1) learn, work hard and hope
                    <br />
                    2) give up
                    <br />
                <p>The outcomes
                    <br />
                    a)&amp;1) = win
                    <br />
                    a)&amp;2) = lose
                    <br />
                    b)&amp;1) = lose
                    <br />
                    b)&amp;2) = lose
                    <br />
                <p>Therefore, learn what there is, pick something that's worth believing
                    <br />
                    into, and then hope for the best, working hard. I won't sacrifice myself
                    <br />
                    for a culture that I don't believe is sustainable, though.

                <p>I was merely trying to concoct a physicalist theory of meaning in terms
                    <br />
                    of Stan's hierarchies: the higher level is the 'meaning' of the lower

                    level, and the lower level is the 'fact' to a higher level. This way one

                    avoids the recursive self-referential loop (What is A to A? What is the

                <p>We are able to think about societies, their purpose and meaning, so we
                    <br />
                    are indeed able to think of things that are greater than we are. Even
                    <br />
                    our own thinking about our own purpose and meaning is an example of
                    <br />
                    this. Of course, the thinking is not complete and perfect, but if one
                    <br />
                    accepts that thinking is essentially a web of constructs, we can discuss
                    <br />
                    different theories of meaning: all of them are oversimplified, but some
                    <br />
                    we might like better than the others.

                    perished, and I'm sure this is the case of philosophy as well. Beware
                    <br />
                    the trap: if you can remember it, it hasn't perished yet.

                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus, the natural (&quot;biological&quot;) order of things is a dangerous
                    </em><br />

                    </em><br />
                <p>Agreed. But naturalistic approaches do speak of co-evolution between
                    <br />
                    culture and population, so the workers in the area are well aware of the
                    <br />
                    problem. The devices, however, are at a lower level, see culture as an
                    <br />
                    emergent phenomenon, but do not model it (with some exceptions, see
                    <br />
                    &quot;memes&quot;). It's the same as the interface between chemistry and biology,
                    <br />
                    or between psychology and sociology.
                    <br />
                <p>While chemistry and biology, psychology and sociology peacefully
                    <br />
                    coexist, humanists and naturalists keep throwing insults at one another.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Most naturalists don't take the time to understand philosophy and just
                    <br />
                    ridicule it and dismiss it in their naive overconfidence; most humanists
                    <br />
                    fear the one-sided uninformed brashness of naturalists, and then employ
                    <br />
                    scare tactics. I guess the problem is in the competition between
                    <br />
                    psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and between sociology and
                    <br />
                    evolutionary psychology. With the escalated temper at both sides, there
                    <br />
                    is rarely an opportunity to exchange ideas.
