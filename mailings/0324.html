CALL for PAPERS and COMMENTS in order to participate in the Symposium II (W/H)
<br />
<p><p>&quot;Wholism (or Holism) The way forward into the 21st century&quot;
<br />
<p><p>?ß&quot;#&quot;&quot;§=&lt;&quot;
<br />
<p>This Symposium is one of the events that has been planned as an Homage to
<br />
Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy. It has been conceived as a FORUM for
<br />
presentation of papers, lectures, speeches, posters and also an Open Space
<br />
for self-organized debates and discussions. It will take place in the
<br />
<p>International Conference on Systems Thinking Globally Concerned
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy Anniversary Conference BAC 2001
<br />
<p>UNITY &lt;==&gt; through &lt;==&gt; DIVERSITY
<br />
<p>November 1-4, 2001
<br />
<p>University of Vienna and Vienna University of Technology
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
<p>&quot;+§&quot;()&quot;§-&quot;,&gt;
<br />
<p>It aims at searching further how human beings may and also should learn to
<br />
develop their way of thinking for clearly seeing the forest before they may
<br />
start dealing with one or another tree; and also for grasping the meaning
<br />
of a tree before trying to handle one of the leaves or a flower or a fruit.
<br />
<p>This intention takes into account that the Bacon's experimental method and
<br />
the Galileo's resolutive or analytic method which made possible the
<br />
emergence of the scientific method against the methaphysical approach
<br />
(apparently holistic) of the middle Ages have caused an increasing number
<br />
of larger difficulties to the evolvement of human thinking which
<br />
intrinsically searchs first to get a gestalt, global, molar, integrative,
<br />
organismic, synergistic,...or holistic or wholistic.view of the reality.
<br />
Humans could not survive if they were not capable of getting immediately
<br />
holistic insights about their concerns. But humans may and perhaps even
<br />
should push ahead the evolvement of their thinking recognizing (W)Holism as
<br />
an indispensable step.
<br />
<p>(W)Holism is an approach that transcends both the metaphysical approach of
<br />
the Middle Ages and the scientific method, which has shown during the last
<br />
century that the successful conquest and transformation of natural
<br />
resources carried out by masses of people employed as human resources
<br />
generates huge and quite undesirable effects (wrongly qualified as side
<br />
ones) that make its assumed positive contributions more and more
<br />
questionable. (W)Holism is potentially more than just a  global,
<br />
integrative or gestalt view that simply states that the &quot;whole is more than
<br />
the sum of its parts&quot; or that 'everything is interrelated with everything
<br />
else.&quot; Its belated emergence as a truly organismic and synergistic view of
<br />
life on this planet has started to help an increasing number of
<br />
researchers, scholars and experts to recognize  that wholes and parts are
<br />
all moulded into an inseparable multilevelled continuum, a living matrix.
<br />
The ecosphere, the biosphere, the homosphere, the forest, the tree, the
<br />
leaves, the cells in the leaves, the living beings,...   and the molecules
<br />
are integral components of a substance composed of
<br />
matter-energy-information  which human beings should not continue dividing
<br />
unilaterally for making short term monetary and financial profits. At
<br />
present, humankind faces  global problems reaching a crisis point. The main
<br />
reason for this is that  prevailing decision-making processes completely
<br />
ignore the need for respecting a wholeness required to counteract the
<br />
devastating consequences of 'scientific' fragmentation.
<br />
