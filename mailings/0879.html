<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in relations. And, that there are different modes of time.
</em><br />
<p>I think that what Edwina says about time is exactly right. It is worth
<br />
expanding on a bit. The same idea applies to space, where the basic
<br />
argument for immanence is easier to see. Newton introduced
<br />
absolute space and time over and above the relative space and time
<br />
in order to account for inertial forces. The way that time comes into
<br />
the argument is not obvious, so I will set that aside for a moment,
<br />
and consider just the spatial side of the argument.
<br />
<p>Basically, Newton's argument is an empirical argument to the best
<br />
explanation. He would have called it a deduction from the phenomena,
<br />
but the argument is really an inductive one, with an abductive element.
<br />
First he considers relative locations and times, as we observe and
<br />
measure them. He has two lines of argument that the relative versions
<br />
are not sufficient. The first is metaphysical, and it is generally rejected
<br />
nowadays, and was never widely accepted by his contemporaries.
<br />
Leibniz and Berkely, in particular, developed very effective arguments
<br />
against metaphysical versions of absolute space.
<br />
<p>The second argument, known as the bucket argument, starts
<br />
with the observation that if we spin a bucket of water, the water first
<br />
remains flat, but as it picks up momentum from the bucket, its
<br />
surface becomes concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water
<br />
continues to spin, and the surface of the water remains concave.
<br />
Note that we have three states to compare: 1) the bucket, rotates;
<br />
the water does not; the water is flat; 2) both rotate; the water is
<br />
concave; 3) the water rotates; the bucket does not; the water
<br />
is concave. Newton noted that the relative motion between the
<br />
water and bucket is not the relevant factor. What is? Traditionally,
<br />
it is called object alpha. Note how the argument for object alpha works:
<br />
there is a difference, so something must be postulated to
<br />
explain the difference (from Newton's rules of reasoning). None
<br />
of the things mentioned in the bucket experiment can be object
<br />
alpha, so it must be something not mentioned. Given the presumed
<br />
universality of bucket type experiments, object alpha must be
<br />
very special, being everywhere, and having the same sort of
<br />
effect -- it has to have very special invariant properties. Newton
<br />
thought that absolute space was the best candidate. From this,
<br />
and the connection between space and time in his dynamics,
<br />
we also require absolute time (if time is relational, then the dynamics
<br />
won't be general).
<br />
<p>The bucket argument is not met by any of the arguments of Newton's
<br />
contemporaries that raised metaphysical objections. Part of the
<br />
reason is that the argument is an empirical one, not a metaphysical
<br />
argument (Koyre is just wrong when he claims that Newton parted
<br />
with his empiricism in postulating absolute space and time).
<br />
<p>Mach argued that other things could do the job, like the distributed
<br />
matter of the universe. Unfortuantely, nobody has been able to show how
<br />
Mach's Principle would work, so his possibility claim is suspect.
<br />
Einstein took one part of Mach's argument seriously, though. mach
<br />
had noted that if space and time played the role Newton said it
<br />
did, then it violated Newton's law of reaction -- since it is unaffected
<br />
at the same time it has dynamical effects (Aristotle's Prime Mover
<br />
is equally weird from a causal point of view). So, Einstein dropped
<br />
this assumption, and we got relative space and time. it is also
<br />
required to make mechanics consistent with electrodynamics,
<br />
so it is also empirically supported, not just for this metaphysical
<br />
reason coming from Mach.
<br />
<p>So, the immanence of space and time is an empirical matter,
<br />
soundly and firmly established.
<br />
<p>On the other hand, information is also closely related to logic,
<br />
and logic was separated from psychology and other empirical
<br />
studies by Frege and Husserl in  Europe, and Peirce in America,
<br />
at great length, and I think convincingly. Peirce also related logic
<br />
to information.
<br />
<p>My own feeling is that the concept of information transcends
<br />
the distinction between Platonic and Aristotelian versions of
<br />
morphs, and that is one of its strengths.
