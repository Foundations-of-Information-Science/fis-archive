<p>
Dear Pavel and colleagues,
<br />
<p>I keep interested in the value theme, basically for two reasons. On the one 
<br />
side, if the whole economic system has entered in a vertiginous path of 
<br />
'irrational exuberance' (most of it automatically guided by global 
<br />
computerized systems and self-sufficient management elites) hardly 
<br />
sustainable by the planet, we must look in all possible depth at those tiny 
<br />
'bits' that connect the Big Automaton with our individual decisions and 
<br />
actions. So I am much interested on hearing from other FIS parties about 
<br />
the different economic views historically connecting, for instance, 'value 
<br />
of use' with 'value of change' and the dynamics of the pricing systems. 
<br />
Besides I think that our social use (probably in almost every language) of 
<br />
a common term both for economic and moral 'value', suggests that a 
<br />
homologous mental mechanism is in action when we build hierarchies between 
<br />
social values and when we attribute some price (a cardinal number more or 
<br />
less fine-tuned) to the exchange of some economic item. Actually both 
<br />
operations could be contemplated as fitness instantiations: as attempts to 
<br />
behave appropriately in order to thrive, or just survive, in a very complex 
<br />
social setting... Maybe we have not properly connected yet economics with 
<br />
the basic informational (communication) themes raised by Jerry at the 
<br />
Introduction.
<br />
<p>About the 'concrete wall' I like the metaphor, and I also share most of the 
<br />
views and other vivid metaphors about sustainability in other messages. 
<br />
But, in the historical aspects, I would emphasize the role of science 
<br />
--concretely the scientific revolution-- in the onset of the industrial 
<br />
revolution. Classical Mechanics did a lot to precipitate the new industrial 
<br />
world, including the promotion of a new materialist (mechanistic) 
<br />
cosmovision almost blind on any non-numerical aspect of our lives. 
<br />
Ironically, mechanicism was shared by two opposed sides of the social 
<br />
unrest of that time, particularly in Europe: Marxist 'social masses' 
<br />
'productive forces' 'political forces' irreversible social processes' 
<br />
'revolutions'... a genuine 'social mechanics' indeed (even dancing itself 
<br />
was mechanized: see the very interesting comments by Tolstoi and by Lewis 
<br />
Mumford on 'waltz').
<br />
<p>Unfortunately mechanistic reductionism is still rampant in economic schools 
<br />
opposed to established econometrics, now in the entropy basis. Some 
<br />
sentences in Sergio's last posting are really difficult to handle: &quot;Seeds, 
<br />
money, DNA, books, software, religions, cities, database, have no hope to 
<br />
last, reproduce, or even survive against the law of entropy, if resource 
<br />
flows are not provided every day to counter their degradation.&quot; That 
<br />
sentence (and the whole paragraph) implies hard core reductionism that 
<br />
keeps ahead with the existing confusion and unidimensionality, particularly 
<br />
about information. Apart from being wrong (entropy analysis of DNA???, or 
<br />
of seeds???), it is self-defeating in terms of grounding a new integrative 
<br />
contemplation of our contemporary problems. It is a very serious 
<br />
criticism  to apply to most authors of the ecological-economic field 
<br />
(Martinez Allier's paragraph cited by Sergio, or Herman Daly himself, 
<br />
Enzo... ). This current will hardly succeed in the 'paradigm clash' with 
<br />
conventional econometrics if they do not radically depart from any 'social 
<br />
mechanics' foundations. At the time being, no one has the good recipe about 
<br />
how to do that ---in my opinion, it is a common problem that could also 
<br />
concern fis information scientists: how to advance towards a sophisticate 
<br />
view of social economic information processes beyond the self-complacient, 
<br />
technoutopian and unidimensional views of 'information society'?.
<br />
<p>I will try to put in a better form the above ideas. It would be great if we 
<br />
could finally produce in this discussion a bunch of distinctions similar to 
<br />
the ones we did on biological information. (for our colleagues just arrived 
<br />
to this list, a perusal of the recent discussions we had on 'molecular 
<br />
recognition' and biological information would be very interesting: 
<br />
particularly that one cannot lump together the very different classes and 
<br />
dynamics of bioinformational processes, and if one does, well the strategic 
<br />
distinctions become completely lost.)
<br />
<p>all the best
<br />
<p>Pedro
