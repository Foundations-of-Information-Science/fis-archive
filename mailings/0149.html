<p>
Ted and fis-lers,
<br />
here some comments, so that we may continue to grow together:
<br />
<p>Goranson wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...allows us to posit an anti-entropic (or extropic)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanics. Here, &quot;lost information&quot; instead of being lost, adds to the
</em><br />
form
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and strength of the law at work. The clock creates itself and the laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;under which it operates by being and operating as a clock.
</em><br />
<p>G.St:
<br />
&quot;extropic&quot; is not a usual expression, I think it was already introduced
<br />
calling it &quot;anatropic&quot;. But that4s not my main point. I agree with adding
<br />
in stead of losing information: thats done, as we know, by synergy and
<br />
self-organisation effects.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;....for now, let's just look at implications for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the social/cultural level. I suppose that the situation is not a simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;layer cake with fundamental particles at the bottom and societies at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;top. Instead, this is a circular collection. The top/bottom layer is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we've filled with the blunt concept of God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The leverage here is that we now have a layer above the social/cultural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;layer and an outline for an info(3) which are the extropic principles. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the analogy of the observer status except the observer is the universe.
</em><br />
<p>Theyr is no doubt that the layer-approach is useful, when seen as a
<br />
circular one. You argue to look at the interesting &quot;places&quot; on bounderies
<br />
between the layers, to complete fis-vision created in Vienna. I second this
<br />
ideia. But we know also, that when you do the cicle between the layers you
<br />
will have to put together the first with the  last one, i.e. psico-socios
<br />
and physics. &quot;God&quot; or &quot;accident&quot; (Zufall) had to be invoced to explain.
<br />
Thats, I think you will agree, where we all (fis-lers or not) struggle. We
<br />
did not connect yet these gaps, because energy-transformation betweenn
<br />
psi-soc and phy was not descovered. Now, that we know that there is
<br />
information-energy, I will call it just information, we can build upon it.
<br />
Is it not that what fis tries to do?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;---information is not only the principle around which systems organize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within laws, but is also the principle around which the universe organizes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those laws;
</em><br />
<p>You confirm that information organizes at the phy-soc boundary.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;---once again, examination of the social/cultural layer is the high payoff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;area here, this time on the boundary above;
</em><br />
<p>You confirm that some of the fis-questions may be &quot;solved&quot; by
<br />
boundary-research.
<br />
<p>So let me take this argument to try to lead to something  essential:What4s
<br />
that boundary4s nature?
<br />
<p>Resuming original fis-thoughts produced in a project with Hofkirchner,
<br />
Fenzl et al. at the TU Vienna, boundaries are &quot;methods&quot; to put together
<br />
different layers of evolution. Yet, the layers-approach is productive only
<br />
when connected soc to bio or bio-phy. But it does not really work when
<br />
connecting phy-soc.
<br />
Although, some interesting theories are suggesting methods of connection.
<br />
There is e.g. the quantum-mind approach, which looks at human consciousness
<br />
as a physical field- process at the sub-atomic level. (See mail by A. Comb
<br />
to subscribe list &quot;QM&quot;, where also literature is abundant).
<br />
Another approach comes from fis-steps themselves. I will call it the
<br />
&quot;information-energy approach&quot;, as we do it e.g. in sociological
<br />
systems-theory (following Habermas, Luhmann a.o.).
<br />
But until now there has not been a substantial result on the comprovation
<br />
of this theories. Indeed, experiments in the soc-information field have not
<br />
been accompained suffficiently by quantum-physics, and vice-versa. So, how
<br />
to get together?
<br />
<p>Closing my statement
<br />
Best Wishes
<br />
