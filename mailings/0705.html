<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>Dear Friends and Sentient Beings,
<br />
<p>I want you to know about this action that began in a conversation group
<br />
in its fourth meeting here in Santa Cruz a couple of weeks ago.
<br />
<p>Would you get it out to your extensive network?  This is just the
<br />
beginning. Nine months later on Mothers Day we will have another one and 
<br />
another one and on and on and on till REAL changes are made.
<br />
<p>Love and thanks for all your forwards,
<br />
Barbara
<br />
<p><p>Women Strike 11-11
<br />
<p>A worldwide day to raise consciousness and stand up to proclaim that:
<br />
<p>&#x2026; We CAN live together in joy and celebration without fear and
<br />
deprivation.
<br />
<p>&#x2026; We CAN stop the insanity of greed and violence which is driving
<br />
humanity to its own annihilation.
<br />
<p>&#x2026; Many of us CAN stop the destructive actions of the few.
<br />
<p>This is a call to gather together in celebration of respect for all life
<br />
<p>and all love.
<br />
<p>Women-
<br />
Stop offering your service at work and in your communities
<br />
on 11-11-02, and beyond as needed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like-hearted men please support the women in your life to participate.
<br />
<p>Why Women?
<br />
Women contribute fully 2/3 of the work in the world with next to no
<br />
voice among the leadership of the world. By this call, we can stop
<br />
the world and the destructive path of the world leaders. The values of
<br />
nurturing, kindness, caring, dignity, integrity, -and loving one
<br />
another have been turned upside down and ignored far too long.
<br />
<p>The themes of terrorism and retaliation are rooted in the loss of human
<br />
dignity and disregard for human life. They are promoted by
<br />
focusing on our differences without recognizing our interconnectedness.
<br />
We all know the horrors plaguing our world. Thousands of
<br />
children die daily of starvation. Too many people are homeless. Yet, the
<br />
<p>knowledge, technology and resources are available to feed, clothe
<br />
and house every person on earth without harm. The global economy is
<br />
collapsing as untold billions of dollars are diverted to wars and to
<br />
the pockets of a few executives. Women do not give birth to watch our
<br />
babies die in war and poverty and our families devastated.
<br />
<p>This is a human call that transcends politics, cultures, and religions
<br />
because we are all impacted by the insanity. Insanity is doing the
<br />
same thing over and over and thinking the results will be different. We
<br />
have thought we were powerless, therefore we were powerless.
<br />
As women, constituting over 51% of the population, we are powerful; our
<br />
numbers can demand and create the changes that are
<br />
desperately needed. As women, we have had to do many things in our lives
<br />
<p>when we didn't know how to do them. Yet we knew they had
<br />
to be done, so we set our intention and somehow accomplished our goal.
<br />
<p>We also know we can work together - we jump to immediate action in a
<br />
crisis for our family, friends and neighbors during illness,
<br />
natural disaster or direct attack. Is not the crisis of all the wars in
<br />
our world sufficient to take a stand now? Is not the economic crisis
<br />
created by the philosophy of greed as devastating as any natural
<br />
disaster?
<br />
<p>Let us all join together on 11-11, in the streets and in spirit, to make
<br />
<p>the transformation we know in our hearts is needed for us to
<br />
survive and thrive. The time is Now. In the spirit of celebration, we
<br />
strike the tone of how we want to live. Fear is a strategy to keep us
<br />
powerless. Don't fall victim to it. Let the strength of our numbers and
<br />
commitment show the world we must change now.
<br />
<p>Nobel Plea for Justice
<br />
&quot;To survive in the world ... we must learn to think in a new way.
<br />
As never before, the future of each depends on the goodness of all.&quot;
<br />
Nobel Laureates, Nobel Peace Prize Centennial Symposium, December 6,
<br />
2001
<br />
<p><p>Suggested Actions for Women Strike 11-11
<br />
o Send this notice to everyone you know.
<br />
o Stop work for one day or more to gather and celebrate our connection
<br />
(as long as it doesn't put you at personal risk
<br />
or extreme economic hardship.)
<br />
o Wear purple, if possible.
<br />
o Gather peacefully in your town center, on your block or in your living
<br />
<p>room. Invite others to gather with you or if
<br />
you can't gather, hold this action in your heart.
<br />
o Have all the bells of your community ring together at 12 noon in your
<br />
town and ring your own.
<br />
o Choose a specific time for a connecting activity. Make it simple,
<br />
human and meaningful: meet and greet each other
<br />
with respect, honor and joy.
<br />
o For large public gatherings please check if you need permits.
<br />
o Create a local fund for women who cannot afford to take a day off.
<br />
<p>What do we want?
<br />
A new agenda that asks different Questions
<br />
o How can we assure real peace talks in the mid-east immediately?
<br />
o What commitments can leaders make to end homelessness and poverty now?
<br />
<p>o How can funds be diverted from military rule to humane efforts?
<br />
o How can we work towards safety, peace &amp; harmony among all the peoples
<br />
of the world?
<br />
o When will policies of terrorism, racism, corporate manipulation and
<br />
government abuse of power cease?
<br />
o What more is needed to support and build the peace economy?
<br />
o Add your own questionsSS
<br />
<p>Why 11-11 as the day for Striking &amp; Celebration of Our Humanity?
<br />
Very importantly 11-11 is Remembrance Day for Europe and Veterans Day
<br />
for the United States, the day to celebrate
<br />
the end of all wars, the end of World War I in 1918. Obviously, that did
<br />
<p>not happen. Let's make that happen now.
<br />
<p>Why Participate in Women Strike 11-11?
<br />
This is a simple action that everyone can do, with little funding or
<br />
planning, and most importantly the only affiliation
<br />
needed is to be a member of the human race who is fed up with the
<br />
horrors and stupidity of war, greed and
<br />
deprivation.
<br />
<p>Our current political, social, religious, civic and economic activities
<br />
and theories have not been able to stop the many
<br />
horrors in our world. Women Strike 11-11 is not presenting any specific
<br />
philosophy except that we are all human and
<br />
we are all affected by the insanity. The very act of coming together
<br />
will accomplish much: show the world just how
<br />
great the numbers are who want change, provide the foundation for new
<br />
ideas, meet and greet our community.
<br />
<p>We cannot wait in fear and trembling, praying for the &quot;powers that be&quot;
<br />
to change. We must live that change and
<br />
announce it to the world. Gandhi and Martin Luther King achieved change
<br />
- we are the change. A day of striking from
<br />
work and gathering to celebrate will ignite this change.
<br />
When people can hold the vision of a world in joy with basic human needs
<br />
<p>met, they change their lives. When enough
<br />
people do this, the world changes.
<br />
<p>Genesis of Women Strike 11-11
<br />
This idea could have come from any number of people or groups worldwide
<br />
who are deeply concerned with the status
<br />
of our world. However, a small group of 10 women, aged 35 to 94 were
<br />
meeting bi-weekly for 2 months because of
<br />
their frustration and sense of hopelessness with the world situations.
<br />
These women brainstormed Women Strike. They
<br />
realized that the power of the Internet and individual networking could
<br />
generate the numbers to make an impact.
<br />
<p>Reach &amp; Impact of Women Strike 11-11
<br />
o In the first week we have contacts in 23 countries. Please extend our
<br />
reach around the world.
<br />
o The goal is to have individuals and groups worldwide from all walks of
<br />
<p>life, cultures, religions, political, civic, and social
<br />
affiliations to spread the word and participate in the Women Strike.
<br />
o The more women in communities worldwide who participate in small and
<br />
large groups, and notify the press in their
<br />
area, the more effective Women Strike 11-11 will be.
<br />
<p>Please let us know what you're doing through our web site or by writing
<br />
or calling.
<br />
<p><p><p>Women Strike was birthed in the home of a 94 year old woman who
<br />
remembers
<br />
that when she was ten years old she was filled with the incredible joy
<br />
of celebrating 11-11-1918 which was declared Armistice Day.
<br />
The joy was that this was the end of the war that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;was promised to be the end all wars.
<br />
Let us fulfill that promise!
