<p>
Guy, and others --
<br />
<p>Guy has a realist take on power laws.  In effect, one could say that, in
<br />
any collection of the same kinds of events (say, earthquakes), it will be
<br />
the case that there will be far fewer large, powerful examples, and more
<br />
and more examples as one tallies weaker and weaker ones.  In texts, one
<br />
finds some words used very infrequently and more words used more frequently
<br />
(Zipf's Law).  This dichotomizing is the material substance of power laws.
<br />
These data can be plotted as magnitude (Xi) or frequency (Pi) by rank (i),
<br />
and will show a long tail into smaller (or rarer) instances.  So, looking
<br />
at ensemble data, here we are focusing dichotomously, on the relative
<br />
amounts of large magnitude (or common) versus small magnitude (or rare)
<br />
values.  This technique can be useful in comparing the slopes of log Xi by
<br />
log i plots.  For example, Zipf found that all kinds of texts he
<br />
investigated in many languages all had the same slope.  Only &quot;schizophrenic
<br />
word salad&quot; had a different slope.
<br />
<p>How does this relate to frequency distributions?.  If we take the same set
<br />
of magnitude data, we could compute the frequencies of the various
<br />
magnitudes (if they aren't already frequencies, as with words in texts),
<br />
and we could plot P ( Xi) by Xi, to get a frequency distribution graph.
<br />
Immediately we see the central tendency pop out as the mode of the curve
<br />
showing as a hump.  Instead of privileging the extremes of the data as in
<br />
the power law plot based on an ordination imposed on the data from outside,
<br />
we are focusing on the middle of the data collection, which emerges from
<br />
the data itself. The technique becomes useful in statistics, where the mean
<br />
and variances of a sample can be compared with other samples.
<br />
<p>In biology and some other fields the statistical mean is often supposed to
<br />
point at some canonical value for Xi, which gets distorted in individuals
<br />
to different degrees due to historical accidents.  Whether that kind of
<br />
interpretation could work for, say, earthquakes, seems doubtful.  I know of
<br />
no comparable attempt at canonical interpretation of the slope of log Xi /
<br />
log i power plots.  Dichotomizing bigger versus smaller (size or presence),
<br />
there might be a hint in the fact that bigger systems are slower to change,
<br />
while smaller ones change more rapidly, delivering in the event more sizes
<br />
(or kinds) of small things, and fewer big ones.  In earthquakes, then,
<br />
small slippages would be more common just because fast dynamics have more
<br />
frequent results (whatever THAT could mean!).
<br />
<p>Several workers in the past (most elaborately, Belevitch, 1959, Ann. Soc.
<br />
Sci. Bruxelles 73:310-) have suggested that the power plot can be
<br />
interpreted as the cumulative probability distribution for a lognormal
<br />
probability density function, which he shows using a technique of
<br />
rearranging the data.
<br />
<p>In any case, it seems that the two techniques are mutually exclusive ways
<br />
of focusing on a data set -- the ends, or the middle.  As such, they are
<br />
techniques for probing the data -- tools for analysis.  In and of
<br />
themselves they show little about the world, other than that not all
<br />
instances of a kind of thing are identical; rather they are tools for
<br />
comparing different data sets.  A test case for the ontological perspective
<br />
might be, if we are looking at fluctuations at thermodynamic equilibrium,
<br />
we could either identify a canonical ensemble of them, showing them to be
<br />
random, or instead find them (a la Tsallis) to make up a power disribution.
<br />
I seem to be leaning toward the notion that this would depend upon one's
<br />
viewpoint on the data!
