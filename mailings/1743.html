Dear FIS discussants,
<br />
<p>There has always been a puzzle about why the mathematics has an ever 
<br />
widening role in science.  Mathematics introduces strange abstract entities 
<br />
into our representation of nature: numbers, manifolds, groups, variables, 
<br />
operators and so on.  Yet few believe that such abstract entities literally 
<br />
exist in nature.  A more plausible explanation is that mathematics provides 
<br />
a precise way of representing the STRUCTURE of the world.  It helps us see 
<br />
how things relate to each, not what things are in and of themselves.  Taking 
<br />
this line of argument to an extreme, one might claim that if the consilience 
<br />
of scientific inductions, tools, models, communities is about the 
<br />
relationship of different things to each other, then consilience is the 
<br />
basis of all our knowledge.
<br />
<p>Perception is a source of knowledge, so it provides a test of this thesis. 
<br />
On the surface, it seems to pass this test because our perceptual judgments 
<br />
of the world are based the consilience of a wealth of information coming 
<br />
from quite separate modalities--vision, hearing, touch, smell, and 
<br />
kinesthetic information.
<br />
<p>Even our detailed understanding of how visual perception works seems to 
<br />
provide a striking confirmation of this idea.  An old controversy about 
<br />
color vision was about whether color is a primary (objective) property of 
<br />
things in the world or a secondary (subjective) property.  The simple-minded 
<br />
theory of color perception says that it consists merely in the detection of 
<br />
the wavelength of light striking our retina.  This might have supported the 
<br />
view of color as a primary quality if it were true.  But it was Land's 
<br />
experiment in the middle of last century that blew this particular myth out 
<br />
of the water.
<br />
<p>Land produced three black-and-white photographic transparencies of a 
<br />
colorful scene with a camera--one with a filter that blocked all light 
<br />
except red light, one with a filter that blocked all light except yellow 
<br />
light, and one with a filter that blocked all light except blue light.  It 
<br />
is no surprise that we see the scene in full color when we reverse the 
<br />
process by projecting red, yellow and blue light simultaneously through the 
<br />
transperencies onto a screen.  This is because the retina contains three 
<br />
kinds of color sensitive receptors called cones, one most sensitive to red 
<br />
light, one most sensitive to yellow light, and one most sensitive to blue 
<br />
light.  But what happens if we replace the red, yellow and blue light with 
<br />
narrow band of yellow light shifted slightly towards red end of the 
<br />
spectrum, a narrow band of yellow light in the middle, and a narrow band of 
<br />
yellow light shifted slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum?  To 
<br />
everyone's surprise, Land demonstrated that we see the scene in full color 
<br />
(albeit slightly washed out) even though there is only yellow light striking 
<br />
our retina.  Color pereception therefore involves the detection of 
<br />
DIFFERENCES in light frequencies, and not light frequencies per se.  Color 
<br />
perception rests on the detection of relational facts.
<br />
<p>But should we therefore conclude that color is therefore a relational 
<br />
property of the objects in the world?  One might object that this would be 
<br />
to confuse what we know with how we know.  The 'how' involves the detection 
<br />
of relational facts, but the conclusion (the inductive proposition) drawn 
<br />
from these facts is about the intrinsic nature of things in the world.  For 
<br />
example, we all know that we can only measure mass RATIOS, but nobody seems 
<br />
to conclude from this that mass is therefore a relational property of 
<br />
things.
<br />
<p>Whose right?  If you have a solution, then please let me know.
<br />
<p>Malcolm
