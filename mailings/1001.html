Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>I would like to present some general views on the musical topic. From the 
<br />
informational point of view, music can be considered as some kind of a 
<br />
knowledge. But this knowledge is not a “positivistic” kind of relation 
<br />
between actual finite objects. It is a knowledge about the totality of the 
<br />
word. Music can be viewed as a reflection from the infinity (potential 
<br />
field) into the finite set of sounds. But in contrast to other arts, music 
<br />
is prolonged and organised in time. And that is its advantage.
<br />
<p>As a reflection of the total and universal of the world, music cannot be 
<br />
one-dimensional. It is polysemantic, combining different structures 
<br />
(languages) in one temporal continuum. These different structures are 
<br />
present and organised in the musical composition, and this reflects complex 
<br />
relation between the potential and the actual. The potential and the actual 
<br />
may be in harmony or the harmony can be broken, but infinity of creative 
<br />
process means that this breakage can be viewed as a higher level of harmony 
<br />
with breaking of the simple rules. This resembles symmetry-breaking 
<br />
phenomena and creation of Goedel numbers in arithmetical calculus. In 
<br />
connection with this I would recommend to have a look at works of M. 
<br />
Arcadyev. He develops ideas that music can be viewed as a structurised 
<br />
silence, and that silent accents in music play even more important roles 
<br />
than sounds. The concise presentation of these ideas (with concrete examples 
<br />
of polylanguage structures) are at
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.philosophy.ru/library/arcad/time.html">http://www.philosophy.ru/library/arcad/time.html</a>
<br />
<p>The potential field is always a contradictory set of possible realisations. 
<br />
It is silent. This set is realised as a process of appearance of sounds that 
<br />
is organised in time. The most striking example of quasi-rationality of such 
<br />
a process is a polyphonic music like fugue, such examples as the Art of 
<br />
Fugue of I.S. Bach where the musical composition becomes closer to 
<br />
mathematics.  But this process cannot be counted, it is creative, being a 
<br />
kind of construction of reflective loops as in creation of new structures of 
<br />
calculus not present in the previous structures. Mathematics and music are 
<br />
the similar arts in the Pythagorean school. Music can be more rational in 
<br />
some pieces of baroque and more irrational as in romanticism. It  may be 
<br />
more rational in form, but as a reflection of infinity it cannot be 
<br />
countable rationally. Great examples of this are the final (and actually all 
<br />
movements) of Beethoven’s Op. 106 and his Grosse Fuge. Mathematics deals 
<br />
with processes that are limits of iteration of infinite processes. But 
<br />
because of the paradoxical properties of time (described e.g. in the 
<br />
Achilles and tortoise), these limits can be realised in finite durations of 
<br />
time. Without these paradoxes music may not exist.
<br />
<p>Some words about the limits of iteration in music and universal 
<br />
combinatorial principles. V. Lefebvre suggested that the golden section is 
<br />
important in the European musical tradition. The golden ratio can be 
<br />
considered as a limit of iteration in reflective measurements (see my paper 
<br />
in FIS2002). I Ching book and the genetic code have in common that they are 
<br />
combinations of reflective triads. Realisations of these combinations are 
<br />
universal and they really contain different languages at the same time. Some 
<br />
thoughts on this topic are in my paper at
<br />
<p><a href="../../home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~igamberd/files/semiosis.html">http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~igamberd/files/semiosis.html</a>
<br />
<p>The styles in music can be viewed as different projections from the infinite 
<br />
fields. Finally, I would remind the words of Gustav Mahler: to compose a 
<br />
symphony is to construct a world by means of existing musical technique. 
<br />
Constructing a world is to realise by finite means a Ding an sich or total 
<br />
reality. Music is a powerful mean to do this.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
Andrei Igamberdiev
