                <p>
                    Dear all
                    <br />
                <p>I am sorry not have had time to participate in this discussion in this topic
                    <br />
                    I studied many years ago. But just a few words about the general
                    <br />
                    epistemological problems.
                    <br />
                <p>I agree with John in the Criticism of Arne's approach. Something more is
                    <br />
                    needed. That is why I have worked on Cybersemiotics.
                    <br />
                <p>In general a way to avoid skepticism and radical constructivist be it social
                    <br />
                    or subjective is to start where Heidegger begins. We live in a natural
                    <br />
                    practical interaction with the world. There is some kind of basic unity
                    <br />
                    between us and the world of things and others. We do differ from things
                    <br />
                    through our linguistic and reflective consciousness, which make us aware
                    <br />
                    that there could be nothing, but there is something. We are aware of the
                    <br />
                    nothingness and of our connectedness to the world.
                    <br />
                <p>This is where one can Use Peirce's Synechism, Hylozoism and firstness to get
                    <br />
                    to the foundational nature of semiotic processes.
                    <br />
                <p>My Danish colleagues Peder Voetmann Christiansen has work with this for many
                    <br />
                    years. You can find his home page here <a
                        href="../../mmf.ruc.dk/~PVC/default.htm">http://mmf.ruc.dk/~PVC/</a> with some
                    <br />
                    article on quantum semiotics of which great parts are too technical too me.
                    <br />
                    Looking forward to the specialist's opinions.

                    <br />
                    about the foundations of science, in particular information science:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />

                    </em><br />
                    whole project &#x201c;Quantum Information&#x201d; should be based on more solid
                    <br />
                    foundations. We recall that &gt;quantum mechanics by itself is a huge building
                    <br />
                    having the sand-fundament &#x2013; the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. On one
                    <br />
                    hand, there was created the &gt;advanced mathematical formalism (calculus of
                    <br />
                    probabilities in the complex Hilbert space) giving predictions which are
                    <br />
                    supported by all existing experimental data. &gt;On the other hand, it is still
                    <br />
                    unclear why this formalism works so well and moreover it is not clear what
                    <br />
                    it really predicts, because by the orthodox Copenhagen &gt;interpretation
                    <br />
                    (which is the conventional interpretation) quantum mechanics is not about
                    <br />
                    physical reality by itself, but about just our observations (of what?).

                    years became technological and business problems. (Yes and its seemed we
                    <br />
                    for some &gt;reason lost the interest in the philosophic questions &#x2013; but I
                    <br />
                    think it is simply pushed into the background because the realists cannot
                    <br />
                    straighten out the puzzle. AK)

                    <br />
                    been pushed into a discussion between realist defenders &#x2013; sort of neglecting
                    <br />
                    other possible points of view &#x2013; which make them into rippels on the surface

                    <br />
                    science we will not proceed an inch until the day we are prepared to accept
                    <br />
                    this (simple) fact that human knowing is in principle subjective. There are
                    <br />
                    several stronger reasons but the success of Copenhagen interpretation to
                    <br />
                    reject the human possibility to attribute ontological features to the
                    <br />
                    presumed reality. My claim (and SOA&#x2019;s) is that no coherent definition of
                    <br />
                    information is possible as long as we keep on trying to make reference to a
                    <br />
                    &#x201c;reality&#x201d; that is unknowable in principle. Information relates to the
                    <br />
                    speaking (modelling) knower &#x2013; and what is in his mind (his experience), just
                    <br />
                    as Bohr says. However his way of reasoning does not only apply to QM &#x2013; it
                    <br />
                    applies to all forms of knowing.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pinpoint the situation let us consider the
                    realist&#x2019;s dilemma:

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A human knower first of all needs a MODEL OF HIS
                    MIND in order to

                    consistently describe an ontological reality. However he has no model &#x2013; and
                    <br />
                    cannot even consistently dig one out.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To contemplate this situation:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume I can identify a part of space-time,
                    call it O (let it be
                    <br />
                    modelled by a cube of space-time, cloud of matter, a mathematical point or
                    <br />
                    even a thing &#x2013; no matter). The crucial question is as to whether O can be
                    <br />
                    said to emit a signal that tells me anything about O &#x2013; i.e., some feature
                    <br />
                    (property) beside the name O I have attributed to it. The assumption that
                    <br />
                    this is possible lies at the heart of IS i.e., we therefore say that such
                    <br />
                    signals contains &#x201c;information.&#x201d; This is the equivalent to assume O is the
                    <br />
                    bearer of such eventual ontological feature and such a feature should then,
                    <br />
                    according to the objectivist (and realist) be considered a pre-&#x201c;given&#x201d;
                    <br />
                    feature &#x2013; or independent of the individual observer observer-independent
                    <br />
                    (exist prior to the knowledge of the knower). One might then ask who this
                    <br />
                    very knower is &#x2013; and what is the point with human beings to search for the
                    <br />
                    ability to make a similar interpretation. But let me leave this unsolvable
                    <br />
                    question and proceed.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us instead ask: Is my assumtion of a pre-given
                    feature of O
                    <br />
                    correct?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compute some feature (property) of this
                    is presumed
                    <br />
                    entity O I then need to know what has happened to the signal on its way from
                    <br />
                    O to my consciousness &#x2013; no matter whether it is a quark, particle, thing or
                    <br />
                    even a bare state transition (assume it to be a state transition ST).
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way for me to find out how the human
                    apparatus of
                    <br />
                    perception has influenced ST on its way to consciousness is to &#x201c;send a
                    <br />
                    similar&#x201d; test signal the same way through my apparatus of perception and
                    <br />
                    compare the original test signal with the received test signal (under the
                    <br />
                    assumtion that the apparatus is stable). Then and only then he can compute a
                    <br />
                    model of my own perceptual apparatus. However such an act of computing is
                    <br />
                    not possible until I know the original test signal &#x2013; and this is not
                    <br />
                    possible because I have no model of my perceptual apparatus. (This
                    <br />
                    impossibility of comparison is most stikingly reflected in the human
                    <br />
                    monistic situation: There is only one percept!)
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can do in this embarassing situation is to
                    assume the test
                    <br />
                    signal to be &#x201c;known in advance&#x201d; i.e., pre-given. This clearly is misleading
                    <br />
                    since I then assume what I want to show. There is simply no way out if this
                    <br />
                    dilemma but assuming that the features of O are pre-given &#x2013; but such an
                    <br />
                    assumption is also clearly misleading &#x2013; for exactly the same reason. The
                    <br />
                    realist is caught in inconsistency.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see no way out of this dilemma. Can you? Or
                    maybe I am
                    <br />
                    mistaken?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Arne, colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>I don't think that this is an argument for antirealism, but for skepticism.
                    <br />
                    At least it can be made out that way, so there is another alternative. The
                    <br />
                    choice is not between just either we can check our representations against
                    <br />
                    the external world or we only have constructions (or models) to rely on, but
                    <br />
                    also we can hold our models to be falsifiable, and withhold final judgement
                    <br />
                    (this was Hume's route). This position has a very old argument in its
                    <br />
                    favour. The constructivist deviation is very recent. The problem with it is
                    <br />
                    that our models may contain information about the outside world, so to
                    <br />
                    dismiss them as not having that, and judging reality only on our models is
                    <br />
                    equally unjustified and misleading. There is an argument known to the
                    <br />
                    Greeks, called the Diallelus (the wheel). There is a discussion of it in
                    <br />
                    Nicholas Rescher, Methodological Pragmatism, New York University Press
                    <br />
                    (1977) pp. 15-18. The basic idea is that we have a means of judging truth,
                    <br />
                    or at least acceptability. Call it C. C can be any method you like, simple
                    <br />
                    or complex; it does not matter to the argument. Now we ask if C is
                    <br />
                    justified. Either the justification is in terms of C, which is circular, or
                    <br />
                    in terms of some C', different from C. If the latter, we need to ask (if we
                    <br />
                    did at first for C), is C' justified? Then we are back on the wheel, and so
                    <br />
                    on. Your argument, Arne, can be put in these terms: Let O be the truth, and
                    <br />
                    C be our perceptual apparatus; then we can know O only through C, but what
                    <br />
                    validates C? We are on the wheel, not on the route to taking models to be
                    <br />
                    the essence of reality. This can be seen easily. Suppose that we have a
                    <br />
                    criterion C for judging if our models are acceptable. What justifies C? We
                    <br />
                    are back on the wheel. I see no advantage in retreating to models as the
                    <br />
                    epistemic ground, and it smacks of a sort of verificationism to me. In any
                    <br />
                    case, it adds an epicycle to the problem that can be dealt with just by
                    <br />
                    acknowledging that perceptual apparatus and models are part of the
                    <br />
                    information we have, and we need to be sceptical about whether we are
                    <br />
                    dealing with information from the world or from our C in this case. Then we
                    <br />
                    can get down to the business of trying to figure out how to distinguish the
                    <br />
                    two classes of information (externally originated and internally
                    <br />
                    originated). The first step, I think, is to deny that we have any evidence
                    <br />
                    that there are things in themselves out there; we cannot, by postulation,
                    <br />
                    have information about them, only information transferred from them through
                    <br />
                    an information channel, which invariably adds noise, some nonrandom. So at
                    <br />
                    best we have access to information that forms patterns, some perhaps real
                    <br />
                    and objective, other parts artefactual. Is there a criterion for
                    <br />
                    distinguishing artefactuality from reality? Certainly not some C that is
                    <br />
                    infallible, or we are on the wheel, but there might be criteria that work
                    <br />
                    fairly well as long as we don't get all paranoid about certainty. In
                    <br />
                    traditional science, invariance under transformations of models has been an
                    <br />
                    important criterion (Galileo, Einstein), but certainly not the only one. It
                    <br />
                    seems to me that it can be applied to QM through a structuralist approach to
                    <br />
                    QM. I don't expect that this will move committed inernalists,
                    <br />
                    constructivists, antirealists and antimodernists (it's too early or
                    <br />
                    impossible to know what postmodernism would be -- see Bruno Latour, We Have

                    <br />
                    antirealist historian -- Maggie Osler, remarked before examining a realist
                    <br />
                    MA thesis with me, that she thought that being a realist or antirealist was
                    <br />
                    genetically determined, or at least innate. She may have been right. In any
                    <br />
                    case, the same problem of finding invariances applies to the antirealist --
                    <br />
                    they are of great scientific interest for whatever reason, but it is harder
                    <br />
                    to justify.
                    <br />
                <p>As I have mentioned previously, a number of us are producing a book What's
                    <br />
                    wrong with things?: Information-theoretic ontic structural realism, that
                    <br />
                    addresses QM this way, among other subjects. If anybody would like to read
                    <br />
                    and comment on the manuscript, please get in touch with me. It is in
                    <br />
                    revision right now, but any input we can get from this esteemed group would
                    <br />
                    be valuable. This book relies on Peirce for one major premise, but does not
                    <br />
                    investigate Peircean semiotics, which I think is required for a more
                    <br />
                    complete answer to Arne's question of a way out of the dilemma.
