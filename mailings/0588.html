<p>Oh, this can be so misleading. First, water and light don't share the same
<br />
differential equations. Some aspects of the equations are the same. Others
<br />
aren't. Second, for a long time it was assumed that water and light waves
<br />
were both forms of mechanical energy, with light waves passing through
<br />
an ether. It was quite shocking to find that light waves do not require a
<br />
mechanical medium, and the idea was given up only when it was clear
<br />
that the alternative generates really severe problems for kinematics.
<br />
<p>Ther most striking difference between thermodynamic entropy S and
<br />
Shannon entropy H is that the latter can decrease by passing through a
<br />
passive filter  (process). According to the Second Law, S cannot
<br />
decrease except thought the application of work (that is one version). So,
<br />
Shannon entropy H can violate the Second Law, if Shannon entropy and
<br />
thermodynamic entropy are the same thing, i.e., H = S by
<br />
definition.
<br />
<p>What can we conclude from this? We can conclude that there are possible
<br />
applications of the Shannon formalism that are not applications of the
<br />
formalism of statistical mechanics. It does not follow that all applications
<br />
of Shannon entropy are not applications of the formalism of statistical
<br />
mechanics. In other words, there are some models of H that are not
<br />
models of S, in the (informal) model theoretic sense. By informal here,
<br />
I mean the sense of model in which a situation or an application of
<br />
a theory can be a model (see, e.g., W. Stegmueller, the Stucturalist
<br />
Approach to Theories, 1989)
<br />
<p>As Jerry mentioned, a conversion factor is required at some point, since
<br />
all applications of statistical mechanics involve energy, but there is no
<br />
explicit role for energy in Shannon's theory. Jerry mentioned the significance
<br />
of time. Jonathan Smith has shown that if you set up a statistical approach
<br />
for information along the lines of statistical mechanics, ignoring energy
<br />
issues (this is an abstraction from energy and matter, basically) then the
<br />
units of information come out as a rate (1/t). This is not surprising, since
<br />
temperature is an average kinetic energy per degree of freedom, by
<br />
dimensional analysis. Take away the energy, and you get a rate.
<br />
<p>How to add the energy back in? It has been suggested for some seventy
<br />
years now that Botlzmann's constant is the appropriate conversion. It
<br />
works quite well if and only if one uses only applications of Shannon
<br />
in which the &quot;messages&quot; are the complexions of a physical system.
<br />
<p>Interestingly, this is not enough to ensure that H=S, since there is
<br />
the small matter of sign. Brillouin and Schroedinger both argue
<br />
that the sign for information should be negative. This resolves the
<br />
spontaneous information decrease problem, and has a lot more
<br />
going for it as well.
<br />
<p>In any case, it is much too fast to say that Shannon's formalism
<br />
and Boltzmann's have only in common a formalism. There are
<br />
ways to bring them into line, and the resulting theories can be quite
<br />
interesting and productive. The problem is in understanding the
<br />
relations between different uses of the word &quot;information&quot;, not
<br />
in getting the real Mr Information to stand up. There is no more
<br />
a real and unique information than there is a real and unique
<br />
energy, temperature, work, or for that matter, meaning. All of
<br />
these concepts are relational in their use. None of them come
<br />
uniquely in atoms. (Action does seem to come only in  atoms,
<br />
which is worth reflecting on, but right now I just want to make the
<br />
point that the relational character of information is not strange or
<br />
unusual in this respect among general and fundamental concepts
<br />
-- energies as used in physics are always energy differences
<br />
of a specific kind -- there is no such thing as energy without
<br />
a form -- depending on what one focuses attention, the energy of
<br />
something can be quite different -- the problem is to focus on the
<br />
relevant -- same for various uses of information).
<br />
<p>In any case, I think it would be as much a mistake to require
<br />
that all information must be intentional, or biological, or whatever,
<br />
as to require a priori that all energy must be mechanical. Let
<br />
us wait and find out.
