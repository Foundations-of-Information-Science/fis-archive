<p>
Most certainly abduction is a semiosic process, as is deduction and
<br />
induction. I consider the Sign, not a 'thing' but a process. A triadic
<br />
process operative as a syllogism: major premiss, minor premiss and
<br />
conclusion, with each other these three understood as Relational
<br />
interactions.
<br />
<p>The deductive Sign accepts a Law (Major Premiss) and interacts with
<br />
the external world (Minor Premiss) and interprets that interaction
<br />
into a conclusion.  This permits a reasonably cohesive world of
<br />
continuity of form, and thus, normative interactions.
<br />
The inductive Sign, uses a Law ,a Major Premiss - but that Law is
<br />
formed very differently from the Deductive Sign. The deudctive Law is
<br />
necessary. The inductive operates using only a statistical average as
<br />
its major premiss. Such a law ignores and therefore, permits the
<br />
existence of, deviation. All that inductive signs can do, is talk
<br />
about 'current norms'. They cannot imagine change.
<br />
<p>Abduction, however, is one where the communal Law, that Major Premiss,
<br />
emerges, is actually constructed within the sign system itself. That
<br />
is, this process acknowledges the freedom of new laws and therefore,
<br />
new interactions of matter with matter. The most 'abductive' or free
<br />
realm, is, of course, the social realm.
<br />
<p>As for Pedro's comment on 'how do the media fabricate 'news'. - well,
<br />
I have a problem with that. First, I'm among the crowd who don't like
<br />
McLuhan and found his 'medium is the message' a superficial and false
<br />
statement. After all, it implies several things: (1) that the
<br />
'message' exists as a closed inviolate entity which Should Not be
<br />
changed.  (2) This cuts up the triadic sign into two parts: content
<br />
and conveyance or relations. I say that such a deconstruction into two
<br />
parts is only possible analytically but never in reality. The McLuhan
<br />
idea of a message is extremely mechanical; his writings were to try to
<br />
say that meaning doesn't operate in a mechanical manner. BUT - he
<br />
still set up his analysis in a mechanical framework of a dyad: content
<br />
and conveyance. And, using this dyad, he then tried to tell us that
<br />
the conveyance agent could be a Top Gun, as I call it, an intentional
<br />
force that degenerated the Truth of the Message.  I simply disagree
<br />
with his analytic frame and its inevitable Top Gun result.
<br />
<p>The Sign does not exist as an isolate 'thing' being moved along a
<br />
conveyor belt. The Sign only exists as interactional, whether it is a
<br />
chemical molecule, a biological cell or a mental concept. Think about
<br />
the people watching an accident. There is no 'mass media' involved; no
<br />
idea of a Top Gun authority to mould and change The Truth. But, each
<br />
individual watching that accident will have a different perception of
<br />
'what happened'. And, give them ten minutes, and that perception will
<br />
change; another ten minutes and the perception will then solidify and
<br />
become The Absolute Truth. Media don't fabricate news any more than
<br />
individuals 'fabricate' news.
<br />
<p>It's been fun to watch the news about the recent 'assassination
<br />
attempt' against Chirac. Canadian news moved from mentioning that a
<br />
Canadian was among those who wrestled the individual to the ground, to
<br />
&quot;Canadian foils assassination of Chirac'. Interviews with the
<br />
individual involved, moved from his first statements that he saw a
<br />
rifle being removed from a guitar case, and saw others attack the
<br />
individual, and his own action of grabbing hold of the bottom of the
<br />
rifle, to his being much more involved and, importantly, to the firing
<br />
of the rifle being more poised, more potentially successful, more
<br />
caring of aim - than the first accounts which suggested haphazardness.
<br />
None of this has anything to do with 'media', but with the ongoing
<br />
sign-process of interpretation, re-interpretation, becoming more
<br />
specific, more 'crisp' all the time, weeding out data which doesn't
<br />
fit into this crisp final interpretation (which data might be valid,
<br />
however)...etc.
