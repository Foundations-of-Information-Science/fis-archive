&nbsp;Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From Ray's original questions about biological information, the
<br />
appreciation of cellular information processing (or, more generally,
<br />
biological information processing) as being not just about 'computation,'
<br />
seems to me to be crucial. The notion of information as an integral part
<br />
of the dynamics of the processes using it, that I briefly referred to
<br />
earlier in the context of physics and information, seems to be especially
<br />
relevant to biological information processing. In particular, it hints to
<br />
an answer to the above question as it suggests that biological information
<br />
processing shares with the functions it supports the processes that
<br />
underlie such functions. Protein synthesis, for example, is a biochemical
<br />
process that has a strong information processing content that includes
<br />
what we interpret as reading the genetic code. In this sense, biological
<br />
information processing is not just 'computation,' but it is closely
<br />
related to it.   
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Since information processing occurs at various levels of biological
<br />
organization, viewing information processing as an integral part of
<br />
function brings Werner's statement: &quot;I think the real problem is how one
<br />
of those forms of information can be converted into the other,&quot; into the
<br />
picture. It also relates to the problem stated by Jerry of how to define
<br />
the interrelationships between structures of different degrees of
<br />
organization. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;A view, or framework, that I use to explore the notion of information as
<br />
an integral part of function takes the processes at lower levels of
<br />
organization as the infrastructure of information processing at higher
<br />
levels. Biological information processing, for example, uses physical and
<br />
macromolecular processes as part of this infrastructure. It however, uses
<br />
additional forms, or structures, with theur associated dynamics, or 
<br />
processes, in order to support higher levels of function at the cell,
<br />
organism, population, and community levels. More details of this view can
<br />
be found in two recent articles, The one in World Futures for FIS96, and
<br />
another one that will appear in BioSystems.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Like Werner Ebeling, I also like Michael Conrad's views on matters of
<br />
biological information. The percolation networks framework, in particular,
<br />
helps tackling the problem of relating different levels of information and
<br />
information processing to each other. This framework considers three main
<br />
scales of biological information processing in which specific effects
<br />
precolate upwards and downwards between these scales. The quantum speed up
<br />
effect, for example, percolates from the microscale (subatomic and atomi
<br />
level) to the mesoscale, the level of macromolecules. Macromolecules then
<br />
add plasticity, specificity and adaptability to information processing.
<br />
This new effect percolates to the macroscale, where the interaction with
<br />
the environment takes place.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;I think that the percolation networks framework clarifies some important
<br />
aspects of the view of information as an integral part of function,
<br />
helps relate computation to biological processes (including social and
<br />
organizational processes), and further clarifies the relationship between
<br />
information and function. The view of information as an integral part of
<br />
function also sheds light into the nature of the mapping functions between
<br />
levels of organization mentioned by Jerry.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;I personally think that the nature of the mapping of a level in which
<br />
some kind of symbolic information processing first becomes apparent, to
<br />
its immediately lower level, is crucial to a unified view of information.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Roberto
