<p>
As far as the outside world is concerned, the philosophy of science began 
<br />
with Popper and Hempel and ended with Kuhn.  But there is one important 
<br />
exception.  In the mid 1800s, William Whewell wrote extensively on the 
<br />
history and philosophy of science, and his writings were well known to 
<br />
scientific greats such as Charles Darwin and James Clerk Maxwell.  In my 
<br />
opinion, Whewell's ideas lie at the heart of the very best general accounts 
<br />
of science that exists today.  Whewell's views are especially relevant to 
<br />
this discussion, because he coined the term 'consilience' (as well as the 
<br />
word 'scientist').
<br />
<p><p><p>Whewell distinguishes four tests of scientific hypotheses.  By 'instances' 
<br />
he is referring to empirical data that can be fitted to the hypothesis in 
<br />
question:
<br />
<p><p><p>(1)   The Prediction of Tried Instances (used in the construction of the 
<br />
hypothesis).
<br />
<p>(2)   The Prediction of Untried Instances;
<br />
<p>(3)   The Consilience of Inductions; and
<br />
<p>(4)   The Convergence of a Theory towards Simplicity and Unity.
<br />
<p><p><p>For Whewell, 'induction' refers to the process of applying or constructing a 
<br />
scientific hypothesis to explain some empirical phenomenon.  For example, 
<br />
Newton explained the motion of a terrestrial projectiles in terms of 
<br />
gravity, and he also explained the moon's motion in terms of gravity.  These 
<br />
are two different phenomena and their explanations can be seen as two 
<br />
difference inductions.  Whewell often used the term 'colligation of facts' 
<br />
in place of 'induction'.  A consilience of inductions occurs when two, or 
<br />
more, colligations of facts are successfully unified in some way.  Newton's 
<br />
theory of gravity applied the same form of equation to celestial and 
<br />
terrestrial motions (the inverse square law), and in the case of the moon 
<br />
and the apple, both colligations of facts made use of the same adjustable 
<br />
parameter (the earth's mass).  Consequently, the moon's motion and an apple's 
<br />
motion provide independent measurements of the earth's mass, and the 
<br />
agreement of these independent measurements was an important test of Newton's 
<br />
hypothesis.  This test is more than a prediction of tried or untried 
<br />
instances (tests (1) and (2)).  It leads to the prediction of facts of a 
<br />
different kind (facts about celestial bodies from facts about terrestrial 
<br />
bodies, and so forth).
<br />
<p><p><p>The consilience of inductions is accompanied by a convergence towards 
<br />
simplicity and unity because unified theories forge connections between 
<br />
disparate phenomena, and these connections may be tested empirically. 
<br />
Simplicity and unity are necessary conditions for the consilience of 
<br />
inductions, but not sufficient.  A theory like 'everything is equal to 
<br />
everything else' is highly unified, but not consilient.  As Einstein once 
<br />
said, science should be simple, but not too simple.
<br />
<p><p><p>In the Novum Organon Renovatum, Whewell (1858) speaks of the consilience of 
<br />
inductions in the following terms:
<br />
<p><p><p>We have here spoken of the prediction of facts of the same kind as those 
<br />
from which our rule was collected [tests (1) and (2)]. But the evidence in 
<br />
favour of our induction is of a much higher and more forcible character when 
<br />
it enables us to explain and determine cases of a kind different from those 
<br />
which were contemplated in the formation of our hypothesis. The instances in 
<br />
which this has occurred, indeed, impress us with a conviction that the truth 
<br />
of our hypothesis is certain. No accident could give rise to such an 
<br />
extraordinary coincidence. No false supposition could, after being adjusted 
<br />
to one class of phenomena, exactly represent a different class, where the 
<br />
agreement was unforeseen and uncontemplated. That rules springing from 
<br />
remote and unconnected quarters should thus leap to the same point, can only 
<br />
arise from that being the point where truth resides.
<br />
<p>Accordingly the cases in which inductions from classes of facts altogether 
<br />
different have thus jumped together, belong only to the best established 
<br />
theories which the history of science contains. And as I shall have occasion 
<br />
to refer to this peculiar feature of their evidence, I will take the liberty 
<br />
of describing it by a particular phrase; and will term it the Consilience of 
<br />
Inductions.    (Quoted from p. 153 in Butts, Robert E. (ed.) (1989). William 
<br />
Whewell: Theory of Scientific Method. Hackett Publishing Company, 
<br />
Indianapolis/Cambridge.)
<br />
<p><p><p>Contemporary philosophers of science (including Popper, Hempel, and Kuhn) 
<br />
have failed to place any special emphasis on the consilience of inductions 
<br />
for the confirmation, verification, or corroboration of scientific theories, 
<br />
partly because they have not been able to understand it within their 
<br />
framework.  (So much the worse for their framework.)
<br />
<p><p><p>Here are three questions that might be discussed:
<br />
<p><p><p>(1)  Is the consilience of inductions a clear notion?  What does it mean for 
<br />
facts to be of a different kind?   Why is this especially significant?
<br />
<p><p><p>(2)  Do examples of consilience occur in sciences outside of physics?  One 
<br />
might think not because disparate phenomena are never, or very rarely, 
<br />
successfully unified by theories outside of physics.  This may be true to 
<br />
some extent, but it does seem that Darwin, for example, postulated 
<br />
connections between disparate phenomena that were previously unforeseen and 
<br />
uncontemplated.
<br />
<p><p><p>(3)  Is Whewell right to claim that the consilience of inductions belong 
<br />
only to the best established theories that the history of science contains? 
<br />
Does the consilience of inductions always point to the truth, as Whewell 
<br />
claims?  Or does it point to something else?
