<br />
<p>[Bob, on analogies bio - soc]
<br />
&nbsp;I suspect there are qualitatively different things going on but that the
<br />
processes follow similar patterns.  If, e.g., we could try to track some
<br />
parallel between how experience is recorded and stored in social structures
<br />
and biological organisms we might be able to trace the qualitative changes
<br />
arising from membership in social systems.
<br />
<p>[Stockinger]
<br />
Yes, also in my opinion interchange bio - soc is fruitful, as e.g. ongoing
<br />
discussion about &quot;fitness&quot; already shows. Personally I learned a lot from
<br />
genetics (molecular biology). As we know, genetics has been the first
<br />
applied sciences area using the notion &quot;information&quot; (contained in DNS) to
<br />
devellop its evolutionary paradigm. We know that at this genotype level
<br />
information is stored and recorded in triplets using 4 bases (G,T,C,A ? if
<br />
i remind correctly), where always two of them (G-T, C-A(?)) are combined on
<br />
both sides of the replication string. This information is &quot;read&quot; when
<br />
replication occurs. There are also special sequences which indicate the
<br />
beginning and the termination of the information-replication process.
<br />
I think that an analogy with soc-processes can be done at that level by
<br />
&quot;comparing&quot; bio-genetic information codes to (on the soc side) letters or
<br />
words and biogenetic-sequences to sentences or statements about social
<br />
values etc.
<br />
By doing so, we could get close to a socio-genetics approach, that is to
<br />
explain emergence and reproduction of social facts.
<br />
Further on one may continue the analogy by introducing the bioterm
<br />
&quot;mutation&quot; (linked to all that &quot;selection  of the fittest&quot; stuff), and
<br />
create a social change theorem where, similary to the bio-level, changes in
<br />
information-code (due to environmental, casual or internal fluctuations)
<br />
lead to variety and new value-landscapes selected.
<br />
<p>[Bob, previous]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I would still want to concentrate on SOCIAL SYSTEMS ....
</em><br />
We could work out more precisely how this happens from better understood
<br />
biological etc models.  You guys need to do that.  But the point would be
<br />
to look for ways to understand how Pedro*s *translation or ...
<br />
reverberation of biological fitness* works.  I would expect there to be a
<br />
rather large, symmetry-breaking discontinuity between propensities
<br />
generated biologically and actions chosen morally.
<br />
...I would bet you cannot find any way to deduce VEMs from genetic
<br />
concerns.  &lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
As I see it, Pedro does not apply e.g. &quot;biological fitness&quot; to influence
<br />
the sociological one, or to deduce social values from biogenetic aspects.
<br />
That would be the old discussion of how human behaviour is bio-genetically
<br />
determined etc. Thats not the question here: we are talking about
<br />
&quot;methodological&quot; analogies. We may  not be deducing VEMs from bio-genetic
<br />
material, but we may look at VEMs like socio-genetic material (social
<br />
information) which provides social structures and changes it.
<br />
<p><p>[Bob, prev.]
<br />
That is because what VEMs map is not just what individuals do but what
<br />
individual choices and actions MEAN.
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
Thats it, its the meaning that matters. Well, the meaning is sequenced in
<br />
time and structure (sequences in bio, sentences and statements in soc). And
<br />
(different from psy issues), we dont go on the individual level, but deal
<br />
with collective actions and choices. Social complexity starts here.
<br />
<p><p>[Bob, prev.]
<br />
&nbsp;VEMs perform tasks in this realm comparable to DNA in biology*they enable
<br />
societies to replicate by catalyzing the behaviors characteristic of Social
<br />
Roles, which are the non-material elements constituting social
<br />
organizations.  &lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
I think this analogy (DNA - Social Roles) is not quite correct. DNA is a
<br />
genotype matter, Social Roles would be (in comparison) phenotype matter.
<br />
So, correspondence with DNA on social level should be the information codes
<br />
contained in Social Roles, while Social Roles should be compared on
<br />
bio-level with organic (adult) structures.
<br />
<p>[Bob, p.]
<br />
To be sure, biological givens play a part in ratcheting the potential for
<br />
cooperative action upward.  But I suspect that there is an even more
<br />
dramatic change once a social system self-organizes than Pedro suggests.
<br />
It looks to me, as if there is a new criteria introduced for fitness, as he
<br />
says.
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
Once more, I think we are not talking about biogenetic influence on social
<br />
behaviour. Of course, in social self-org is a &quot;more dramatic change&quot;, there
<br />
are new criteria of fitness (social ones), I think thats out of question
<br />
when talking about society. But the selection process may be similar, when
<br />
looking at the information-processing level. Here the role of info-science
<br />
becomes clear as an intermediator between scientific areas. On both sides,
<br />
bio and soc, we talk of information, of something that reduces uncertainty,
<br />
that selects, that generates structures and changes them etc.
<br />
I think thats really fis-stuff, to work on a common concept (not to reduce
<br />
one to the other).
<br />
<p>[Bob, prev.]
<br />
But these more complex social systems would take time to evolve, and their
<br />
first systems for storing ordering information would probably not be VEMs.
<br />
I think the anthropologists are right*it was rituals and rites which first
<br />
stored information about successful collective efforts.  &lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
I would agree when viewing social &quot;phenotype&quot;-like structures. But on the
<br />
social genotype-like structures all we can look at are
<br />
communication-processes that lead to rites and furher on to values etc.
<br />
Is it possible that we keep this two levels (geno - pheno) at the social
<br />
levels: social events emerging by communications processes (&quot;conceiving&quot; or
<br />
&quot;growing&quot; social structure, geno) - and - social events realized within
<br />
roles, rites etc (mature social structure, pheno)?
<br />
<p>[Bob, prev.]
<br />
Suggesting that some societies are more complex than others will, I know,
<br />
open the door to accusations of Political Incorrectness and complaints that
<br />
Comtean positivism is being restored.  But unless everything is the same
<br />
and nothing happens in history, I think we need to recognize that degrees
<br />
of complexity exist between societies.  I also think that as the complexity
<br />
of social systems increases the information storage capacity of its symbol
<br />
systems must increase, as well.&lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
Indeed we would get problems with discrimination acts and other
<br />
accusations. But thats not the only hazzle. I think we dont win anything by
<br />
creating a scale of complexity, more or less, from simple to complex etc.
<br />
Because: in non-linear systems, simplification also may leed to an
<br />
evolutionary step, to an increase of information storage. E.g., when
<br />
computers where introduced, it was seen as a complexification of society
<br />
etc. Now, that the problem is already a routine, computers have simplified
<br />
a lot of social interchange.
<br />
Rather than speaking about different complexity-levels, we should look at
<br />
the different ways to handle complexity, was to deal with it. (But thats
<br />
just an hipothesis up to now).
<br />
<p>[Bob, prev.]
<br />
We should not want to reduce social information to biology but we do want
<br />
to test the value of analogies/homologies in social applications.  Can
<br />
those better equipped to lay out some of the biology do that, allowing the
<br />
rest of us to then flounder foolishly about reaching and straining for
<br />
parallels?  This way we could get an interdisciplinary attack on the
<br />
fundamentals of information science because we can trace parallels between
<br />
fields.&lt;
<br />
<p>[St]
<br />
Yes, I thing thats the same I meant above. Not reduction, but analogue
<br />
application.
<br />

<br />
