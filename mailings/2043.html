                <p>
                <p>My own research - into the nature of systems forming and emergence -
                    <br />
                    posits from observations that a fundamental property of each and all
                    <br />
                    tier(s) of existence includes a present and continuous relationship
                    <br />
                    between potential and enactable performances. This relationship is
                    <br />
                    primordial in the structure/function capacities of spacetime, and
                    <br />
                    instantiate throughout all subsequent formats, forms and qualia
                    <br />
                    that follow from them. And indeed the dynamic performances of
                    <br />
                    inter -and- intra tier activities engage with these considerations
                    <br />
                    included ... so there is a significant plural compounding of
                    <br />
                    semiotic relevancies - at all times.
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;Degrees of freedom&quot; are not static computational factors to help
                    <br />
                    us understand - in snap-shot fashion - the 'state or states' of
                    <br />
                    given systems under observation or evaluation. Rather, they are
                    <br />
                    intrinsic utile resources - endemic and active in all ongoing
                    <br />
                    processes. They are the 'opportunity spaces' that systems
                    <br />
                    draw from -and- can alternatively cross-access and shift
                    <br />
                    performances through, since the semiotic values of all tiers
                    <br />
                    and relations come into play, with accessibility allowing changes
                    <br />
                    in actions, policies, coordinations and goals.
                    <br />
                <p>Absolute 'free will' is - in its extreme - .. chaos. But dynamically
                    <br />
                    coordinated - and ever improving - free will, IS the operational
                    <br />
                    hunger of existence and existential forms.
                    <br />
                <p>Surviving, enduring, prevailing .. are intrinsically improved when
                    <br />
                    the actionable performance space is larger for one system over another
                    <br />
                    (all other factors being equal) .. when the opportunity for 'actions
                    <br />
                    enhancing continuation of &quot;being able to act&quot;' are larger for any
                    <br />
                    given condition/situation set. WITH THE CAVEAT, that step-wise
                    <br />
                    evaluations must be seen in larger contexts and alternative options.
                    <br />
                <p>In other words, there is a non-commutative bias at play .. not just
                    <br />
                    the number of options available or semiotic choices .. but the
                    <br />
                    sequence of choices as well. Which fits well with the Bateson criteria:
                    <br />
                    any includable difference is an important and viable and potentially
                    <br />
                    crucial point of information-worth-choosing (datum making a difference).
                    <br />
                <p>The meaning and choice space of economic (and thereafter: cultural)
                    <br />
                    decisions is enhanced when interdependency improves - and when
                    <br />
                    conditionally balanced against regional viabilities.
                    <br />
                <p>The health and vitality of the parts is as crucial as the whole.
                    <br />
                <p>Even - and especially - when the resources are limited. :-)
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Healthy systems function best when they can draw from or create
                    <br />
                    'wealth centers' .. but over-accretion and over centralization of
                    <br />
                    wealth can jeopardize broader systemic health, because the option
                    <br />
                    actions of the extremities are diminished if not continually
                    <br />
                    bathed in a wash of local options ('cash money', for example),
                    <br />
                    and the semiotic valuable viable local application possibilities
                    <br />
                    that succor and support local survival.
