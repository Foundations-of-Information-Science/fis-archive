Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>As Pedro noted, existing approach for description of molecular recognition
<br />
phenomena basically goes for the classic views. The &quot;key-lock&quot; model
<br />
continues in development of more sophisticated views, but actually they are
<br />
similar to this initial model. Analysing the basis of biomolecular
<br />
specificity and affinity, we ultimately come to the quantum picture. What we
<br />
need is to show that quantum approach can give some unexpected understanding
<br />
that is absent in the classical approach. Here I will try to outline some
<br />
moments.
<br />
<p>The duration of the elementary action of the chemical reaction is somewhat
<br />
between ten to minus 15 or minus 12 seconds. During enzymatic catalysis,
<br />
this is the time of initial interaction but the whole process is slower by
<br />
10-15 orders of magnitude and may take seconds (for slow enzymes). The order
<br />
of magnitude between the duration of human life and the time from Big Bang
<br />
is only 8. We usually say that biomolecules increase the rates of reactions
<br />
but they operate slowly. Really they make possible the routes that much less
<br />
probable without them are realize them with high precision. And they pay for
<br />
this precision by slow turnovers. We see that recognition organizes time
<br />
scale.
<br />
<p>What enzymes are fast and what are slow? Fast enzymes catalyse reactions in
<br />
microseconds (e.g. carbonic anhydrase, catalase) while slow enzymes - in
<br />
seconds. If we look at the reactions, we will see that fast enzymes catalyse
<br />
steps that easily occur in the absence of catalyst, while slow enzymes
<br />
catalyse very complex steps that are almost not probable in the nature.
<br />
According to Pedro, enzymes are molecular automata and it is true that they
<br />
are quantum automata. They actually select states (or better to say -
<br />
routes) from the set of possible alternative realizations at the quantum
<br />
level.
<br />
<p>I think that for quantum approach in understanding molecular recognition,
<br />
some proteins catching bosons (photons) and responding by fermions circuits
<br />
(electron-proton separation) can be useful. E.g. for bacteriorodopsin the
<br />
duration of each step of its conformational movement is precisely
<br />
determined, and some steps differ drastically in time. Enzyme should also
<br />
exchange  bosons with substrate molecules. The time of measurement includes
<br />
holding of coherent event during measurement, thus dissipation of energy is
<br />
minimal. This is the reason for stability and reliability of living process
<br />
in macroscopic time. Internal circuits and oscillations within measuring
<br />
device are predicted by quantum measurement model of Braginsky (references
<br />
in my papers below) and in recent developments of quantum computation
<br />
models. The uncertainty between measurement of energy of the system and time
<br />
of its observation is expressed via Heisenberg's energy-time uncertainty
<br />
ratio and increasing time of measurement decreases uncertainty in energy
<br />
that means definitiveness of selection of a certain route. Actual time of
<br />
measurement corresponds to (selectively valid) equilibration between
<br />
reliability and flexibility of the system in its surrounding.    
<br />
<p>I started to develop this approach (which arises to ideas of Howard Pattee,
<br />
Robert Rosen and Michael Conrad) in my paper in BioSystems in 1993 (or from
<br />
1985 in papers in Russian). You can find details in:
<br />
<p>Igamberdiev AU (1993) Quantum mechanical properties of biosystems - a
<br />
framework for complexity, structural stability, and transformations.
<br />
BioSystems 31 (1): 65-73 
<br />
<p>Igamberdiev AU (1999) Foundations of metabolic organization: coherence as a
<br />
basis of computational properties in metabolic networks. BioSystems 50 (1):
<br />
1-16  
<br />
<p>Another example for quantum model is the model of coherence in microtubules
<br />
of Hameroff and Penrose for explanation of conscious events. It may
<br />
represent a particular case of quantum non-demolition model for molecular
<br />
recognitions. It substantiates parallelism of metal and physical events,
<br />
which is definitely absent in the classical models of brain operation. The
<br />
coherence in microtubules should be the same phenomenon as the coherence
<br />
during conformational relaxation of enzymes. 
<br />
<p>I think what is needed is working out strong physical models underlying
<br />
quantum recognition process for molecular interactions and catalysis. This
<br />
may correspond to the development of quantum computation paradigm and its
<br />
application to living systems. I am sure that necessary background for this
<br />
is already present in modern science. Among many things it will explain:
<br />
<p>- duration times of conformational processes 
<br />
- stability and transformations of metabolic networks
<br />
- brain operation
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
Andrei Igamberdiev
