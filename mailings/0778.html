Rafael, 
<br />
<p>You replied to Chistoph
<br />
<p>&lt;yes, but the difference does not just come from the progammer, 
<br />
&lt;it comes basically from the kind of being
<br />
&lt;a robot is (in case it is not a *flesh* one... at least...
<br />
<p>I empathise with you here. Although if I were flying a plane I'd
<br />
rather receive my meaningful information from a computerised autopilot
<br />
than a fleshly comatose copilot.
<br />
<p>Can an autopilot (or a thermostat, a digital TV or a chess program 
<br />
like Brute Force)have a meaningful informational experience? 
<br />
<p>The Posthumanists would probably say 'yes' - and a qualitatively better one 
<br />
than us non-cyborgs and human chess players. They seem to be somewhere between 
<br />
Kubrick's 'Hal' and Spielberg's 'David'.
<br />
<p>I tend to agree with Jerry in questioning &quot;that &quot;information&quot; is tightly coupled to 
<br />
human values and utilitarian patterns of belief.&quot; 
<br />
<p>Are Liberal Humanists becoming 'human all too human' about 'embodi-ment'
<br />
&nbsp;'be-ing' and 'mean-ing'? 
<br />
<p>Aren't we mistaken in treating such concepts as steady states rather than 
<br />
continuous entities? Paper(as Bohm pointed out) is in its quantum potential 
<br />
form 'paper-ing'. Just as language is really languag-ing and meaning is mean-ing.*
<br />
(to paraphrase Nietzsche - 'Jedes Wort ist ein Abgrund')
<br />
<p>Sense (Christoph's 'web of meaning') emerges out of our interaction
<br />
(being-in-the-world) with other 'beings' and with 'things' like computers, 
<br />
faxes, robots et al. It is somehow embedded in the ecology of living interaction.
<br />
<p>To talk about 'information' carrying or transferring meaning (or vice versa)
<br />
is in my view myopic and takes into account only passive information - incidents
<br />
and artefacts rather than that active force Jerry alludes to in his Wordsworth quote.
<br />
This is where the technology school of Knowledge Management has gone so horribly wrong. 
<br />
N'est-ce-pas?
<br />
<p>The choice is really between 'informational pattern' and 'embodied enaction'
<br />
not between fleshly beings and digital 'things.' Do you agree with that?
<br />
<p>I think the debate goes to the heart of Michael Conrad's theories and
<br />
the belief in a synergy between natural and computational phenomena.
<br />
The jury is still out on that. 
<br />
<p>John H.
<br />
<p>*&quot;A noun is just a &quot;slow&quot; verb; that is, it refers to a process that is 
<br />
progressing so slowly as to appear static. For example, the paper on 
<br />
which this text is printed appears to have a stable existence, but 
<br />
we know that it is, at all times including this very moment, changing 
<br />
and evolving toward dust. Hence paper would more accurately be called 
<br />
papering-to emphasize that it is always and inevitably a dynamic process 
<br />
undergoing perpetual change.&quot;

<br />
<p><p>I am not sure if we are thinking in the
<br />
same direction
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rafael,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You higlight a good point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Overall answer: yes the presence of water will generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a meaningful information for you and for the robot. 
</em><br />
<p>well only in case the robot is of the kind of being
<br />
that can *experience* (in its own body...) thirst
<br />
(not just to have been *programmed* to *answer*
<br />
'Yes, I am thirsty' when it perceives water...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But beyond this statement, many things will be different. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presence of water is the external information that you, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thirsty human, receive. And this received information will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate a meaning in your body because it has some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation with your constraint &quot;maintain a given level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water in the body&quot;. And the meaningful information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated will be &quot;presence of water that can reduce my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thirst&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the robot, assuming it has been programmed with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraint &quot;drink some water&quot;, the presence of water will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate a meaningful information &quot;presence of water that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can satisfy the constraint&quot;.
</em><br />
<p>this is the point where I do not agree: to have been 
<br />
programmed is not the same as to *feel* the need
<br />
for water based on bodily constraints... (this is *just*
<br />
a formal similarity). This is the reason, I believe, why
<br />
the *top down* idea of making robots *think* (GPS and
<br />
the like) is *wrong* i.e. it will remain *forever* abstract.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the robot, like you, will generate internally a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information. At first look, theses two meaningful information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are quite similar. But this similarity is only for this precise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning vs this precise constraint. For the robot, it is all that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is to be said. But for us humans, the presence of water is going 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to generate many other meanings coming from the constraints 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to our history of relations with water and with the world, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to our other desires, to our emotions, to our free will, and so on. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And for us, the meaning quite similar to the one generated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within the robot will be only a little element in the web of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings that the presence of water will generate within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves.
</em><br />
<p>indeed, this is just a *similarity* , here I agree again...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This makes the difference. As you write it, a human can say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;it is related to my whole bodily being-in-the-world with others.. &quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could also add the other difference about derived vs non 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived meaning (the meaning in the robot comes from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human programing. For us, it does not).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apart from this last difference, I feel we can say that it is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a question about a difference of complexity than about a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference of nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you agree ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>yes, but the difference does not just come from the
<br />
progammer, it comes basically from the kind of being
<br />
a robot is (in case it is not a *flesh* one... at least...

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Christoph,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as far as I can see, something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has meaning for me (or for another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; kind of living system) not just if data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are *processed* in my brain but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if it is related to my whole bodily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being-in-the-world with others... I mean,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if I am thirsty it is because my body is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of this kind that it needs water. Would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it make *any difference* (i.e. any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning and therefore has any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; informational value...) if a robot that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not of the kind of bodily existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as I am, would be able to say: I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thirsty? and the same with all other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *meanings*.
