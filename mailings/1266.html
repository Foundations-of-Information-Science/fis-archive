<p>
Dear Rafael and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Many thanks for the philosophical reflections on meaning. Probably the vast 
<br />
'opennes' about the concept that you have described is related to the 
<br />
backwardness (or extreme complexity?) of the neurosciences' fields and the 
<br />
relative lack of connection among them. We are still missing a central arch 
<br />
or theory on human (or mammal, for that matter) &quot;informational&quot; and 
<br />
cognitive processing integration. It is not just a personal remark, rather 
<br />
it comes from leading neuroscientists such as Edelman, Arbib ('a theory of 
<br />
the person' missing for the latter), Crick, and others.
<br />
<p>I would add only a little to the points on the 'sociality' and 'porosity' 
<br />
behind the meaning of our symbolic concepts: just that something similar 
<br />
seems to happen when one tries to identify the 'meaning' of a biological 
<br />
'signal' at the cellular level. A defeating networking of molecular, 
<br />
ontogenetic, and evolutionary occurrences appears. Thus, one is tempted to 
<br />
get throughout the autopoietic road and deny the problem (both of 
<br />
information and meaning) by 'bringing forth' an emergent world. But I think 
<br />
it is better to persist step-by-step along the molecular.biological 
<br />
approach. Actually this is a great problem, shared (though in a little 
<br />
twisted way) with the contemporary discussions on 'systems biology' from 
<br />
the recently framed bioinformatic turfs of genomics, proteomics, 
<br />
transcriptomis, and metabolomics (Viktoras was somehow connecting with this 
<br />
biomolecular approach too, introducing 'purpose' and 'function' to talk 
<br />
about meaning).
<br />
<p>In my opinion, the challenge is to go directly from molecular recognition 
<br />
to cellular meaning (perhaps abduction would appear somewhere in the 
<br />
middle, directly by itself) without introducing from the outside helping 
<br />
concepts that smuggle a surrogate solution, or a whole ad hoc doctrine. 
<br />
Maybe biosemioticians will not share this direct quest for the molecular 
<br />
'informational mechanisms' producing meaning out from received signals--or 
<br />
they will. The idea is not to reject reductionism, but to complement it 
<br />
with an interesting 'integrationist' approach.
<br />
<p>Also, Koichiro has intriguingly connected this problem with the complexity 
<br />
and networking underlying economic self-production. I would add that 
<br />
economic autopoiesis, like cellular one, necessarily needs consideration of 
<br />
those events that contribute negatively too (about those elements which 
<br />
degrade, either by themselves or forcedly). Otherwise, the economic 
<br />
self-actualization would be condemned to  the eternal load of backwarded 
<br />
agents (e.g., menhir builders would be thriving around happily). Actually, 
<br />
in European countries we have this sort of problems quite often, about 
<br />
backward enterprises the members of which do not easily accept the 
<br />
actualization conveyed by the 'meaning' out from the economic 'signals'...
<br />
<p>Seemingly, this line of thinking would imply that meaning has a 'ecumenic' 
<br />
reach throughout most of the informational realms. So, not only behind our 
<br />
symbolic language. ¿?
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
