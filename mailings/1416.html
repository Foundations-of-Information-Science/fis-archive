Dear FIS colleagues,

<p>My position is that physics is all there is in the universe, and I 
<br />
reject appeals to metaphysics as maneuvers to imply the existence of 
<br />
unobservable black boxes where causation occurs so as to support one's 
<br />
preconceived notions.  I am curious whether the claim above represents 
<br />
the view that (human) information is metaphysical, or that it doesn't 
<br />
really exist at all.  The latter might suggest that the notion of 
<br />
information is merely a human construct that we use as a heuristic 
<br />
device.
<br />
<p>To help clarify the paragraph above, consider the proposition that 
<br />
&quot;ideas&quot;, memories, mental images, ..., may exist as physical patterns 
<br />
of neural connections in our brains.  In other words, these phenomena, 
<br />
which we often consider information residing in our minds, might exist 
<br />
only because they are physical.  I find the notion that all information 
<br />
exists in physical form, and that there is no &quot;disembodied&quot; 
<br />
information, appealing.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One can't prove anything by using metaphors.

</em><br />
<p>I agree (certainly with the last bit).  This comment, however, inspires 
<br />
me to describe an interesting little study on information and metaphor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A molecular evolutionary biologist, Jody Hey, did an interesting study 
<br />
of the way scientists describe fuzzy vs. crisp objects while he was on 
<br />
sabbatical a few years ago.  He used this as a way to better understand 
<br />
how biologists deal with biological species, which are inherently fuzzy 
<br />
objects.  I should say up front that my interpretation of his results 
<br />
are quite different from Jody's.  He sent emails to the biologists 
<br />
represented in his list of email addresses (including me) along with an 
<br />
attached image.  In the email he asked his colleagues to describe their 
<br />
image as clearly as possible.  The goal should be to maximize the 
<br />
chance that another biologist could accurately draw the image based 
<br />
only on reading the description.  Half of his subjects received a crisp 
<br />
image of three white geometric shapes on a black background.  As I 
<br />
recall, the shapes were a triangle, a square and an ellipse, which 
<br />
varied somewhat in size and orientation.  These shapes were more or 
<br />
less randomly located in the three dimensional space.  The other half 
<br />
of his subjects received a very fuzzy version of the same image.  This 
<br />
is the one I received.  You could not discern any approximation of 
<br />
geometric shapes; instead some parts of the space had a greater density 
<br />
of white pixels than other parts, and white and black pixels were mixed 
<br />
in most regions.  The centers of the places where crisp white objects 
<br />
would have been were densely white and the places furthest from any of 
<br />
those places were densely black.  The data basically showed that 
<br />
descriptions of the fuzzy images used fewer words, which Jody 
<br />
interpreted to suggest that those images had a lower information 
<br />
content (or at least that the biologists described them as if this were 
<br />
the case).  However, he noted that most descriptions of the fuzzy image 
<br />
resorted to the use of metaphors, whereas the descriptions of the crisp 
<br />
image did not.  My interpretation of these results is that it would 
<br />
take MANY more words to effectively describe the fuzzy images than the 
<br />
crisp images.  Resorting to metaphor was a strategic short cut on the 
<br />
part of subjects, like myself.  I mentioned, for example, that the 
<br />
image looked like two amorphous galaxies touching each other so that it 
<br />
would be hard to assign the stars at the interface to either galaxy.  
<br />
The use of metaphor allowed me to say much more than I could otherwise 
<br />
communicate with so few words because it evoked a rich, well-formed 
<br />
image in the mind of the reader (at least that was my unconscious 
<br />
strategy).
<br />
<p>I hope this story was not too far off topic here.  To connect my point 
<br />
back to Lauri's statement, I would say that metaphors can be efficient 
<br />
communication tools and therefore useful elements in scientific 
<br />
argumentation.  I agree that they are not proofs of anything in 
<br />
isolation.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
