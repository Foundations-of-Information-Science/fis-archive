<p>
John and Edwina,
<br />
<p>I hope not to go beyond my e-mail account
<br />
with this answer...
<br />
In fact, I do not adhere to Kant but to... Heidegger
<br />
(with regard to time) and this means a very
<br />
radical questioning of transcendental idealism...
<br />
Heidegger is not far away from Bergson (he
<br />
planned a discussion of Bergson in the second
<br />
part of Being and Time) who distiguishes (against
<br />
Descartes) between the *living time* (or *durée*)
<br />
and the classical (Zeno, Aristotle) definition of
<br />
time as a quantitative dimension - both being
<br />
empirical (!). But indeed Bergson (similar to
<br />
Kant) thinks the *duree* within *conscience*
<br />
while Heidegger's *fundamental ontology* (i.e.
<br />
his conception that the temporality of human
<br />
existence 'in-the-world-with-others') is not only (!)
<br />
of the kind of a succession of identical *nows*
<br />
(as for Kant and also for Aristotle). Heidegger
<br />
was looking for a *common ground* where the
<br />
different views of time (the quantitative and the
<br />
qualitative) may be grounded *beyond* the (too
<br />
narrow) provisional (!) *fundament* provided by
<br />
the analytic of *Dasein* (which is already beyond
<br />
the limits of Kant's conscience, as it departs
<br />
from the *facticity* of our being-in-the-world...)
<br />
Heidegger's late philosophy even temporalizes
<br />
not only existential being but also being itself
<br />
in the sense of the *eventuality* of the, in
<br />
Koichiro's and Edwina's terms, of the progressive,
<br />
the present and the perfect tense (which are in
<br />
some way the three modes of time that *give*
<br />
what comes into being, including (!) human
<br />
existence (with its specific richness, as John
<br />
remarks). In this sense I do agree with you, that
<br />
within such a *theory of time* there is no possibility
<br />
of conceiving time neither as an absolute framework
<br />
not as a historical one. Nevertheless is the *clock
<br />
time* not wrong or useless and we do not need to
<br />
take an idealistic (Kantian) viewpoint (and, less than
<br />
that, a metaphysical viewpoint à la Plato...). In sum,
<br />
what I have learned from Heidegger (and others...) is
<br />
- to *weaken* the quatitative (absolute and/or
<br />
empirical) conception of (clock-) time
<br />
- this means to weaken the *metaphysics of
<br />
presence* (and the conception of time derived
<br />
from (the duration) of *precenceing* as well as
<br />
from the *limits* (or *de-finition*) of what is
<br />
present (which is Plato's intention: the permanent
<br />
limits of *ideas* make possible their *permanent*
<br />
duration in/outside time)
<br />
- to be able to see why and how our rich forms of
<br />
being-in-time are not just based on the (empirical
<br />
or transcendental) structure of my brain/subjectivity but that
<br />
they depend on the awareness of our natality and
<br />
mortality (including different ways *looking away*
<br />
of these constraints, for instance conceiving our
<br />
existence *just* in the way of *clock time*...)
<br />
- we may still, indeed, use 'clock time' for different
<br />
and very useful purposes...
<br />
<p>What follows from this with regard to information?
<br />
Well for instance that information is for us
<br />
*for a while* as we are  *for a while*,
<br />
*ephemere* as Pindar says, which means not
<br />
just *sub-ject* to time but also free to respond to
<br />
time... (and *in time*) at list for a while!
<br />
<p>cheers
<br />
Rafael

<p><p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see that we have to give up a version of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory that can serve as a sort of fixed point. One of the advantages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the relativization of space and time was the recognition that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not fundamental, but that the interval was. Likewise with matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and energy, replaced with a broader view of energy. In this case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the richer forms of information that you mention are merely shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to be fundamental. I think the problem you refer to Kant is a phoney
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one that results from placing out ideas above empirical evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kant was wrong; space and time are empirical entities. Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitions of them can be wrong and corrigible. Likewise with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, or for that matter for irreversibility. I think that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very Kantian problems arise from a false obsession with our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human perspective, and that they are bogus problems resulting from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking some of our limitations and projecting them as transcendent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an impediment to seeing things clearly, and has much in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common with parochial religion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
