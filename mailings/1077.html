Dear Pedro and other FISers,
<br />
<p>Pedro's consideration of the relationship between the two parts (most cases pair-wise)
<br />
of a molecular recognition is very important.
<br />
Their relation can be always regarded as incomplete symmetry
<br />
(We can discuss this in very detail again.)
<br />
<p>We discuss molecular recognition here because it is closely related to
<br />
information at the molecular level. Your concept - supplementarity -
<br />
might be still better considered as a kind of complementarity. Small size molecule
<br />
is supplementary to the larger one? Sometimes a metal ion,
<br />
even though the size is small, is regarded as center (or template) and a large
<br />
cyclic molecule is only regarded as a ligand.
<br />
<p>Is the molecule wrapping the other molecule
<br />
or part of the other molecule more important? Male domination is not good,
<br />
female domination may also bad. To avoid struggling for molecular &quot;rights&quot;, we may
<br />
use complementarity. If the two parts (host-guest) are of the same
<br />
rights, it can be regarded as a binary system and much easier to discuss
<br />
in terms of information theory.
<br />
<p>Which one is suplementary to the other, 0 or 1, black or white?
<br />
They are complementary in certain property and the same in many other
<br />
aspects. Man and woman are all the same (both have very similar
<br />
anatomic structure: two hands, etc., and same interests, etc.).
<br />
The only difference is the sexual organs. Spin-up and spin-down are both
<br />
tiny small magnets. The only difference is their orientations (up or down).
<br />
<p>I was in Paris in a UNESCO conference hall where the superpower USA
<br />
has the delegation seat the same size as a small country Switzerland.
<br />
UN procedures are easier if all the states are given the seat of the same size.
<br />
This might be for the same reason. Smaller country is not necessarily
<br />
a suplementary to the larger ones.
<br />

&gt; Dear Shu-Kun and colleagues,
&gt;
&gt; I have found it very elegant the content of these two messages of yours on
&gt; molecular recognition. Coincidentally I was reading Lee Smolin ('Three
&gt; roads to quantum gravity', Weidenfeld 2000) and have found that your two
&gt; laws on information/entropy were quite meaningful there, helping me to make
&gt; some sense on the abstruse thermodynamic phenomena affecting black holes.
&gt; Perhaps only metaphorically, or maybe --reminding Bea's yesterday posting
&gt; showing support for these views from the cumulative damage field-- it
&gt; happens that good physico-informational ideas make sense in a variety of
&gt; fields...
&gt;
&gt; In my own case, rather than the quantum gravity approaches of which I am
&gt; totally ignorant, these new views make a lot of sense in order to estimate
&gt; the information changes that enzymes' works introduce upon the global info
&gt; status of the cellular system. I made years ago some 'automata' models
&gt; about the enzyme work cycle, but their 'bits' were quite unclear and lacked
&gt; any systematic reference to put those minimal info changes into a global
&gt; methodological path. I talked on 'wet symmetries' and, particularly,
&gt; on  'functional voids'. Now I think that your clean formulation allows the
&gt; conceptualization of such functional voids as 'entropy outgrowths' (your
&gt; entropy of mixing--not thermodynamic entropy)... Further following this
&gt; cellular discussion would take us to the 'forbidden' abduction term, to the
&gt; life cycle organization (generative, structural, communicational info
&gt; varieties),  and to the biological versions of Michael Leyton group theory
&gt; of generative processes  --eg, the 'telescopic' role of Hox genes... But
&gt; all this speculative stuff should belong to the last (postvacational?) part
&gt; of the current molecular-biologic session.
&gt;
&gt; So I return immediately to molecular recognition. In the brute list of
&gt; recognition phenomena I presented (a list, not a rigorous taxonomy as Jerry
&gt; was enquiring--but it has some intriguing internal order, as can easily be
&gt; appreciated), the similarity &amp; complementarity casuistic does not look
&gt; enough: a substantial part of the biomolecular 'sexy' encounters would
&gt; demand a third category, I think. Rather than quenching a mutual 'desire'
&gt; of the molecular 'moieties' it would mean the literal involvement or
&gt; wrapping of one of the molecules (or a large part of it) by the other.
&gt; 'Supplementarity' is the new term I would suggest. Supplementarity implies
&gt; a molecular involvement which can be done in many ways, putting
&gt; facultatively into action a vast panoply of atomic bonds provided for
&gt; instance (in protein complexes) by a large and very variable population of
&gt; participating amino acids. But I recognize that its is just a biological
&gt; nuance derived from the quasi-universal recognition-problem-solving
&gt; capability of the living.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;...the symmetry principle: the higher the symmetry, the more stable a
&gt; system will be. Now (only now) we can consider the molecular recognition
&gt; in details because thermodynamics is actually useless for molecular
&gt; recognition consideration. &quot;
&gt;
&gt; It looks a very challenging statement. Does everybody agree with it?
&gt;
&gt; best
&gt;
&gt; Pedro
