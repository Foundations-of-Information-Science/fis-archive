Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>Following our discussion of the inadequacies of the current 
<br />
hypothesis on Cosmic Evolution on May 4, 2002, we posed a list of 
<br />
questions concerning the fundamental scientific issues  relating to 
<br />
the emergence of complexity.  During these discussions, we recognized 
<br />
that different individuals were proposing different concepts of time. 
<br />
Later, we decided to address the concept of time at the next WESSbook 
<br />
meeting, June 8, 2002.  The meeting will be begin at 12:00 PM in room 
<br />
284 of the Reiss Science Building on the Georgetown University 
<br />
Campus.  This session will be an &quot;open mike&quot; session.
<br />
<p>Volunteers are sought to give presentations on current views of this 
<br />
important metaphysical question.
<br />
<p>The session will be divided into two parts, Early and Late.
<br />
<p>Volunteers for the &quot;Early&quot; part are requested to submit a title and 
<br />
several sentences describing their hypothesis on the nature of time. 
<br />
We hope to have three of four individuals from different disciplines 
<br />
who can give substantial presentations on their views.
<br />
<p>&quot;Late&quot; speakers are invited to submit an email documenting their 
<br />
desire to comment on the views of the &quot;Early&quot; speakers or to briefly 
<br />
develop another perspective of time.
<br />
<p>Free discussion will follow the early and late speakers.
<br />
<p>In order to schedule an orderly meeting and to notify members, it is 
<br />
necessary to receive your title no later than COB, Tuesday, June 4, 
<br />
2002.
<br />
<p>We will partition the four hours democratically between the longer 
<br />
and the shorter talks.
<br />
<p>An open question:  Should we consider future WESSbook sessions on 
<br />
other fundamental issues related to the circumstances of the 
<br />
emergence of complexity, such as &quot;space&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;, and 
<br />
&quot;logic&quot;?
<br />
<p>This question is asked because WESS has been invited to present a 
<br />
session at a Symposium being organized by the Washington Academy of 
<br />
Sciences. The Washington Academy of Sciences symposium will be held 
<br />
in March, 2004.  The symposium would provide WESS members to present 
<br />
their views to a wider audience.
<br />
<p>Your comments on this proposal on the nature of time  and the 
<br />
potential for participation in the Washington Academy of Sciences 
<br />
symposium are welcomed.
<br />
<p>The volume of literature on &quot;time&quot; is huge.  If you would like 
<br />
guidance on relevant works on the nature of time relevant to this 
<br />
WESSbook meeting, please call.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
