                <p>We may ask, what is entailed by the addition of a degree of freedom? In my
                    <br />
                    just previous posting (pasted in below) I noted that the addition of
                    <br />
                    biological constraints to a chemical system, or the addition of social
                    <br />
                    contraints to a biological system, each time limits further the freedom
                    <br />
                    with which involved molecules can take up positions in spacetime with
                    <br />
                    respect to each other, by initiating strong correlations between them. As
                    <br />
                    well, increasing amounts of entropy production would be taken over by
                    <br />
                    activities involving supramolecular configurations. From the point of view
                    <br />
                    of the involved molecules, the impostion of biology and sociality amount to
                    <br />
                    increasing degrees of UNfreedom. In fact, the degrees of freedom that are
                    <br />
                    instituted by biological and social informational constraints would not
                    <br />
                    have existed, as such, in a purely physical-chemical system, and so the
                    <br />
                    molecules would have been freer to move around as individuals. I think it
                    <br />
                    is not always clearly seen that the emergence of new realms in nature
                    <br />
                    (e.g., biology, sociality) involves the imposition of MORE constraints upon
                    <br />
                    a phsical-chemical system).
                    <br />
                <p>Yes. This was basically my point when I said originally in reply to Loet
                    <br />
                    that additional levels don't open more possibilities, but constrain the
                    <br />
                    possibilities. Loet tries to distinguish in recent posts between the
                    <br />
                    model and the object. This principal applies to either, and the
                    <br />
                    distinction is irrelevant.
                    <br />
                <p>An interesting question is how we can add dimensions to a model of a
                    <br />
                    system that is justified by our knowledge of the system. We do know that
                    <br />
                    in standard physics, all possibilities are given by the phase space of
                    <br />
                    the system. That is a matter of definition, so Loet is simply violating
                    <br />
                    technical terminology in the passage quoted above. If we add dimensions
                    <br />
                    to a model without justification, it is very easy to get the appearance
                    <br />
                    of emergence without any reality to back it up.
                    <br />
                <p>A standard procedure in classical physics is to include constraints on
                    <br />
                    the system in the dimensionality of the system by using generalized
                    <br />
                    coordinates. A simple but typical case is a bead on a ring, which has
                    <br />
                    the constraint of being on the ring. So we can reduce the dimensionality
                    <br />
                    by taking a one dimensional bounded space with the spatial dimensions of
                    <br />
                    angle (and dynamic dimension of angular momentum), yielding a
                    <br />
                    two-dimensional problem. A good internalist model of a system
                    <br />
                    (endophysics) should always use the minimal generalized dimensions that
                    <br />
                    are empirically required to describe the system. That gives the best
                    <br />
                    empirically supported dimensionality of the system.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Failure to see this, I think, happens because
                    <br />
                    these emergences are often viewed as ways that the world comes to transcend
                    <br />
                    its previous limitations. I think this perspective is misleading. What
                    <br />
                    substance this viewpoint has can be appreciated when -- after instituting
                    <br />
                    new degrees of freedom -- it happens that they do NOT get fixed, but remain
                    <br />
                    as part of informational entropy instead. Now the emergent system seems
                    <br />
                    to have acquired, indeed, more degrees of freedom to play with, even though
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom have been lost at the lower levels.
                    <br />
                <p>I am unclear that degrees of freedom are lost in this case. I think that
                    <br />
                    typically the size of the space, not the number of degrees of freedom is
                    <br />
                    reduced. On the other hand, despite the loss in size, in an emergent
                    <br />
                    (non-Laplacean -- see below) system may have more dimensions, since the
                    <br />
                    new higher level order is not fully deducible from the lower, nor, as
                    <br />
                    Loet sort of noted in a previous post, can the higher level fully
                    <br />
                    control the lower level. In emergent systems there is in increase in
                    <br />
                    logical independence of the constraints on the system, and hence an
                    <br />
                    increase in dimensionality (understood as per the endophysics approach).s
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>This is to say that
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom appear as openings and opportunities only when they are
                    <br />
                    NOT fixed. To the extent that a system acquires more and more degrees of
                    <br />
                    freedom AND they also get fixed, that system gets inceasingly nailed down
                    <br />
                    by information (this information 'overload' is the basis of a strong theory
                    <br />
                    of senescence). Thus, a biological system, say, or social system, is
                    <br />
                    interesting only to the extent that its various possibilities remain
                    <br />
                    uncertain. From the point of view of molecules at lower than biological /
                    <br />
                    social levels, degrees of freedom opened by the emergence of these higher
                    <br />
                    integrative levels impose barriers to their freedom to move whether they
                    <br />
                    are fixed or not. These new degrees of freedom can create openings and
                    <br />
                    possibilities ONLY at the higher levels, after closing down possibilities
                    <br />
                    at the lower levels. With emergence, some of the possibilities of
                    <br />
                    activity by a system will have moved upscale from the molecular level.
                    <br />
                <p>Assuming this can be restated without blurring dimension in the sense of
                    <br />
                    size with dimension in terms of degree of freedom, this would be right.
                    <br />
                    That is presupposing a lot of technical work, however. I think it is
                    <br />
                    very important that we keep as clear as possible what problems have been
                    <br />
                    solved and which are still open.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this might not be quite correct. If there
                    come to be
                    <br />
                    habitual connections between certain nodes, like feedbacks in emergent
                    <br />
                    'autocatalytic' loops, the rates of reaction of such regions will become
                    <br />
                    slower than the average for the network, and if that rate is significantly
                    <br />
                    different, even a new level of scale might emerge. In the 'unevolved'
                    <br />
                    network it might be that the rates of communication between nodes would be
                    <br />
                    power law distributed, but if different rates are not allocated to certain
                    <br />
                    regions (as would be the case that I just described) but could emerge
                    <br />
                    anywhere in the network, then there would have been no emergence of a new
                    <br />
                    level.
                    <br />
                <p>I once thought that this would do, Stan, but I no longer think so. Habit
                    <br />
                    is not enough. However habits typically do form from autocatalytic
                    <br />
                    loops, and something like these are required. More so, just mechanical
                    <br />
                    loops are not enough, since these can be reduced to the component
                    <br />
                    contributions (by numerical approximation, if nothing else, so they are
                    <br />
                    amenable to a Lapalcian analysis). The cases I mentioned are not
                    <br />
                    amenable to Laplacian analysis. I think this is the correct test for
                    <br />
                    emergence, and it requires a dissipative system (or at least an
                    <br />
                    available potential energy source or sink -- we know only of the
                    <br />
                    latter). Fodor is right about connectionism. It is not sufficient. I do
                    <br />
                    not mean by sufficient necessary. Of course there are networks in which
                    <br />
                    emergence is possible. Specifically, ones that are not amenable to
                    <br />
                    Laplacian analysis.

                <p>Comment [JDC]: I think the last question should be posed in terms of
                    <br />
                    likelihood rather than in terms of possibility. The intelligent
                    <br />
                    designers (intelligent designians? intelligent designators? -- the
                    <br />
                    IDniks) argue that what we see is impossible without guidance, but they
                    <br />
                    mean highly unlikely. The possibility of self-organization increases the
                    <br />
                    likelihood of macroscopic organization and its retention, since it
                    <br />
                    presupposes cohesion (see my stuff on this very useful concept), making
                    <br />
                    the unlikely much more likely. In fact from the lower level a
                    <br />
                    non-Laplacean system will seem possible, but highly unlikely, which
                    <br />
                    IDniks exploit. And the bulk of biologists (pace Dawkins) have left
                    <br />
                    themselves open to this by not being sufficiently self-critical. The
                    <br />
                    IDniks feed off scientific arrogance. (As does Fodor, actually -- he is
                    <br />
                    a predeterminist, but hardly an IDnik, though I have never understood
                    <br />
                    where he thought meaning does originate.)
                    <br />
                <p>Enough for now. That ties up a bunch of things into a nice knot -- Fodor
                    <br />
                    and the IDniks indeed.
