                <p>
                    Thank you for you reply Andrei:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I would not like to consider fields as material structures, but as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;information structures.
                    </em><br />
                <p>AAAA: To me a structure (regardless what is the essence of it) is a model -
                    <br />
                    something imposed on human experience by a mind.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The dichomoty REAL/UNREAL -- yes!
                    </em><br />
                <p>AAAA: If I read you right I think we then are agreed then that &quot;real&quot;
                    <br />
                    depends on a consensual definition - and that it is NOT up to experimental
                    <br />
                    physics to decide in this matter. But then is also &quot;reality&quot; an outcome of a
                    <br />
                    set of social decisions - a pure belief? In case it then doesn't make sense
                    <br />
                    to say that &quot;reality&quot; (or any object at all) is pre-given to man in his acts
                    <br />
                    of observation. That is to say to proceed from the assumption that there is
                    <br />
                    a &quot;unary world given to man&quot; is highly misleading. To my mind it would be
                    <br />
                    nicer be able to show that the individual knower refers to his personal
                    <br />
                    experience (priverse) when he says &quot;universe&quot; - and he has by years of
                    <br />
                    training learnt to speak about (model) his priverse in a way that actually
                    <br />
                    refers to some common behind-lying stability - even if we cannot know
                    <br />
                    anything else but the feeling of this stability (i.e., cannot explicate this
                    <br />
                    experience by the use of concepts). In that view no &quot;information&quot; is passed
                    <br />
                    over from reality but simply rises in the mind (by his acts of
                    <br />
                    conceptualisation) of the thinker. THE BIT RISES IN THE MIND OF THE THINKER
                    <br />
                    by means of his acts of conceptualisation and can be used in communication
                    <br />
                    by other thinkers trained in a similar way of conceptualisation.
                    <br />
                <p>I also agree with Igor - but to my mind something is missing here:.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please allow me to exercise my formal &quot;Marxist&quot; education.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; The world out there does not know the word &quot;matter&quot;. Matter is
                        a primary
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical concept, our axiome that we introduce to deal (to model)
                        the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; real world. The concepts of &quot;field&quot;, &quot;particle&quot; are
                        derivatives of this
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom, and space and time are also axioms. Therefore if we go down to the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; basics, (deviating from the applied science which deals with matter
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; casually), we should always keep in mind that we may change the axioms if
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary. The world will not change, only its description.
                    </em><br />
                    AAAA: I fully agree - but you forget to tell that the axioms in use must
                    <br />
                    indubitably defined. And they are not - neither &quot;matter&quot; nor &quot;real&quot; or
                    <br />
                    &quot;information&quot;. This is so because uncertainty of definition causes
                    <br />
                    uncertainty of meaning and language. The point of my asking the question was
                    <br />
                    to show that the eventual definitions (that we are lacking of today) must be
                    <br />
                    based on scientific consensus, which these FIS-discussions clearly shows.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The world out there does not know the word &quot;matter&quot;.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The world will not change, only its description.
                    </em><br />
                    AAAA: See how easy a slip of the tounge can accidentally set the stage of
                    <br />
                    the
                    <br />
                    discussion - use of the conception of a &quot;unary world&quot; at the same time
                    <br />
                    proposes the use of a
                    <br />
                    realist language. In the subject-oriented approach there are as many worlds
                    <br />
                    (priverses) as there are living beings - so confusion easily occurs..
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the ways to do so is to introduce information as a primary
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; category, which therefore needs no explanation or proof.
                    </em><br />
                    AAAA: Of course even a primary category needs of an explanation - we need an
                    <br />
                    explanation how of how we should use the term so introduced.(its doesn't
                    <br />
                    explain the &quot;reality&quot; but on the other hand the model terms we use.) In
                    <br />
                    order to answer a
                    <br />
                    question like &quot;Is X an real?&quot; we need an explicit definition of real --- or
                    <br />
                    when asking &quot;Is
                    <br />
                    Q information?&quot; we need an explicit definition of information - otherwise
                    <br />
                    these questions are clearly undecidable - and unscientific - and can be the
                    <br />
                    subject of debate for ever.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we think a bit, any interaction is in fact exchange of information.
                    </em><br />
                    AAAA: Quite right - but the reality is not an actor engaged in acts of
                    <br />
                    information
                    <br />
                    exchange. See my reply to Andrei above
