                <p>
                    Dear John and all,
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>please let me walk around the idea of ethos as a predictable pattern of
                    <br />
                    decisions among two alternatives which cannot be reconciled with each other.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;ethos&quot; has as its basic meaning &quot;home&quot;, the place - and customs - of one's
                    <br />
                    upbringing. The concept refers to a specific way of behaving, which is
                    <br />
                    pleasant. Someone with an established culture (a home set of values he
                    <br />
                    refers to habitually) is indeed predictably behaving according to his ethos.
                    <br />
                <p>Ethical behaviour can only be expected of a free organism. If one has no
                    <br />
                    alternatives, or one's actions do not derive from a free decision, the
                    <br />
                    action cannot be subject to a judgement re the extent of ethos.
                    <br />
                <p>The ethical act is neither always preferring the emotional, nor always
                    <br />
                    preferring the conceptual. The optimal ethics usually tries to keep an
                    <br />
                    equidistance to both the instinctive urges and to the rigid formalism.
                    <br />
                <p>The ethical decision evaluates both aspects and decides with a preference to
                    <br />
                    one alternative, although other alternatives would appear more rewarding to
                    <br />
                    the - less ethical - spectator.
                    <br />
                <p>The ethical behaviour forgoes a kind of immediate pleasure for the acting
                    <br />
                    person and thus allows a - different kind of - pleasure to be experienced in
                    <br />
                    the other person, the object (target) of the behaviour.
                    <br />
                <p>We ascribe to ethical behaviour that it follows rules, even in case we do
                    <br />
                    not understand deeply the rules we suppose to be behind the ethical kernel
                    <br />
                    of the actor.
                    <br />
                <p>The rules do not stick mechanically, neither to the impulses, nor to the
                    <br />
                    defences. An unjustly biased attitude is not ethical, irrespective of the
                    <br />
                    direction of the bias: neither the person who always prefers satisfaction,
                    <br />
                    nor the person who always prolongs the wait until satisfaction confront the
                    <br />
                    world in an ethical way.
                    <br />
                <p>The term &quot;de-mixing&quot; refers to an emotional polarisation within the subject
                    <br />
                    which is well schematised in the figure/s of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. An
                    <br />
                    ethical person is integrated and acts according to both sides of the coin.
                    <br />
                <p>In a statistical sense, ethics is then the description of the interplay
                    <br />
                    between two sets of logical relations, which have TWO mass points (central
                    <br />
                    elements, schwerpunkte). The order within the two subsets is by nature
                    <br />
                    different. Then, a continuous flip-flop takes place, while the system
                    <br />
                    maintains its central degree of predictability.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>In this model, emotional wishes and insight into duty are in a constant
                    <br />
                    deviation respective to each other. (The ethical behaviour can be seen as a
                    <br />
                    solution to the problem: &quot;I want to do A but should do B&quot;). This fits very
                    <br />
                    well into general concepts about the organisation of the brain, which regard
                    <br />
                    the emotions as a biochemical, hormonally describable state, and the thought
                    <br />
                    patterns as sequenced entities which have grid-like relation among each
                    <br />
                    other.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>Again and again the idea of interregulation shows itself to be quite fitting
                    <br />
                    to explanations of behaviour of intelligent systems.
                    <br />
                <p>And intelligent AND ethical system finds a reasonable balance between
                    <br />
                    choices referring to present or future satisfaction. It takes into account
                    <br />
                    that the moment and the future cannot fit into each other, that there is
                    <br />
                    always a residual of unpredictability, and that ethical behaviour happens
                    <br />
                    then, if one is ready to deal with the unpredictable in a non-dogmatic, open
                    <br />
                    way, with no undue preferences towards one of the extremes.
                    <br />
                <p>For information theory it may be noted that the two swarms cannot be made
                    <br />
                    into congruence with each other.
