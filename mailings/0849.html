<p>
After all, at the dawn of one conventional 3rd millennium - while 
<br />
being examined the information about the increasing number of larger 
<br />
local, regional and global problems that are generated by the blind 
<br />
and deaf dynamics of civilizing processes, which are reaching crisis 
<br />
point - I dare to consider not only necessary but indispensable to 
<br />
answer first the following question: Is the prevailing civilization, 
<br />
the so called Western one decorated with all kinds of ideologies, 
<br />
still a viable one? The two possible answers seem to offer at least 
<br />
two options.
<br />
<p>In case this civilization were still considered a reliable one: What 
<br />
humans should do from now onward in order to overcome the worst 
<br />
crisis ever faced by humankind?
<br />
<p>In case this civilization were considered not anymore workable: How 
<br />
humans might start to build at once a new way forward for the human 
<br />
society?
<br />
<p>Whatever could be the sensible alternative it seems proper to 
<br />
recognize that after all the whole civilizing adventure has been 
<br />
built essentially with two kinds of information: one is knowledge 
<br />
attained through the discovery of the assumed causal interactions 
<br />
that made possible the emergence and manifestation of the existent 
<br />
reality; the other is the set of aims, purposes, objectives, 
<br />
intentions,... formulated by decision makers who become engaged de 
<br />
facto in inventing causal interactions for being designed, 
<br />
implemented, modified for making them feasible and reliable enough,...
<br />
<p>In the first case it appears clearly evident that the knowledge 
<br />
acquired comprises those physical, chemical, biological, 
<br />
psychological, social,... facts and/or events involved, which 
<br />
happened along the lapses chosen for assuring a suitable 
<br />
comprehension of achievements and failures of civilizing concerns.
<br />
<p>In addition it is also indispensable to recognize that until today 
<br />
what prevails in the civilizational dynamics is the use of humans as 
<br />
resources (slaves, serfs, servants, lackeys, soldiers, workers, 
<br />
employees,... being included also researchers, experts and scholars) 
<br />
who are forced or invited compulsively to maintain the trends of the 
<br />
prevailing civilisation.
<br />
<p>Therefore as nothing can be changed in the past of the whole 
<br />
civilization, but everything can be done for learning how to make 
<br />
feasible the assumption that other human world (homosphere) - a 
<br />
humane one - is possible it becomes suitable to conceive ways for the 
<br />
invention of other causal interactions bearing in mind what Ludwig 
<br />
von Bertalanffy expressed in the 1960s.
<br />
<p>&quot;What is badly needed is a timely image of man. Since the previous 
<br />
proud image derived from religion and philosophy does not serve 
<br />
modern needs efficiently, a new image should be synthesized....I 
<br />
would contend that this is a very important business indeed -- to 
<br />
find out what actually is human.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;But what we need are not some hypothetical mechanisms better to 
<br />
explain some aberrations of the behaviour of the laboratory rat; what 
<br />
we need is a new conception of man.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;The image of man is not only a theoretical question, it is a 
<br />
question of the preservation of man as human.&quot; 
<br />
<p>Consequently, in my view it seems evident that the main challenge for 
<br />
FIS would be to identify how to invent causal interactions that may 
<br />
allow to approach scientifically, therefore humanely, the needs of:
<br />
<p>Comprehending what our homosphere, biosphere and ecosphere should be.
<br />
<p>Making consistent the human concerns with the planetary possibilities.
<br />
<p>Helping every human to recognize why humans must behave humanely
<br />
<p>Learning how human affairs should be determined according to ethical, 
<br />
ethological and ecological criteria
<br />
<p>Searching congruously how humans should play a responsible role on 
<br />
every terrestrial environment
<br />
<p>Grasping how humans might take care consciously of evolutionary  forces
