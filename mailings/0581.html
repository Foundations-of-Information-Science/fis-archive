In reply to Werner, I guess we all have our own theories, and that
<br />
makes for interesting debates.
<br />
<p>I agree with Werner that information is a result of a relation, but I
<br />
don't think it's simply a &quot;binary relation between a sender and a
<br />
receiver&quot; (Werner's post: May 30/02). That makes information something
<br />
akin to communication - a 'this' moving along a line from Sender to
<br />
Receiver. I don't think that communication is all that there is to
<br />
information. There is also 'cognition' - and that's a triadic process,
<br />
involving, as Christophe pointed out, a process where a system (the
<br />
'this' moving along)..is &quot;submitted to a constraint' within the realm
<br />
of probably both the sender and the receiver.
<br />
<p>In my view, information is 'informed mass' and is indeed a property of
<br />
a system. The transformation of free energy to bound or informed mass
<br />
is via this mass setting up measured relations with other informed
<br />
mass. That mass is then 'informed'...and its relations with other mass
<br />
are 'informational'. To reduce information to simply a package moving
<br />
from site A to site B doesn't answer my concerns about the process.
<br />
<p>Werner states that the 'flow of information between sender and
<br />
receiver is connected with decrease of uncertainty'....and I would
<br />
translate this to say that the interaction between the two is subject
<br />
to the input of informational constraints (as Chrsitophe pointed out),
<br />
which limits the interpretation or the nature of the interaction. This
<br />
is as  valid for a hydrogen atom interacting with an oxygen atom,
<br />
where the constraints of the interaction are operative within the laws
<br />
of configuration of the electron shells...as it is valid for a
<br />
biological organism where the constraints of the interaction are
<br />
operative within the normative habits of the species. That is, I am
<br />
suggesting that the interaction, which produces information, or
<br />
'informed mass', can only take place when there is a common realm of
<br />
stability between the two 'agents'. Along with the input from the
<br />
information constraints (which I call knowledge rather than
<br />
information), there will be a loss of energy...which is returned to
<br />
the field.
<br />
<p>As for measurement of 'meaning' - if one translates meaning to mean
<br />
'informed mass'...then, it might be possible to come up with a
<br />
measurement using the theme of complexity...where a system that
<br />
processes energy-to-mass (information) using a wider variety of
<br />
measurements (not merely iconic but also indexical and also symbolic),
<br />
and at a faster speed, can measure the transformation..faster.. That's
<br />
as much as I can think of now.
<br />
<p>As for the concept of intentionality, brought up by Christophe, I
<br />
would agree that it can't be confined to individual agent-based
<br />
intentionality, for that is a product only of the most complex
<br />
organisms. I agree with Christophe that we can consider evolution as
<br />
this act of increasing complexity - and it most certainly operates
<br />
independent of life ie, at the physico-chemical level.  Mind or logic
<br />
is not a factor only of the biotic world.
