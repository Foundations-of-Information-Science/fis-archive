Dear all,
<br />
<p>Some comments to Ted:  
<br />
1. I agree that 'logics' are legion. The distortion occurs in the expression
<br />
(language) and in the rational process (thought). The corollary is that all
<br />
information may be in fact misinformation (distortion of reality)
<br />
be it the myth of Oedipus, Seven Day Creationism or Superstring theory.
<br />
<p>answer: all depends on what we call information. information is a result of interaction between the system and its environment. I would never state that information is an exact reproduction or image of (whatever we call) reality. But this has nothing to do with &quot;misinformation&quot;, or &quot;distortion&quot;, these adjectives sound very subjective. Information IS NOT and cannot be the exact reproduction of what ever we call reality.  
<br />
<p>2. The flow of information (like the arrow of time) is an illusion.
<br />
<p>answer: as illusion you mean something we see, but doesnt exist like a fata morgana? humanity &quot;invented&quot; a scale for its own cycles of reproduction and we call it time. The scale is deduced from different frequencies of changes we are sumbitted on our planet and rythm of our life, like day and night, winter and summer, duration of a lifetime, etc.. but its a human scale, which is extended in both directions if we try to understand and measure the universe or the subatomic dimensions. The concept of illusion is not clear to me in realtion to what we are talking about.
<br />
<p>3. There is no empirical evidence for a logically necessary link between 'information' and
<br />
data, knowledge or truth or for the instantiation of 'information' in rational
<br />
processes (or computing). An informational experience is notoriously good or bad 
<br />
according to its perceived usefulness not its logicality. 
<br />
<p>answer: if we say that logics are legion, than of course why should we see a link between data, information, knowledge or truth (which is a very tricky concept in this kind of discussion).
<br />
a set of data (or signs..) can produce different information, acording to the internal and intrinsic logic of a system. but in any case (especially in what you call &quot;rational processes&quot;) information always has to be tested by the interaction of the system with its environment. This is the &quot;test&quot; whrere information has to be actualized.. maybe using your words.. where information is scanned if it is &quot;good or bad... right or wrong&quot;. 
<br />
<p>4. Intelligent fragmentation of views is inevitable.
<br />
<p>answer: yes, fragmentation is necessary, but only if these intelligent fragmentated views are put togehter in a new quality of view.. if not..???? 
<br />
<p>5. My personal theory is that we and possibly all living organisms qua species informationis relate to each other 
<br />
and to the Umwelt cinematically rather than computationally. 
<br />
<p>answer: sometimes, when I feel depressed, I have the same impression :-)))))
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
Norbert
