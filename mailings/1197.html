<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear All,
<br />
<p>Sorry for my silence during last weeks. I have seen very interesting 
<br />
postings but I was unable to participate. Now, please, let me return to the 
<br />
problem of &#x201c;measuring&#x201d; sustainability.
<br />
<p>I agree with Sergio that there are different and very valuable methods 
<br />
(Emergy, exergy, material flow accounting, ecological footprint&#x2026;) capable 
<br />
of accounting for a resource intrinsic value on a physical measurable basis 
<br />
but, since I know, there is not yet any method that could be in a similar 
<br />
extent 'sensitive to life'. Or in other words, I do not know, from a global 
<br />
perspective, any method that could inform us about the health of 
<br />
ecosystems, or how far away from the collapse (death) an ecosystem is.
<br />
<p>The previously referred methods provide an accounting of scarce natural 
<br />
resources used or consumed in whatever activity, and from this information 
<br />
we can indirectly estimate their importance on sustainability of the Earth. 
<br />
I like very much Emergy approach, because it considers the total energy 
<br />
income of Earth and it allows to know the maximum amount of energy that we 
<br />
have available for a sustainable development (am I right, Sergio?). There 
<br />
is another approach not mentioned yet, which corresponds to the Exergy 
<br />
Replacement Cost, proposed by Valero and Botero, that goes a step further 
<br />
of conventional accounting of natural resources. Very quickly, the 'exergy 
<br />
replacement cost' measures the amount of natural resources that would be 
<br />
required to restore to Nature, with our present technology, the resources 
<br />
that have been taken from her (See for more details Proceedings of the 
<br />
International Conference ECOS&#x2019;02, Berlin July 2002). This approach not only 
<br />
informs about the amount of natural resources consumed for producing 
<br />
whatever good or commodity, but also closes the loop and provides a measure 
<br />
of the resources that we should consume for returning to nature the 
<br />
materials we have taken from it.
<br />
<p>The problem of measuring the health of ecosystems (or their carrying 
<br />
capacity) is in my opinion related with some aspects of the FIS discussion 
<br />
about molecular recognition held a few months ago. In that discussion Shu 
<br />
Kun explained that he was working on the problem of integrating information 
<br />
in the process of molecular recognition and entropy. In very poor words (I 
<br />
am not specialist in biology) I understood that when the state of an 
<br />
organic molecule varies in the molecular recognition process, it is 
<br />
necessary for its detection and measurement, not only entropy but also 
<br />
information:
<br />
<p>&#x201c;Molecular recognition was the very first case which forces us to expand 
<br />
thermodynamic entropy concept to be an information theory entropy concept, 
<br />
because the mixing of two idea gases (mixing of oxygen and nitrogen, for 
<br />
instance) cannot be described by any detectable change of thermodynamic 
<br />
parameters (no heat change, no pressure change, no volume change and no 
<br />
temperature change). Therefore, the related Gibbs paradox regarding ideal 
<br />
gas mixing can never be logically discussed within the frame of 
<br />
thermodynamics...&#x201d;
<br />
<p>I think that the problem of measuring the health of ecosystems, or their 
<br />
carrying capacity, is similar in some extent. Pure physical properties, 
<br />
such as entropy, exergy, energy, emergy&#x2026; are not enough. I particularly 
<br />
work with exergy, which informs us about how far away from the equilibrium 
<br />
a system is. In this sense, exergy is also an interesting property for the 
<br />
measurement of living beings, because all of them depart from thermodynamic 
<br />
equilibrium. However, whatever non-living structure which is not in 
<br />
equilibrium with the environment has also exergy content, e.g. oil, coal... 
<br />
Further, some organic molecules with a given configuration are very 
<br />
relevant for living beings, but the same chemical component in other 
<br />
slightly different configuration, containing in measurable terms the same 
<br />
amount of exergy, can be a poison. Thus, exergy is a good measurement of 
<br />
non-equilibrium with respect the environment, but clearly it is not enough.
<br />
<p>Exergy is crucial for thermoeconomic analysis, applied to industrial plants 
<br />
(very different from ecosystems), where it informs about how the resources 
<br />
consumed in a plant are distributed among the different plant devices. This 
<br />
is an informational problem. As the thermoeconomic analysis techniques 
<br />
inform us about the productive process inside the plant and about the 
<br />
interactions among the different plant devices. Through the re-arrangement 
<br />
and simplification of physical information (temperatures, pressures, mass 
<br />
flow rates, compositions...) of different plant devices and mass flow 
<br />
streams in the plant, one obtains a new, abstract perspective of the 
<br />
industrial processes, informing about the interactions among the different 
<br />
plant devices from a productive viewpoint.
<br />
<p>If we could find a (several) physical property(ies) in ecosystems, similar 
<br />
to exergy in industrial processes, that could be relevant for the analysis 
<br />
of the interactions among the different living beings maybe we would be 
<br />
able of measuring their carrying capacity and their health since the 
<br />
viewpoint of their sustainability. My central point is that, in analogy 
<br />
with thermoeconomic analysis, it would not be necessary to go in depth to 
<br />
the details of the behavior of each living being, but to its interactions 
<br />
with respect to the others.
<br />
<p>Since ascendency is able of informing us about the organizational level of 
<br />
an ecosystem, maybe the combination of exergy analysis and ascendency could 
<br />
provide a more &#x201c;sensitive to life&#x201d; information about the carrying capacity 
<br />
of ecosystems? And maybe the work of Shu Kun could also be applied to the 
<br />
information-evaluation of the health of ecosystems?
<br />
<p>I would highly appreciate your comments respect these speculations 
<br />
(particularly on how to develop them formally).
<br />
<p>Best regards
<br />
<p>Luis
