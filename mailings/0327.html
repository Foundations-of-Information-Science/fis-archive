CALL for PAPERS and COMMENTS in order to participate in the Symposium V (P)
<br />
<p><p>&quot;Development of Perspectivism, as a Systems Epistemology&quot;
<br />
<p><p>!!&quot;&amp;&quot;¿?&quot;§&quot;¡¡
<br />
<p>This Symposium is one of the events that has been planned as an Homage to
<br />
Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy. It has been conceived as a FORUM for
<br />
presentation of papers, lectures, speeches, posters and also an Open Space
<br />
for self-organized debates and discussions. It will take place in the
<br />
<p>International Conference on Systems Thinking Globally Concerned
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy Anniversary Conference BAC 2001
<br />
<p>UNITY &lt;==&gt; through &lt;==&gt; DIVERSITY
<br />
<p>November 1-4, 2001
<br />
<p>University of Vienna and Vienna University of Technology
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
<p>!&quot;&amp;&quot;§&quot;//**&quot;#
<br />
<p>It aims firstly at making explicitly evident how the validity of knowledge
<br />
depends on the PERSPECTIVE from which that knowledge is perceived and
<br />
secondly at making clearer how the disciplinary and mutidisciplinary
<br />
validity of the Bertalanffian Perspectivism is a way of getting closer and
<br />
closer, though diversely, to the 'absolute truth' of every aspect of the
<br />
whole reality. Obviously all the perspectives, as views explicitly
<br />
expressed of a certain aspect of the reality, are valid. At the same time
<br />
none of them is more authentic than the other. This perspectivism is the
<br />
proper alternative between nihilism - the rejection to make an effort
<br />
towards the absolut truth because it is something impossible to reach - and
<br />
absolutism - the dogmatism that has generated the scientism, which assigns
<br />
value to nothing but science itself; and has produced the bloodstained
<br />
fanaticism in religious and political actions
<br />
<p>The Bertalanffy's perspectivism in practice oblige every learned person,
<br />
while learning, to be aware of his/her relative ignorance,  to recognize
<br />
that using his/her brain to the utmost he/she must increasingly try to be
<br />
aware of the limits of his/her (human) powers of cognition, because
<br />
&quot;perception is not a reflection of 'real things' [but rather] is an
<br />
interaction between knower and known&quot;. It means that the result of every
<br />
observation is partly the result of the viewpoint and methodology of the
<br />
observer
<br />
<p>The Perspectivism as Systems Epistemology is derived from the belief that
<br />
all what seems to be objective perception of real facts and events is
<br />
filtered by the biological features of the observer and his/her
<br />
psychocultural achievements.
<br />
