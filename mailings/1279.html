Dear Soeren and colleagues,
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bateson write : &quot;In fact, what we mean by information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the elementary unit of information - is a difference which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes a difference,....&quot; (Bateson 1973, p. 428).
</em><br />
<p>The problem with this definition is that it does not sufficiently
<br />
distinguish between information and meaningful information. Shannon's
<br />
definition of information is based on a first difference (e.g., a
<br />
variable, a probability distribution). A difference can only make a
<br />
difference with reference to a system. Shannon's definition precedes the
<br />
reference to a system and is therefore mathematical.
<br />
<p>The specification of the system of reference provides the information
<br />
with meaning. Thus, Soeren, here you have your &quot;qualia&quot;! A &quot;science of
<br />
consciousness&quot;, for example, can be expected to be different from
<br />
molecular biology or sociology. The systems can be expected to be
<br />
different in terms of how they communicate the disturbances
<br />
(differences) internally. Thus, they provide system-specific meaning to
<br />
the information.
<br />
<p>The meaningful information should then be distinguished from the meaning
<br />
processing within the system. Some systems, but not all, are able to
<br />
process both meaning and information. Other systems stabilize the
<br />
meaning and process only information. The interaction term between
<br />
information processing and meaning processing can be considered as
<br />
meaningful information (a difference which makes a difference). The
<br />
meaningful information adds to the probabilistic entropy historically
<br />
(with the axis of time), while meaning generation and meaning processing
<br />
feeds back on the arrow of time (potentially as negentropy).
<br />
<p>The various systems of reference can be specified, for example, by using
<br />
Spencer Brown's heuristics of &quot;draw a distinction&quot;. However, I find it
<br />
more useful to say &quot;specify the system of reference&quot;: what does the
<br />
system communicate when it communicates. For example, consciousness
<br />
processes thoughts; a living system communicates in terms of molecules.
<br />
Thus, another science is generated. The specification of how the system
<br />
communicates provides us with testable hypotheses. Non-linear dynamics
<br />
and information theory provide us only with the formal perspective.
<br />
<p>The accolade among all these specific theories of communication can be
<br />
provided by the mathematical theory of communication as a formal theory.
<br />
It facilitates the formulation of analogies and heuristics. The idea of
<br />
a grandiose theory which unites everything (like in Pierce's
<br />
philosophy), however, has to be abandoned as an historical project of
<br />
the late 19th and early 20th century (&quot;the unity of science&quot;). Of
<br />
course, one is welcome to dream, but it leads to speculative
<br />
philosophies. This project is incompatible with what we know about the
<br />
empirical development of the sciences: they develop in parallel and
<br />
sometimes incommensurate.
<br />
<p>With kind regards,
<br />
<p><p>Loet

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Allow me to quote from my own paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;To Bateson mind is a cybernetic phenomenon, a sort of mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ecology. The mental relates to the ability to register
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences. It is an intrinsic system property. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elementary, cybernetic system with its messages in circuits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is in fact the simplest mental unit, even when the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system does not include living organisms. Every living system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has the following characteristics which we are accustomed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call mental:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;1.The system shall operate with and upon differences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.The system shall consist of closed loops or networks of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pathways along which differences and transforms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences shall be transmitted. (What is transmitted on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuron is not an impulse, it is news of a difference).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Many events within the system shall be energized by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respondent part rather than by impact from the triggering part.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. The system shall show self-correctiveness in the direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of homeostasis and/or in the direction of runaway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self-correctiveness implies trial and error.&quot; (Bateson 1973 p. 458)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mind is synonymous with the cybernetic system which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprised of the total, self-correcting unit that prepares
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information. Mind is immanent in this wholeness. When Bateson
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says that mind is immanent he means that the mental is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immanent in the entire system, in the complete message
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circuit.&quot; (Brier 1992, p.79)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with Bateson and your suggestion, I think , is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it can only work in a Peircean framework or some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of objective idealism. Bateson do not want to separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind and intellect and talks about the intelligence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emotions. But when you look into his philosophical frame work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he never left Wiener's idea that. I quote my analysis again:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; (1980 p.103) Bateson further develops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his criteria for a cybernetic definition of mind:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;1.A mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.The interaction between parts of mind is triggered by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference, and difference is a nonsubstantial phenomenon not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loca-ted in space or time; difference is related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negentropy and entropy rather than to energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.Mental process requires collateral ener-gy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4.Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of determination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5.In mental process, the effects of difference are to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarded as transforms (i.e. coded versions) of events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preceding them. The rules of such transformation must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparatively stable (i.e. more stable than the content) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are themselves subject to transformation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6.The description and classification of these processes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformation disclose a hierarchy of logical types immanent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the phenomena.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These criteria are all famous within cybernetic understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind, and I will not discuss them further here. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; critique is concentrated on the foundation of the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria: &quot;difference is related to negentropy and entropy...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is problematic, that Bateson is following Norbert Wiener's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of a basic community between thermodynamics and Shannon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Weaver's theory of information based upon a shared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting point in the concept of entropy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding the problem of the relation between the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;information&quot; and the concept &quot;negative entropy&quot;. Bateson
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writes (Ruesch &amp; Bateson 1968, p. 177):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Wiener argued that these two concepts are synonymous; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this statement, in the opinion of the writers, marks the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greatest single shift in human thinking since the days of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato and Aristotle, because it unites the natural and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; social sciences and finally resolves the problems of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleology and the body-mind dichotomy which Occidental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought has inherited from classical Athens&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, Shannon's theory of information has never had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything to do with the semantic content of messages. Shannon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Weaver (1969 p.31-32 ) write:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; message selected at another point. Frequently the messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to some system with certain physical or conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities. These semantic aspects of communication are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that they are selected from a set of possible messages.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, what people and animals conceive as information is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something quite different from what Shannon and Weaver's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of information is about. As von Foerster (1980 p.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 20-21) concludes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;However, when we look more closely at these theories, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes transparently clear that they are not really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned with information but rather with signals and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reliable transmission of signals over unreliable channels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...&quot; &quot; (Brier 1992, p. 82-83).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The cybernetic view point fits nicely into a neodarwinistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint of meaning for the organism as weel as the species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 'survival value'. As such the cybernetic functionalism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective information concept fits nicely with neodarwinism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I am dissatisfied with the possiblity of defining life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind, emotions and meaning on this foundation, because there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not a theory of qualia in this whole paradigm - a paradigm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is also prevailing in the attempt to make a 'science of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness'. My alternative is like Stan's and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biosemioticians to use Peirce's semiotic philosophy as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fra,mework, because it includes a theory of qialia, mind,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning and signification. What we discuss is how radical we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to interpret Peirce. Here Stan is the most radical in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his pansemiotism, biosemiotic at the other side. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; major disagreement is between the cybernetic informationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the Peircian semioticians. Cybersemiotics is an attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to unite the two paradigms in a broader framework integrating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the core knowledge in the both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But anyway this point connnects FIS to the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical problems of mind and matter, qualia and meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'what is life'? - and I am not satisfied with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schrödingers answer to that question.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: Re: [Fis] meaning of meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thinking on the cellular foundations of 'meaning' does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there is a stumbling block of complexity that at the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be crossed. Even if the two extremes ---molecular details awfully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; networked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in every direction, and the absence of a viable 'dynamic' whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scheme for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the cell-- are rather obscure yet, there are intermediate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; territories where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one can point to some cellular 'doctrine' of meaning elaboration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by the cell.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Years ago I pointed out that filling-in the occurring 'functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; voids'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; provoked by the incoming signal, was the central response of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cellular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; productive machinery, involving both synthesis of proteins and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; degradation. However, putting this approach in some formal track
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ('informationally') was not easy at all. I much thank ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; received from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Shu-Kun's papers about mol. recog. &amp; entropy of mixing, and also a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; elegant message I could not answer from Loet (fis: 20.12.03. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have pasted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it below) so that a conceptual road  to approach cellular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processing of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; signals looms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The whole speculation would combine Robert Rosen's dynamic scheme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'forcing' and enzyme networks, with SK approach, Loet's and my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; voids idea (handled by a population of enzymes working as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'molecular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; autiomata'). It looks too heterogeneous, but at least one gets a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea on how COMMUNICATION with the environment relates to changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; advancement of a cycle, MEANING thus, derived of the entrenchment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; GENERATIVE and STRUCTURAL forms of information whose unending
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; weave and unweave the fabric of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A big question would be whether philosophies germane to the above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; applied to 'meaning' in other informational realms. Even to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; establish a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; natural background on mentality and the conceptual realm.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Pedro and colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I take the liberty to fight this argument all the way since I wish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correctly understood. I agree with much of what you say and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appreciate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the example of the enzyme regulating the flux efficiently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that it is important not only to distinguish between the flux of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; resources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and the entropy that it generates, but also between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thermodynamic and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probabilistic entropy that is generated by this flux. Thus, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; three systems of reference (theories) in the case of your example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The distinction is important because we are interested in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory. Historically, authors from the side of physics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chemistry have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attempted to subsume probabilistic entropy under thermodynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entropy as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; special case or a little fraction that can be fully understood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (chemical) physics. The argument becomes then often unclear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; authors do not specify the system of reference other than as &quot;the&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; With &quot;the&quot; system, of course, they mean &quot;nature&quot;. (One can show
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probabilistic entropy is smaller than the thermodynamic entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; times the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Boltzmann-contant.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Information theory however provides us with an entropy calculus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first independent of the system of reference. Therefore we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also study
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the probabilistic entropy in an economic system. Whenever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; communicated a probabilistic entropy is generated by this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; redistribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For example, in this exchange of emails we can count the threads,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mails, the words, etc., and compute in each dimension how much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (probabilistic) entropy is generated. This is straightforward and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not have anything to do with the thermodynamic entropy produced by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; energy needed for all the systems which carry the exchange. (One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; compute a thermodynamic entropy of the exchange of message, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not inform us at all about the exchange.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am sure that you are able to elaborate this for your example of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enzyme. The question one has to raise first when one studies the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probabilistic entropy of a system is: what does the system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; redistribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; when it communicates? This provides us with the specification of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hypothesis. (George Spencer Brown would call this an observation =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinction + an identification, but that may be confusing.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Second, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can ask how one can indicate the communication. This provides us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; operationalization. Thirdly, the measurement can inform us about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relative quality of the hypothesis. A system which operates in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; energy redistribution can then be considered as a special case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; requires a special theory (e.g., physics). But the one system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reduced to the other without a specific theory (that can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tested!).
