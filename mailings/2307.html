                    Loet:
                    <br />
                <p>Yes!
                    <br />
                <p>First, I should point out that my reference frame is usually the
                    <br />
                    individual human being, the individual patient in a physician's
                    <br />
                    office, the individual mathematician, the individual farmer, the
                    <br />
                    individual dynamic system within an ecosis. I suspect that your
                    <br />
                    reference frame is the social system composed from such individuals.
                    <br />
                <p>Secondly, I inadvertently made reference to my personal works on the
                    <br />
                    pathways of emergence of symbolic logics from chemical symbols that
                    <br />
                    are not discussed on this FIS list serve, so that my remarks were not
                    <br />
                    fully in context.
                    <br />

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion, Jerry brings here precisely to the point what has
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; remained an open question in our discussion. Meaning has to

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; preserved in hierarchies at the chemical and biological level.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Yes. Living systems are constructed and function on the basis of such
                    <br />
                    &quot;Meaning&quot;.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In discourse, meaning can be deconstructed and reconstructed, and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore is at variance. The question then is: how much is it
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; constrained by historical contingencies?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    Loet, I think the sentiment is meaningful but perhaps to broad.
                    <br />
                    Perhaps the sentence implies an exactness of meaning, the
                    <br />
                    meaningfulness that permits a logical analysis of the sentence or
                    <br />
                    sentiment.
                    <br />
                    Public discourse, public media, the arts, etc, use exploratory
                    <br />
                    meanings as a way of exploring spaces of meanings.
                    <br />
                    But not all discourse is public.
                    <br />
                    Professional discourse is meaningful - for example, mathematics papers.
                    <br />
                    Personal discourse between two lovers can be meaningful - even in
                    <br />
                    separate languages.
                    <br />
                    So, &quot;discourse&quot; sort of implies at least two individual systems and
                    <br />
                    some sort of back and forth between them. In other words,
                    <br />
                    communication.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us first consider the psychological level. Is the Cogito part
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the phase space? This has been a subject of intense
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical discussion (mind/body problem, determination/free
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; will, etc.). Obviously, the Cogito is constrained and the space for
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; variation in providing psychological meaning to events
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (information) is limited. However, the intersubjectivity among
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cogitantes--that which Husserl calls the Cogitatum--does no longer
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to be constrained. The depends on its organization.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    Yes. But, each individual generates their psychological state in
                    <br />
                    real time. I have no reason to believe that any two individuals have
                    <br />
                    the same psychological states. Indeed, I would argue from the basis
                    <br />
                    of genetics that no two individuals can have exactly the same
                    <br />
                    psychological states.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The hierarchical organization of society is associated in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; sociological literature with the high cultures like the Holy Roman
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Empire. The breaking of this order is considered as modernization.

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading can be considered symbolic for this. The printing press,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc., then also allowed for new meaning to be codified, that is,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporarily fixed but open for de- and reconstruction. The social
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; system seems a system that has to remain on this borderline between
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; fixing meanings and reconstructing them. The fixing is needed for
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; us (as contingencies) and for us to live in institutions, but not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic to the operation.
                    </em><br />
                <p>The mathematical community continues to insist that the text has a
                    <br />
                    single meaningfulness.
                    <br />
                    So, we must semantically distinguish between the notion of
                    <br />
                    communication with an exactness and the notion of communication that
                    <br />
                    transfers some degree of meaningfulness but less than exact.
                    <br />
                <p>(Shannon, of course, insisted on exactness of information transfer
                    <br />
                    and devised a mathematical method that detected the failure of
                    <br />
                    exactness and furthermore, another mathematical method to correct the
                    <br />
                    error such that the original message was restorable to its exact form.)
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that if meaning can be a source of variance, it can
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; no longer be considered as fixed.
                    </em><br />
                <p>I have suggested above that meaningfulness need not be exact, based
                    <br />
                    on individual (biological) preparation for the communication.
                    <br />
                    This does not invoke statistical analysis of messages. (I suppose
                    <br />
                    that you introduce &quot;variance&quot; in a statistical sense.)
                    <br />
                <p>This suggests that the issue is the distinction between a single
                    <br />
                    unique meaning for every text (perhaps the goal of mathematics and
                    <br />
                    physics, the &quot;for all time and place&quot; syndrome,) and the
                    <br />
                    contingencies intrinsic to biological communication among individual
                    <br />
                    biological organisms.
                    <br />
                <p>BTW, I think Aristotle avoided the categorical error, in part, by
                    <br />
                    separating the concepts of individual from species and the concepts
                    <br />
                    of species from genera.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;From the bio - logic point of view, this Aristotelian distinction is
                    <br />
                    vital. The reduction FROM the concept of individual - species -
                    <br />
                    genera TO the set theory basis of merely individual and genera is
                    <br />
                    genuinely unhealthy for communication.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>On a separate topic, the topic of the Robert Rosen's works, it
                    <br />
                    appears that the critical distinction between
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;mechanics&quot; as mathematics (that is, all of mathematics as merely
                    <br />
                    mechanical positionings of symbols)
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;mechanics&quot; as chemical structure and change (for example, catalysis
                    <br />
                    of chemical bond changes)
                    <br />
                <p>is not understood by many.
                    <br />
                <p>The curious reader is referred to the last chapter of Rosen's &quot;Life
                    <br />
                    Itself&quot; for this rather fine semantic and syntactic distinction.
