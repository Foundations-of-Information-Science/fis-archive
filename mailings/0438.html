THE WORLD JUST WATCHES
<br />
by Neta Golan*
<br />
<p>For the international peace observers currently holed up within Yasser
<br />
Arafat's presidential compound - myself among them - it is not Israeli
<br />
actions but the inaction of the international community that has most
<br />
shocked us.
<br />
<p>Inside the pock-marked building surrounded by Israeli tanks and
<br />
snipers, there is one question on everyone's minds: How many
<br />
international laws does Israel need to break before the United Nations
<br />
demands a full and immediate Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank?
<br />
<p>The list of violations is reaching unprecedented levels, even for a
<br />
conflict with a long history of ugly behavior on both sides. Collective
<br />
punishment is illegal under international law, but Israel has now
<br />
escalated from interrupting food shipments to shutting off water to the
<br />
Palestinian city of Ramallah, endangering the lives of 120,000 people.
<br />
The shelling of Palestinian civilian structures such as power plants,
<br />
schools and sewage facilities is occurring at an alarming rate.
<br />
Unarmed civilians are being killed daily.
<br />
<p>There are also growing reports of Israeli troops raiding hospitals and
<br />
firing on ambulances and journalists. These are grave breaches of
<br />
international conventions.
<br />
<p>Anthony Shadid, a correspondent for The Boston Globe, was shot on
<br />
Sunday as he walked away from an interview in our building. The
<br />
area, under full Israeli control, was quiet and there was no crossfire.
<br />
Shadid was wearing the required signs on his back and front indicating
<br />
that he was with the official press. Soon after he arrived at a hospital,
<br />
Israeli troops raided it with machine guns drawn. When he was
<br />
subsequently transferred for further medical treatment, his ambulance
<br />
came under fire from Israeli soldiers manning a checkpoint.
<br />
<p>Israel is making a mockery of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the
<br />
founding document of international human rights law, and by its tacit
<br />
acceptance, the United Nations is severely eroding its credibility in the
<br />
region and beyond.
<br />
<p>Those of us inside the presidential compound need help desperately -
<br />
but not half as much as those on the outside who are facing the full
<br />
brunt of the mass round-ups and house-to-house raids. The situation
<br />
cannot deteriorate much further. Medical supplies have run out. Food
<br />
is scarce.
<br />
<p>Pressure from abroad is essential. The presence of international
<br />
&quot;human shields&quot; throughout the occupied territories has been very
<br />
important in limiting the indiscriminate nature of Israeli military actions.
<br />
<p>Nothing short of a UN demand for a full withdrawal to the 1967 UN
<br />
recognized borders, however, will succeed in restoring calm and
<br />
opening the way for peace negotiations. Simply pulling the troops out
<br />
of the recently invaded regions will not suffice. In the compound we
<br />
are left wondering, not without fear, whether the international
<br />
community will allow the permanent expansion of the already illegal
<br />
occupation and the exile if not assassination of the Palestinian leader.
<br />
<p>* Neta Golan, an Israeli, is among the 40 international peace
<br />
observers occupying Yasser Arafat's besieged office. This comment,
<br />
which she wrote with Ian Urbina, an associate editor of the
<br />
Washington-based magazine Middle East Report, was contributed to
<br />
the International Herald Tribune.
