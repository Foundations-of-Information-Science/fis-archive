Dear Gotfried
<br />
<p>My point is, that the information codes are always based om pragmatics in a field of personal and communicative meanings of  bodies with their own historicity in their flesh. This embodies knowledge is the interpretants in Peirce's triadic sign process th
<br />
at creates the meaning or signification of a sign. As Luhmann points out then we reduce and select messaged on the basis of social meaning. 
<br />
<p>So my point is that  we are always already working on the basis of a social field of meaning carried by sign commmunication. Underneath that there is the psychological field of meaning that do not communicate but only think. We have realised that these pe
<br />
rsonal emotions are an important part of intelligence and cognition. On the next level is the biological autopoietic system making the basic survival value conditions and interest for the whole cognitive system. So I think that meaning is connected to liv
<br />
ing systems, but we might have to operate with three differente interpenetrating levels of it.
<br />
<p>Luhmann's theory's functionality works on the basis of these fields of meaning, but it does n ot explain them theoretically. But I am interestred in this level of explanation and its relation to the concept of information. As Luhmann points out, f you say
<br />
&nbsp;something twice, then the information is the same, but the meaning can be different - amongst other things because the context has changed.

Dear Fisers,

<p><p>Soren wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the basis of evolutionary and ecological thinking using selection
</em><br />
theory going into socio-communication on a basis of meaning we might be
<br />
able to do something. This is what some of Niklas Luhmann's work is about,
<br />
where he operates with biological, psychological and social systems
<br />
autopoiesis (may be it is better to talk of organisational closure as
<br />
Varela and Mingers suggests). Luhmann work with information and meaning as
<br />
two different concepts.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The part of his huge work I have read and understood I think there are
</em><br />
many valuable things, but also that his meaning concept is insufficiant
<br />
founded and that his understanding - at least  of Peirce's - semiotics is
<br />
not sufficient. So future work should try to integrate the progresses he
<br />
has made.
<br />
<p><p>Indeed, Luhmann*s approach turned out to be very fruitful. Although he died
<br />
some days ago at the age of 70, his work is continued by a lot of
<br />
&quot;disciples&quot;, and partly I am one of them.
<br />
As he tried to establish a general system theory using Weber, Parsons,
<br />
Habermas and also bio-approaches like autopoiesis, he tried to show that
<br />
all kind of creative or genetic structures show similar qualities:
<br />
redundancies and feed-back-loops, which  allow a return to prior stages of
<br />
evolution (he called it re-entry, term I think he took from Spencer-Brown)
<br />
to &quot;renew&quot; the gentic material under new circunstances.
<br />
On the sociological level this kind of re-entry - which besides enhances
<br />
variety - allows an important widening of the limits of structural
<br />
adaptability and of the range of internal system communication.
<br />
Following Luhmann, the significance of information emerges if an event
<br />
turns out to be selective, if it chooses out of several possible states of
<br />
a system. The ability to recognize differences has therefore to be a basic
<br />
quality of systems, linked to self-referencialitiy.
<br />
Such an observing or measuring system - and there is no doubt that social
<br />
systems are of that kind - works with a closed and circular structure which
<br />
decomposes immediatly if there is no constructive activity to delay
<br />
decomposition.
<br />
I made my own picture looking at the emergence o a new significance of
<br />
signs by exampling it with a card game, usually played by using sequences
<br />
of four different nipes. The significance of a certain card in the game in
<br />
relation to the other cards in the players hand changes: the As may be the
<br />
highest-value card, but if you expect a king to complete your poker, the As
<br />
dealed to you does not create the significant additional value. The same
<br />
may happen to the partners hands.
<br />
That means: there is an information value in the elements (events) itself,
<br />
an &quot;Eigenvalue&quot;, but it is only &quot;rescued&quot; when placed into an appropriate
<br />
sequence.
<br />
Time, like Pedro stated, enters the game. But more than the duration of
<br />
time in seconds or hours, what really matters is the factor
<br />
&quot;syncronicitiy&quot;. It determines if the moment of placement is or not
<br />
appropriate to &quot;make the difference&quot; in a given sequence. Syncronicity
<br />
means the coincidence of events in time, so that one &quot;fits&quot; to the other.
<br />
(e.g. the coincidence of 4 kings at the same time in the players hand)
<br />
Luhmann uses &quot;coincidence&quot; as an important part of information-reality.
<br />
There has not to exist any link of causality to establish information: just
<br />
two events which apear simultaneously or in a predictable way to be
<br />
reffered one to each other are enough.
<br />
Like in the following example: &quot;When the neighbour enters his garage, I
<br />
usually begin to cook&quot;. The causality in this case is purely informational.
<br />
He knows, it is 11.30h a.m., time to prepare the meal. In short his wife
<br />
will come home from work.
<br />
Some signals have start character. A sequence of events may be allocated in
<br />
its functional role. So it may represent a whole sequence. When it appears
<br />
(when the neigbour enters the garage), the sequence &quot;working day lunch&quot; is
<br />
called and executed.
<br />
The variety of cultural codes (VEMs) is controlled and limited by social
<br />
conditioning, based on the tradition of the past. Does this not &quot;work&quot; any
<br />
more, then social transformation processes, inpredictable in its
<br />
realization, take over. This affects  the process of sequencing cultural
<br />
codes, that means the education system in the large sense of the term.
<br />
<p>To continue the bio-soc parallels: Sequencing in molecular biology means
<br />
composition of an information-code which refers to cells in an organism.
<br />
Sequencing in cultural sociology means composition of an information-code
<br />
which refers to events in an organisation. Cells, like events, die and are
<br />
substituted by others, similars, but different. Different events mean a
<br />
different sequence in elementary information codes, which may express a
<br />
social transformation as a change of (usual) behaviour.
<br />
Different from the meaning of the code himself (determined by previous
<br />
recording), the meaning of the (accidental) change is not determined
<br />
previously: there are usually many alternatives of changed behaviour before
<br />
one of them is executed.
<br />
This variety creates a higher degree of liberty of choice. There is just
<br />
one condition: the appearence of the emerging information-sequence has to
<br />
be different from the previous. Establishing this difference, the new
<br />
fenomena may be functional within a &quot;division of labour&quot; in a defined
<br />
network.
<br />
<p>I know this is a rather functionlist approach subject to severe
<br />
epstemological claims. But as it works in everyday life, it deals with
<br />
reality, and that &quot;fits&quot;.
<br />
