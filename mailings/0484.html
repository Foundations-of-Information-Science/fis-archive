<p>
I agree with those who consider that information is a basic process of
<br />
all systems, including the physical. As Gyorgi points out, a helium
<br />
atom is 'informed' in that its mass is organized in a particular way
<br />
and that formation operates in a continuous manner and will not
<br />
violate those stable  'laws of formation'.
<br />
<p>The way I see it, information is a dynamic process, transforming
<br />
'uninformed or symmetrical energy/mass' to asymmetrical or 'informed
<br />
energy/mass'. This dynamic process, found within the physico-chemical,
<br />
the biological and the socioconceptual realms (and yes, there is a
<br />
qualitative 'jump' between these three realms), operates within a
<br />
series of ontological and epistemological 'cuts' that move energy/mass
<br />
from a symmetrical or near-symmetrical to an asymmetrical state.
<br />
Information is the means by which energy mends these cuts. Information
<br />
then, is really the establishment of increasingly complex relations of
<br />
mass/energy.
<br />
<p>Because of these cuts, we are dealing with differences of space. There
<br />
is local space where energy/mass is capable of entering into relations
<br />
with other mass - but these relations are strictly local. The
<br />
relations, which I consider are actions-of-encoded-measurement are
<br />
local measurements (this particular molecule related to that
<br />
particular molecule; this particular insect related to that particular
<br />
flower).  There is global or communal space, where the measurements
<br />
can operate within an entire community ( all insects in that genre
<br />
behave in a certain way). Importantly, there is internal space and
<br />
external space. After all - if we didn't have this basic ontological
<br />
cut - our universe would exist in pure symmetry, something like a bowl
<br />
of jello.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, importantly, there are the epistemological cuts - which
<br />
establish the difference between codal properties that operate only
<br />
within the singular instance (this particular insect) and those that
<br />
operate within the formal genre (all insects of that species). These
<br />
cuts involve time. Present time - which is merely 'nowness' of the loc
<br />
al relation. Perfect time - a crisp external definition. And
<br />
progressive time that involves the past/future continuity of a code
<br />
(the continuity of the code of helium).
<br />
<p>With the above conceptual frame, I can come up with three processes of
<br />
information dynamics. Data, Information and Knowledge.
<br />
<p>First- my concept is that information is an action, a process, of
<br />
establishing relations between energy/mass, such that this mass/energy
<br />
can then exist as 'informed mass/energy', which is to say, it has a
<br />
spatiotemporal reality - even as a thought, as well as an atom or
<br />
cell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dynamics require those cuts, which set up gradients of
<br />
energy/mass. These asymmetrical gradients then exist by virtue of
<br />
establishing relations - encoded or measured relations. These
<br />
relations cannot be ad hoc and random or our universe would be a mess.
<br />
Nor can they be completely frozen or our universe would be a crystal
<br />
block. Therefore, dynamics requires gradients of relations, gradients
<br />
of measurement, which enable brief relations, crisp and more stable
<br />
relations, and continuous law-like relations. That's three basic types
<br />
of relations and therefore, three basic types of mass/energy.
<br />
<p>DATA is what I refer to as brief relations. They are a relation set up
<br />
between one mass and another mass, where the energy from X enters the
<br />
field of the energy/mass of Y. This brief contact is data, highly
<br />
charged, in present time (brief), highly entropic. Will it be accepted
<br />
in full? Rejected in full? Accepted in part? If accepted in part (and
<br />
it's never ever accepted in full!)...then, the system will transform
<br />
it, 'interpret' it...within its own KNOWLEDGE base. As interpreted,
<br />
this energy/mass is now a part of Y system's information. It is in
<br />
Perfect time, 'held', it is more stable. How long will it stay as
<br />
information before entropically dissipating?
<br />
<p>So- INFORMATION is data that has been accepted within a system, moved
<br />
into a different time phase (perfect rather than present time),
<br />
encoded within the normative codes of a system. It is 'informed mass',
<br />
held by the measurement relations of the system.
<br />
<p>KNOWLEDGE is the formal continuous Laws of a system, that enable it to
<br />
process and move data to information. Knowledge is operative in
<br />
progressive time; it is an abstract formal process of measurement (ie,
<br />
the laws of atomic particles, of molecular formation, of biological
<br />
entities, ..and the normative laws of societies. Some call these laws
<br />
'structure'. I prefer to retain the term knowledge, for I don't want
<br />
to set up an image of a stable structure. As Gyuri also points out,
<br />
the knowledge base or information capacity (knowledge, potential)
<br />
increases during evolution. An atom has far less knowledge-or energy
<br />
processing capacity than a biological cell...and the human realm has
<br />
the most complex capacity (and as a result, must pay for that capacity
<br />
by a concomitant requirement that is knowledge base and information is
<br />
volatile, its dynamics are at high speed).
<br />
<p>As Gyuri says, 'we can get information only from interacting
<br />
objects' - and what you have is a dynamic process of
<br />
energy-interactions, where energy/mass from one gradient field will
<br />
move into the energy field of another gradient. It is, in this
<br />
tentative state, called 'Data'. If accepted and recoded within the
<br />
normative formal codes (Knowledge) of this new energy
<br />
field/mass...then.... it moves into a more stable relation, operative
<br />
within perfect time and is Information.
<br />
This informed mass will itself contribute to the knowledge-base of the
<br />
system, for knowledge is itself an evolving process.
<br />
<p>This is just a brief outline, but the entire system of energy/mass
<br />
dynamics - as operative within a series of increasing ontological and
<br />
epistemological gradients sets up spatial and temporal differences
<br />
that enable different types of relations of energy/mass - resulting in
<br />
data, information and knowledge. Such an architecture enables complex
<br />
processes of energy/mass transformation.
