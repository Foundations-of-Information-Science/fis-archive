Dear Werner and FISers, 
<br />
You will find hereunder some comments to what Werner wrote on May 30th.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear FISers, 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am following our discussion already a while without interfering. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After reading again about 100 pages of discussion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would like to make the following remarks: 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We should never forget in our discussion about basic problems that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information concept has a very solid fundament in physics, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication, computers, internet etc.. We are living in an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information society and several concepts are simply fixed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;already they cannot be traded freely. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anybody who forgets all this will be like Antaeus. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me mention a few concepts which as I believe should not be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thrown away lightheartly: 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- information is a binary relation between a sender and a receiver 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(I cannot understand why several FISers like to consider information as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property of a system itself, like mass, energy, momentum in physics. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me and I believe to any engineer, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information is binary as interaction in physics it is a relation between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two things),   
</em><br />
<p>As you write in your FIS 2002 contribution, there is also the &quot;bound 
<br />
information&quot; as &quot;potential information (like disks, tapes, books)&quot;.  
<br />
I understand the &quot;information as property of the system&quot; as being
<br />
this naturaly existing bound info. Ex: the weight, volume and 
<br />
atomic composition of a stone. Existing within the stone as &quot;being 
<br />
of the stone&quot; but not available as measured (interpreted) figures.  
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- flow of information between sender and receiver is connected 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with decrease of uncertainty (why we should give up such an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extremely fruitful concept due to Shannon. Communication networks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and by the way also our internet discussion would break down. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We should not ignore the reality of communication based on this). 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- information flow is connected with entropy flow, this is expressed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by the Boltzmann Shannon formulae. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Entropy in physics is one of the fundaments of any physical theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the number of technical applications from cars to refrigerators are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncountable). 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course there many other aspects which are more or less fixed by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;practice. 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To me the unsolved problems are: 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- what is the exact relation between physical entropy and information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy (there were very interesting remarks by Shu-Kun Lee on this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;L = I + S but things are much more complicated, by the way also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information content relation to stability is not a clear concept). 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- is there any measure of the meaning of a message (this is indead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a very complicated question, Shannons measure expresses clearly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only the quantity not the meaning)   
</em><br />
<p>Prior talking about the measure of a meaning of a message, I feel 
<br />
we need first to define the meaning of a message/information. 
<br />
One way to this is to consider that a  meaningful information 
<br />
is generated by a system submitted to a constraint. When the 
<br />
system receives an incident information that has some connection
<br />
with the constraint, the system will generate a meaningful 
<br />
information that will be used by the system to satisfy the 
<br />
constraint (the system can also transmit the meaningful 
<br />
information to other systems, if it is needed for the 
<br />
satisfaction of the constraint). You can find some details on this
<br />
in my FIS 2002 contribution.
<br />
Now, regarding the measure of the meaning, as you write, it has 
<br />
obviously nothing to do with the Shanon measure of quantity of
<br />
information. The only possibility I see is to somehow measure 
<br />
the participation of the meaningful information to the 
<br />
satisfaction of the constraint of the system. But this is not
<br />
easy to quantify..... Any idea ?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- the specific properties of information in biological/social systems 
</em><br />
<p>One could say that information incident on biological/social 
<br />
systems can generate specific meanings in these systems, 
<br />
depending upon the relations these information have with the 
<br />
constraints of the systems. So the meanings generated in the 
<br />
systems will depend upon two elements: 1) the nature of the
<br />
systems (theirs constraints to be satisfied), and 2) the 
<br />
relation existing between the the incident informatoin and 
<br />
the constraint of the system. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- selforganization of information processing systems in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution of life. 
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By the way to me information is not a physical concept, it is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contained in the axioma of physics. There was no information before the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first living system appeared on earth and as far as I see information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processing is always at least indirectly connected with biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social technical systems. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It would be very interesting for me to learn about an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Information processing system absolutely independent from life. 
</em><br />
<p>I agree that information exists only as part of something 
<br />
(modulation of a signal, difference in chemical density, 
<br />
any variation of energy).
<br />
Regarding information processing, I would look at the system on 
<br />
which the information is incident. Does the system have an aim, 
<br />
a target, a finality, an intention (i.e. a constraint that
<br />
must be satisfied)? 
<br />
If yes, then I would consider that the system can process the 
<br />
information (receive the information to use it, in other words
<br />
generate internaly a meaning). If we consider evolution 
<br />
(increasing complexity) as a finality (even localy), then I feel 
<br />
it is posible to talk about information processing independent 
<br />
of life. Would you agree ?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Summarizing I thing this discussion is extremely inspiring and useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but sometimes we have to come back to our earth. 
</em><br />
<p>Yes. We need both head in the sky and feet on earth.
<br />
<p>Regards 
<br />
<p>Christophe Menant
