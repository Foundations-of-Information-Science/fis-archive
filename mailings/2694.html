                <p>
                    Dear List,
                    <br />
                <p>I agree with Stan Salthe that Tainter's &quot;kinds of complexity&quot; are not
                    <br />
                    kinds at all but simply different circumstances in which complexity
                    <br />
                    appears.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;From a anthropological point of view, it should be clear that no
                    <br />
                    scholar wisely references Wikipedia unless it is to study the
                    <br />
                    anthropological and sociological implications of its unreliable
                    <br />
                    nature and its risk to the public. It is hardly surprising that one
                    <br />
                    would find conceptual diversity there.
                    <br />
                <p>How does an anthropologist quantify complexity? What are the measures
                    <br />
                    that illustrate Tainter's claim that complexity has increased in
                    <br />
                    societies? It is not clear to me that these claims are true. The
                    <br />
                    numbers of individuals in societies has increased - and we certainly
                    <br />
                    appear to prefer to believe that our society is more complex than
                    <br />
                    earlier societies - but there seems to be little basis for this
                    <br />
                    intuition. These claims need to be founded upon some means of
                    <br />
                    quantification (per algorithmic complexity is, for example).
                    <br />
                <p>Does an individual in a hunter gatherer society, in fact, live in a
                    <br />
                    more complex society than an individual in today's society? In my own
                    <br />
                    proximity, for example, I doubt that my social relationships are
                    <br />
                    fewer than that of a hunter gatherer in a relatively sized community
                    <br />
                    of the hunter gatherer period - my family relationships are likely to
                    <br />
                    be simpler since I am disconnected from extended family - it is true
                    <br />
                    that all my relationships have a greater geographic diversity and the
                    <br />
                    medium by which I communicate has a different nature often, but this
                    <br />
                    does not seem to be enough to increase the complexity of my
                    <br />
                    individual experience.
                    <br />
                <p>The number of relationships that any individual can possibly maintain
                    <br />
                    is surely self limiting and this would constrain the complexity that
                    <br />
                    any individual - any single node in the complexity - can manifest. If
                    <br />
                    the nodes are bound in this way then complexity is also also bound
                    <br />
                    despite scale.
                    <br />
                <p>It seems likely that the complexity in societies has a natural
                    <br />
                    threshold. While the overall number of unique arrangements may
                    <br />
                    increase, the actual complexity never breaches a self-limiting
                    <br />
                    threshold. If I were to apply algorithmic measures of complexity, I
                    <br />
                    would say there is a limit to the number of steps that any given
                    <br />
                    individual can manage.
                    <br />
                <p>Simply enumerating elements tells us nothing about complexity.
                    <br />
                    Diversity does not equal complexity, it may be the product of
                    <br />
                    complexity but because diversity is increasing does not mean that
                    <br />
                    complexity is increasing.
                    <br />
                <p>For example, in algorithmic terms - if, in the example given, the
                    <br />
                    organization in which the artifacts were shipped to Africa actually
                    <br />
                    required more steps to assemble a weapon than other more orderly
                    <br />
                    organizations, then the system was indeed more complex, not merely
                    <br />
                    &quot;complicated.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>If the behavior of a society for an individual becomes simpler
                    <br />
                    because of arising diversity then the complexity is, in fact,
                    <br />
                    reduced, not increased, for that individual. Overall complexity may
                    <br />
                    remain the same.
                    <br />
                <p>I feel a clear definition of complexity is missing from Tainter's
                    <br />
                    discussion and I see distinct concepts being confused. I find myself,
                    <br />
                    for example, wanting a clear specification of complexity versus scale
                    <br />
                    and diversity.
                    <br />
                <p>I could argue that &quot;civilization&quot; is simply the inevitable product of
                    <br />
                    scale. Simply, just the result of the number of individuals.
                    <br />
                    Creativity has nothing to do with it *except to the degree that
                    <br />
                    solutions are kept within the bounds of the complexity threshold* and
                    <br />
                    despite scale the complexity of the system is unchanged beyond an
                    <br />
                    identifiable threshold.
                    <br />
                <p>In my view scale and complexity are not necessarily correlated and
                    <br />
                    problem solving efforts, in fact, do not increase in complexity -
                    <br />
                    they change and get smarter. &quot;Smarter&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot; is a word
                    <br />
                    that seems to be missing from Tainter's discussion - intelligence
                    <br />
                    necessarily increases so that solutions live within the bounds of the
                    <br />
                    available complexity threshold.
                    <br />
                <p>When the complexity necessary for individuals in the system to
                    <br />
                    operate effectively has requirements that go beyond these limits then
                    <br />
                    the system remains constrained to function at the capacity of the
                    <br />
                    threshold - it simply cannot breach this threshold. Instituted
                    <br />
                    systems that require more complexity simply fail until the system is
                    <br />
                    constrained by natural selection and solutions within the complexity
                    <br />
                    threshold are re-established.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, in this limited response I have applied a simple algorithmic
                    <br />
                    definition of complexity - the number of steps required to do
                    <br />
                    anything - and I have avoided other characteristics of complexity -
                    <br />
                    such as decidability and termination - Tainter may be applying some
                    <br />
                    other measure and have some other way of characterizing complexity.
                    <br />
                    If he does, it isn't mentioned in his posting.
                    <br />

                    <br />
