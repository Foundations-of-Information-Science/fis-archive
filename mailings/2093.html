                    <br />
                    I cannot but agree with your holistic picture! However, when talking about
                    <br />
                    economy I find it useful to distinguish institutional tuning (the aspect of
                    <br />
                    institutional change that is designed on purpose as distinguished from the
                    <br />
                    spontaneous change which arises from agent interactions) from the kind of
                    <br />
                    self-organization that is implied in SOC models. I use it as a
                    <br />
                    methodological and epistemological critique of mechanicistic models applied
                    <br />
                    to economic dynamics, which is largely historical and where I claim that
                    <br />
                    institutional framework must be explicitly stated if we are to understand a
                    <br />
                    phenomenon - say a business cycle. There is also another reason why SOC may
                    <br />
                    not be adequate for economy - the separation of time scales between
                    <br />
                    accumulation of stress in the system and its relaxation, which is several
                    <br />
                    orders of magnitude: in earthquakes, where the stress involved in the
                    <br />
                    movement of tectonic plates may take thousands of years while the earthquake
                    <br />
                    itself (the &quot;avalanche&quot;) takes only a few seconds. I don't see any such
                    <br />
                    parallel in economic dynamics, say, in the time scales that separate booms
                    <br />
                    from recessions. I have to confess that even before I realized the
                    <br />
                    &quot;institutional catch&quot; in SOC my initial sympathy for this theory was shaken
                    <br />
                    by works of Carson and Doyle on Highly Optimized Tolerance theory, which
                    <br />
                    stresses the importance of design in complex system and its inevitable
                    <br />
                    vulnerability to design flaws or rare unaccounted-for events.
                    <br />
                    I guess that you basic message was that a complex system like economy may
                    <br />
                    involve both aspects of SOC, internal design, and autoctalysis and that one
                    <br />
                    doese not exclude the other. I agree with that.
                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will attempt to reply to Igor's interesting posting, where he
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishes strongly between self-organization, SOC, and autocatalytic
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems, all of which, it seems to me could nevertheless be aspects of
                        any
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural system. So, my view is not to suggest that these different ideas
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; are related, but that they may all be modeling different aspects of some
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex dynamic material system, which, in addition, would necessarily --
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; if located somewhere -- be regulated by environmental conditions.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any natural dynamical system self-organizes, but only under the tutelage
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; current boundary conditions (some of which may be recursive upon the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; actions of the system). And some of these would be like the externalties

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical economics. As well, some of these, it seems to me, would be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; formally like the 'tunings' of economic systems, even though the latter
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been influenced by human projects and would emerge from within a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; system. As for being &quot;externally driven&quot;, such systems
                        often/?always
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; would
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; come into being as a result of environmental forcings.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self-organizing natural systems would undergo development, and would not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; become &quot;steady state&quot; until they reached that stage (I call it
                        maturity)
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; their development. SOC is observed when systems designed to show it reach
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if they do) steady state, ignoring the development of the system up
                        until
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; that time (which is often very rapid in the simple systems usually
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; examined). In some natural cases that development could have

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; autocatalytic
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties, which would be more likely to become salient in more
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated systems.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I guess my point is that all of these ideas could be applied to a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; single system. As in SOC, the system could be initited by some external

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; forcing (efficient cause). After being initiated, it might self-organize
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (based on material causes), and, if it has some duration and

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; autocatalysis (a formal cause) could feature in its development, as well
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; some kind of process of internal tuning via feedbacks on recursive
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraints if the system is complicated enough. Is a syncretic picture
