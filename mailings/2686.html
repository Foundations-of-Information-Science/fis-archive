11th FIS Discussion Session:
<br />
<p><p>INTRODUCING SOCIAL AND CULTURAL COMPLEXITY
<br />
<p>Joseph A. Tainter
<br />
<p>Global Institute of Sustainability and School of Human Evolution and Social 
<br />
Change,
<br />
Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA
<br />
<p><p>&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years ago I began a fruitful collaboration with 
<br />
Timothy Allen, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin and a leading 
<br />
thinker on hierarchy theory. Many stimulating discussions and several 
<br />
worthwhile products emerged from our work together, as well as a few 
<br />
surprises. One surprise was to find, after writing together for five years, 
<br />
that we meant different things by the term complexity. I suspect this kind 
<br />
of discovery is not unusual in interdisciplinary collaborations.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many kinds of complexity are there? Perhaps I should 
<br />
phrase that as: How many concepts of complexity are there? There are, to 
<br />
begin, social complexity and ecological complexity. There are algorithmic 
<br />
complexity and computational complexity. A simple foray into Wikipedia 
<br />
shows that computational complexity can be linear, logarithmic, or 
<br />
exponential. Complexity classes can be P or NP. There are complex systems, 
<br />
complex mechanisms, and complex behavior. Complexity can be specified, 
<br />
irreducible, or unruly. To some ecologists, complexity is equivalent to 
<br />
diversity, while to others complexity emerges through hierarchy (Allen and 
<br />
Starr 1982; Allen and Hoekstra 1992; Ahl and Allen 1996). Complexity can be 
<br />
hierarchical or heterarchical. Hierarchies can be simple and short, or 
<br />
complex and elaborate. Complexity can occur within a system, or by 
<br />
embedding types of systems. Organization in complex systems emerges through 
<br />
constraints, which can be asymmetrical (Allen, Tainter, and Hoekstra 1999; 
<br />
Allen et al. 2001) or symmetrical. Amidst all this conceptual fluorescence, 
<br />
the irony of complexity is that it simplifies. Elaboration of structure and 
<br />
organization simplifies behavior, making it possible for assemblages of 
<br />
entities to function as systems.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cut through the conceptual diversity by describing how 
<br />
many anthropologists, including myself, came to think of complexity. Two of 
<br />
history’s truisms are that most societies of today are more complex than 
<br />
those of our ancestors, and that at least since the end of the Pleistocene 
<br />
many societies have shown a seemingly inexorable tendency to increase in 
<br />
complexity. But of what does this complexity consist?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One essential feature of the least complex societies is that 
<br />
they show little differentiation in structure. There are few social roles 
<br />
except those arising immediately from gender, age, and personal abilities. 
<br />
Social and cultural complexity has meant, in part, the emergence of 
<br />
differentiated roles and institutions. Hunter-gatherer societies may 
<br />
contain no more than a few dozen distinct social personalities, while 
<br />
modern European censuses recognize 10,000 to 20,000 unique occupations, and 
<br />
industrial societies may contain overall more than 1,000,000 different 
<br />
types of personalities (McGuire 1983: 115).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this differentiation of structure all there is to social 
<br />
complexity? To conclude so would be like concluding that ecological 
<br />
complexity can be reduced to species diversity. Differentiation in 
<br />
structure is a useful starting point for understanding cultural complexity, 
<br />
but it is only the beginning. In western North America, anthropologists in 
<br />
the early 20th century compiled lists of “culture elements” among the 
<br />
remaining native peoples. It was not a very sophisticated approach. A 
<br />
culture element could be anything from the practice of a ritual to a 
<br />
kinship category, as if all such things were commensurate “elements.” But 
<br />
Julian Steward pointed out the quantitative contrast between the 3000 to 
<br />
6000 culture elements documented among the native people of western North 
<br />
America, and the 500,000 artifact types that U.S. military forces landed at 
<br />
Casablanca in 1942 (1955: 81). The figures give an indication of great 
<br />
difference in the complexity of these respective societies.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such enormous differentiation tells only part of the 
<br />
story. Complexity consists of organization as well as structural 
<br />
differentiation. The challenge of the logistical train that headed for the 
<br />
coast of northwest Africa was not just the great diversity in artifact 
<br />
types, but also how they were packed aboard ship. In proper combat loading, 
<br />
material should be stowed in reverse order from the sequence needed upon 
<br />
landing. No doubt the U.S. military understood this in principle, but 
<br />
failed to apply it in practice. Material cascaded into the docks 
<br />
chaotically, and was loaded onto ships haphazardly. Soldiers broke the 
<br />
windshields of stowed vehicles that they had to climb over to find items. 
<br />
Explosives wound up in passageways, staterooms, and troop holds. Needless 
<br />
to say, unloading under fire was chaotic. Guns arrived on the beach without 
<br />
gunsights, without ammunition, without gunners. Important radio equipment 
<br />
had been stored as ballast because it was heavy. Medical supplies remained 
<br />
on the ships for 36 critical hours (Atkinson 2002: 34-35, 138-139). To find 
<br />
any specific thing it was necessary to unload nearly everything.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the 500,000 artifact types shipped to 
<br />
Casablanca is that they did not, in fact, comprise a complex system. The 
<br />
system lacked organization. Differentiation in structure without 
<br />
corresponding organization makes a system complicated (Allen, Tainter, and 
<br />
Hoekstra 1999, 2003), not complex. In a complex system, certain elements 
<br />
constrain others, making the behavior of the constrained elements simple 
<br />
and predictable. This is the essence of the evolution of social and 
<br />
cultural complexity–differentiation in structure combined with organization 
<br />
that increases to constrain the structure (Tainter 1988). As a human system 
<br />
becomes elaborate and organized, the behavior of its individual 
<br />
elements–institutions, social roles, or just individual people–is channeled 
<br />
and simplified. Where once in human societies most people could perform 
<br />
most tasks, today specialization is the norm. Behavior is constrained and 
<br />
predictable.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what does human organization consist? Historians, working 
<br />
with the records of kings and governments, have tended to emphasize the 
<br />
evolution of one facet of organization, the social and political hierarchy. 
<br />
The essence of hierarchy is asymmetric relations, in which some elements 
<br />
constrain the behavior of others (Allen and Starr 1982). Certainly 
<br />
hierarchy is a salient kind of human organization, but it is not the only 
<br />
kind. In a human system, symmetric relations also constrain. Heterarchy is 
<br />
a kind of organization in which elements are unranked relative to each 
<br />
other, or can be ranked in a number of ways (Crumley 1979). The states 
<br />
comprising the European Union are a heterarchy, for they are in principle 
<br />
unranked, or ranked only temporarily. They constrain each other through 
<br />
symmetric relations. The emphasis and guiding principle is common policy. 
<br />
Hierarchy and heterarchy differ in the ways in which they integrate 
<br />
elements, the speed at which they can operate and reach decisions, and 
<br />
their effectiveness in various circumstances. The advantage of hierarchy is 
<br />
that it can act quickly, uniformly, and over a large area. Heterarchy is 
<br />
better suited to incorporating varieties of experience, but is slower to 
<br />
act. The two organizing principles each perform best in different 
<br />
circumstances (McIntosh, Tainter, and McIntosh 2000).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new area of investigation is how structure and organization 
<br />
emerge from the interactions of individuals. This is the basis of much of 
<br />
the work done in the area of agent-based modeling. The advent of 
<br />
telecommunications and electronic databases now allows social scientists to 
<br />
identify small social networks, and see the structures that emerge from 
<br />
them. Applied to the conflict in Iraq, researchers have employed 
<br />
regularities in the formation of networks to conclude that the number of 
<br />
contending factions has grown from 15 to 35 in 2003 to 100 to 130 today 
<br />
(Bohannon 2006).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in a human system, structure and organization emerge from 
<br />
top-down constraints, from the horizontal constraints of peers, and from 
<br />
the atomistic interactions of gregarious individuals. The intersection of 
<br />
these makes for the complicated, complex, confusing life that we all know, 
<br />
and through which daily we try to navigate.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was once thought that complex society–what we 
<br />
conventionally call “civilization”–emerged solely through human creativity, 
<br />
or from the availability of surplus energy provided by agriculture and 
<br />
fossil fuels. We now understand that this was naive: Complexity imposes 
<br />
costs, and humans are frequently averse to it. Human systems often increase 
<br />
in complexity through the mundane process of solving problems (Tainter 
<br />
2000, 2006; Allen, Tainter and Hoekstra 2003). As problems increase in 
<br />
scale and complexity (a phenomenon that is perhaps inevitable), problem 
<br />
solving efforts must complexify correspondingly. Often the solution to a 
<br />
problem is seen as differentiating structure (perhaps through technology or 
<br />
formal institutions) or as increasing organization (to further channel 
<br />
behavior). The best recent example is the response of the US government to 
<br />
the attacks of September 11, 2001. The governmental response was to 
<br />
increase structural differentiation, by forming new bureaus and rearranging 
<br />
existing ones, and to increase organization, in order to constrain behavior 
<br />
still further. The official commission convened to investigate the incident 
<br />
issued a thick report that recommended still more complexity in order to 
<br />
forestall possible future attacks.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of complex adaptive systems, there is (to use a 
<br />
colloquial expression) no free lunch. In any living system, complexity 
<br />
costs. Once structure and organization increase, a way must be found to pay 
<br />
for the increase. Complexity that emerges through problem solving typically 
<br />
increases prior to the energy (or other currency) that is required to fund 
<br />
it. Thus governments never have sufficient funds to pay for all necessary 
<br />
programs, and firms, families, and individuals must always make choices 
<br />
about which problems they will solve, and which they cannot afford to 
<br />
address. Complexity that emerges through problem solving is a benefit/cost 
<br />
function. It can enhance sustainability, but also undermine it (Tainter 
<br />
1988, 2000, 2006).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other concepts of complexity that can fruitfully be 
<br />
applied to human systems? Deliberately I refrain from undertaking to answer 
<br />
this question. Instead I pose it for our forum, in the hope that 
<br />
interesting and worthwhile discussions will emerge.
