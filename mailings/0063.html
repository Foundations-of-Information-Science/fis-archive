Contribution to the FIS discussion on information and physics !!! 
<br />
by Werner Ebeling:
<br />
<p>I studied with great interest  the points of view discussed so far,
<br />
with most of them I agree but not with all of them.
<br />
My points are related to Koichiros statements, to Jerrys comments
<br />
and to Pedros considerations.
<br />
<p>Let me summarize my points of view in brief: 
<br />
<p>A) On the relation between thermodynamical entropy and informational entropy:
<br />
<p>1. Information entropy is the more general concept. 
<br />
<p>2. Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy which has a thermodynamical meaning is obtained 
<br />
from Shannons formula, if a special state space (the phase space of coordinates
<br />
and momenta) is chosen.
<br />
<p>3. Information is a specific binary relation between
<br />
two systems, a 'sender' and a 'receiver'. Possibly one is the object and the 
<br />
other one is the observer (this is important in quantum mechanics).
<br />
<p>4. Information is a non-physical quantity. Information transfer is always 
<br />
connected with energy and entropy flows, the opposite is not true
<br />
Wiener is right: information cannot be reduced to
<br />
energy or entropy. 
<br />
<p>5. The quantitative aspect of the information transfer from
<br />
sender to receiver (not the pragmatic aspect, not the meaning !),
<br />
is measured by the transfer of entropy.            \\
<br />
<p>6. The amount of energy transfer in information-processing 
<br />
is in general not relevant, but there exist constraints from physics.
<br />
<p>7. Information flow is connected is with the decrease
<br />
of uncertainty about the state of a system, or the increase of the
<br />
predictability of a future state.
<br />
<p>8. The possibility to convert informational entropy into thermodynamic 
<br />
entropy has been shown in fact already by Maxwell and by Szilard
<br />
<p>B) Properties of information and relation between information and life
<br />
<p>1. Information can have two basic forms: 
<br />
- free information, is what is transferred betweem sender and receiver, 
<br />
- bound information, is a structure which is an actual or potential 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;information carrier.
<br />
<p>2. Bound information is always connected with with a definite material
<br />
structure as e.g. DNA, free information is abstract/symbolic. Free information
<br />
is to a high degree independent from the carrier}.
<br />
<p>3. Free information is connected with meaning and with goals (Zweck).
<br />
This is the pragmatic aspect of information processing.
<br />
<p>4. Information can be created by selforganization, it has been
<br />
created in the evolution of life.
<br />
<p>5. There is no life without information-processing. Information-processing
<br />
is a 'conditio sine qua non' for life. Life stars with the ability to 
<br />
create, to process, to store and to transfer free information.
<br />
<p>6. Information-processing systems are either directly bound to life
<br />
or they are indirectly connected with living systems, being generated by
<br />
living systems.
<br />
<p>7. In course of evolution several 'phase transitions' from
<br />
bound to free information are observed.
<br />
<p>8. The semantic and the pragmatic side of the information
<br />
are the most relevant aspects. Meaning and `Zweck' is, what really matters. 
<br />
However this does not mean, that the other sides (as e.g. the entropy
<br />
aspect) do not exist. For physicists is important, that this side 
<br />
can be described quantitatively.
