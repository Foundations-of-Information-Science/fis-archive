                <p>
                    Dear Pedro and Bob:
                    <br />
                <p>This email responds to Pedro's comments which are reproduced below and indirectly to Bob's work -
                    which I both admire and question because he invokes the superiority of mathematical symbols across
                    multiple symbol systems..
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Let me attempt to explain this point of view.
                    <br />
                <p>Human communication of information, as I understand it, is grounded in the notion that messages can
                    be encoded, transferred, decoded such that the exact message originating in the mind of one
                    individual can be transferred to the mind of another individual. Thus, the symbols, 2+2 = 4 are
                    understood by readers.
                    <br />
                <p>To that end, we have created and deployed several different symbol systems, each with its particular
                    operating characteristics. What are the logical properties of these DIFFERENT symbol systems?
                    <br />
                <p>Each symbol system has its own particular set of logical relations that are intrinsic to its
                    operations. Of these these symbol systems, the alphabetic system, the natural languages, may be the
                    oldest. However, it is intimately intertwined with numbers and arithmetic operations in practice.
                    So, natural language and mathematics are both ancient.
                    <br />
                <p>Yet, the classical logic is remote from the logic of mathematics, which can appear in a wide array of
                    forms. Because mathematicians take the time to carefully define their words, they can be tolerant of
                    a wide range of logical systems, even topoi!
                    <br />
                <p>The chemists have also developed a symbol system. neither the classical logic nor the logics of
                    mathematicians is sufficient to describe chemical relations. In order to accommodate the unique
                    character of each chemical elements, chemical logic developed very slowly and was, originally,
                    closely related to smelting and the metals, ie the bronze age. Only in the 20 th Century did
                    chemical logic establish itself as a derivative of the numbers, the atomic numbers and relations
                    among them.
                    <br />
                <p>Of course, the musical notation system is another system of logic which developed slowly. Like the
                    logic of chemistry, its ancient origins sustained a slow development over many centuries.
                    <br />
                    It differs from alphabetic, arithmetic, and chemical logic and notation.
                    <br />
                <p>Money is another symbol system.
                    <br />
                    Time may also be thought of as a symbol system.
                    <br />
                <p>Such symbol systems are part, a portion, a partition, of human communication capabilities - we also
                    have sensory systems, don't we? Indeed, we can view synthetic symbol systems as mere augmentations
                    to our animate sensory systems.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, with this information about a particular view of the history of human communication as
                    background, I turn to Pedro's post.
                    <br />
                <p>Date: May 27, 2005 8:45:28 AM EDT
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;Dear All,
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>snip
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;Integration is not just the opposite of reduction, but it may be taken as another denomination
                    for the untractable mutidisciplinary / consilience problem.
                    <br />
                <p>JLRC:
                    <br />
                    Agreed.
                    <br />
                    Integration for the individual human being must not be confused with mathematical symbols.
                    <br />
                    Typically, an individual must integrate over various symbols systems, each with a possibly different
                    set of premisses and operations.
                    <br />
                <p>For example, the premisses of chemistry and the operations of chemical reactions use a logic that is
                    remote from model theory of mathematical logic. Several years of effort are required to learn how to
                    translate between the symbol system of mathematics and the symbol system of chemistry. ( I offer a
                    simple problem that demonstrates what I mean. Why is it that chemical formula are excluded from
                    chemical thermodynamics?)
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro:
                    <br />
                    Several parties in this list have advocated systemic views (Stan a number of times!, Jerry also
                    produced a vast systemic scheme). However, arguing seriously about systems theory, after the
                    pioneering views of von Bertalanffy in the 60's, very little has been produced under the guidance of
                    that school, and I really contend that, concerning the integration problem, anything but triviality
                    and self-delusion can be found around the 'level' stuff nowadays.
                    <br />
                <p>JLRC:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;On the contrary, I would say that systems theory is so successful that it has been widely
                    adapted in many many disciplines. For example, the practice of medicine has covertly adopted system
                    theory and a system's approach in 'outcome - based' practice. Systems terminology is intrinsic to
                    genomics, engineering, etc etc etc. Is your real concern coherence within a symbol system or among
                    symbol systems?
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;The lack of appropriate metaphors to be handled in front of the apparent naturality of the
                    mechanistic and also of the &quot;systemic&quot; or &quot;holistic&quot; complex of thought
                    (composition and decomposition by manual operations upon objects and their parts) is part of the
                    missing informational conceptualization too.
                    <br />
                <p>JLRC
                    <br />
                    Why metaphors?
                    <br />
                    Why not logical translations?
                    <br />
                    For example, the logic of clinical decision making is often based on excess or deficiency of
                    chemical components of the body. Clinicians look for ways to either increase or decrease the amounts
                    of particular chemicals so as to re-establish normalized values.
                    <br />
                    Why should we consider this to be informational metaphor when the logic is developed from a semiotic
                    perspective?
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro:
                    <br />
                    So, discussing in depth the series of bio-economic metaphors raised by Aleks would be quite
                    interesting (impossible here, but just as a detail, the ATP is presented as 'currency' in most
                    textbooks: wrong, at is just pure 'fuel'; the only cellular currency may be established around
                    &quot;second messengers&quot; cAMP, Ca++, cGMP, etc.).
                    <br />
                <p>JLRC
                    <br />
                    As a part of human communication, Alex's narrative is grounded in at two different systems of logic
                    and perhaps three or four. In particular, I ask myself how should the informed nature of metabolism
                    be translated into the informed nature of energy / fuel?
                    <br />
                    Alex could provide us with the logics of his narrative so that we can examine them by the usual
                    methods of science.
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro:
                    <br />
                    In general I accept the difficulty on pointing at any clear-and-cut info metaphor to be presented as
                    an alternative to those seductive images from reductionism &amp; mechanism and pseudo-holism...
                    Shouldn't we plan some devoted work on advancing in this metaphorical aspect too?
                    <br />
                <p>JLRC
                    <br />
                    The natural sciences are generally viewed as being related to prediction.
                    <br />
                    The natural sciences are generally viewed as being based on logical communication of results among
                    individuals such that we can address the profound issue of reproducibility.
                    <br />
                    Why should we reduce our standards of consistency and prediction and reproducibility?
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;Finally, my past message trying to &quot;nail&quot; down a metaphor on value within social
                    networks, may be formulated more succinctly as follows: when the social value of some object gets
                    &quot;measured&quot; as a price, what we collectively perform is an estimation of the capability of
                    that object to promote &quot;formation of social structures&quot; around itself...
                    <br />
                <p>At present, science is working on chemical networks, biochemical networks, and the implications for
                    higher systems. Given the complexity of these networks I expect it will be several decades before a
                    substantial approach to social networks will be developed. One potent difficulty, in addition to the
                    intractable mathematics, is the indivisibility of the individual, yet, at the same time, the
                    individual can demonstrate enormous sensitivity to conditions as a consequence of memory and
                    organization. Since it is already clear that we need a special mathematics for chemistry, I suspect
                    we will need a very special mathematics of individuals systems for the creation of memory within a
                    biochemical / biological system (which is Soren's point, if I understand him correctly.).
                    <br />
                <p>We may have to evolve entire new symbol systems in order to tackle such problems. Such a task is
                    daunting but it is better to face the reality of our situation than to mislead our supporters about
                    our capabilities.
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro continues (the browser accidently deleted the &quot;quotation markers):
                    <br />
                <p>Perhaps sort of a middle road between Bob's and Karl's views (could multidimensional partitions as
                    descriptors of social nets complexity provide a complement to the current conceptualization of
                    ascendancy?). Then, a pressing issue to consider in this tentative revision of social ascendancy may
                    be that social information is very largely &quot;decoupled&quot; from entropy growth (as biological
                    information itself). An additional problem concerning Karl's partitional approach is that he has not
                    developed a consistent methodology yet---and the attempts made by me and Morris a few years ago,
                    produced contradictory results with him. So I friendly depart from his views when he heuristically
                    establishes the number of multidimensional partitions.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;Today seems to be my disagreement day: Lots of stuff to discuss in Paris!
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;regards
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;Pedro
                    <br />
                <p>In short, I view the concept of information as part of human communication and specialized to various
                    symbol systems in various stages of a long historical development. Each symbol system uses a
                    different encoding, decoding and logical systems. The widely used narrative that presupposes that
                    all human communication can be framed within a single linear stream of alphabetic symbols and a
                    single system of logic seems to me not to be a fruitful approach. It fails for transmission of
                    biochemical information (structural and optical isomers) and if it fails for relatively simple
                    chemical systems, it certainly fails for biological systems based on the genetic code.
                    <br />
                <p>Despite the relatively pessimistic tone of this message, I do think that we are making progress on
                    conceptualizing human communication. Despite this bit of optimism, I wonder if social evolution is
                    not progressing faster than the growth of our understanding of human communication.
                    <br />
                <p>It also seems to me that the philosophers of both the European and the Anglo-American schools have a
                    lot more work ahead of them than the current (dogmatic?) philosophies of the science of information
                    suggest.
                    <br />
