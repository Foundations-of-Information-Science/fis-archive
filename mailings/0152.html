I appreciated your reply fully. Rather than deepening differences between
<br />
our approaches - which even may not be as deep as you presumed in your
<br />
reply- I would like to stick to an issue we both are trying to deal with:
<br />
Interaction and Communication.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are both recognizing that when a fluctuation within a society alters its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;internal relations it also alters the society*s relations with the
</em><br />
external
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world.  Both alterations will affect social roles played by individuals,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which will threaten and confuse some and lead many to resist.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeed entropy.
</em><br />
<p>OK, but some others may nnot be &quot;treatened and confused&quot;, but rother
<br />
pleasured by the change of roles to play. So there will be also
<br />
information-energy and not only entropy. Shurely, we know that a lot of
<br />
changed behaviour appears, but most of them has never been selected (that4s
<br />
what frustrated people who modified their roles, isnt it?)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I am not denying there are internal sources of evolutionary change but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;merely stating what I think is now a platitude--that there is an entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;price to pay for it.
</em><br />
<p>Please, look also on anatropic (&quot;constructive&quot;) behaviour, where the
<br />
&quot;price&quot; for change is payed by (&quot;rewarding&quot;) information-energy.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you will accept that [platitude], then we can bring back the Idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Progress, give meaning to history, and support an Enlightenment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ideal*without being blind to costs (entropy) or naive about expectations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(no guarantees variations will produce more humane realities).
</em><br />
<p>Accepted. But even if variations dont guaranty, they are the &quot;source&quot; of
<br />
social evolution (see my contribution to fis-vienna, &quot;The role of
<br />
variety...&quot;, in World Futures 97).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;....the argument is that we not assume a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fully developed human self, consciousness, mind, etc is just plain given.
</em><br />
<p>Thats clear. But, drawing the consequences, we may not more insist in
<br />
explaining what human behaviour, mind, self etc &quot;is&quot;, because it does not
<br />
&quot;be&quot; (ger: sein), but rather try to explain how and why it changes,
<br />
devellops, progresses etc., how it &quot;becomes or gets&quot; (ger: werden).
<br />
Maybe the differences sound just semantic. But I thing, that in order to
<br />
explain social phase changes (right now ocurring globally), we shuld rather
<br />
give the accent to change-fenomena than to order-questions.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...So information is about something, in this case the context in which a
</em><br />
society is &gt;embedded.
<br />
<p>I still agree. But look at what is saied: the context of society! We dont
<br />
talk about people or persons that live in a social context. We talk about
<br />
societies in a whatsoever context! And what is that context? For persons we
<br />
know the context or environment is a social one. And for social systems? I
<br />
think that there is a informational environment (on &quot;top&quot;), and a
<br />
psicological environment (on &quot;bottom&quot;). Do you see so?
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I do not imagine that information is sitting *out there* in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Platonic world waiting to be discovered.  If the world is truly dynamic
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolving, then information is created.
</em><br />
<p>You explain here, that info is created by social dynamics. I agree. But
<br />
that does not hinder, that info is in social systems environment too.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;.... I argued social roles store or record information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather than saying they are made of it.  And it is important to me that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information is social what is stored in a role is not just what an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual knows but what the society in which the individual acts knows.
</em><br />
<p>OK, lets say society knows and  store this knowledge in roles (instituions,
<br />
VEMs etc.). I dont have any problem with that. I just emphasized on the
<br />
storage-method used by society, and called in &quot;communication&quot; or
<br />
&quot;interaction&quot;. Doing so, I dont eliminate roles etc., but rather am able to
<br />
explain how they are constructed, created, &quot;built&quot;. Thats because sociology
<br />
may also be interested in deconscruct, deteriorate, &quot;destroy&quot; things not
<br />
desireable.
<br />
Even here, differences sound semantic. Although roles &quot;store&quot; information,
<br />
that storage is not that one of the computers hard disk. Its the storage of
<br />
a complex chaning beeing, called social role. So if roles &quot;store&quot;, they
<br />
&quot;process&quot; in fact information. If this happens self-organized, we may speek
<br />
of &quot;construction&quot;, dont we?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...Gottfried and I seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be led to different conclusions about what the *stuff* of societies is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I bent mine [mind] by saying to myself if societies are real they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must be made of something; if they are made from human beings the
</em><br />
something
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of which societies are made must be their interactions;
</em><br />
<p>If the are made by interactions (I agree), they cannot be made at the same
<br />
time by human beeings. Please explain!
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;if interactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make a difference and create information then relations between humans
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affect what they do; if behavior matters in this circumstance it must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because what individual humans do is correlated*people act as if they know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what one another are doing.
</em><br />
<p>Shurely, behaviour matters, but its social behavoiour rather than
<br />
individual one. Once again: we are not trying to explain individual
<br />
behaviour socially conditioned, but social behaviour conditioned by
<br />
information-flows.
<br />
There are two different levels of observation, are there?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, again, it is reduced uncertainty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about a world changed by interactions.
</em><br />
<p>Thats what it is.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why would we do that [something]?  Because by our collective actions we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;created*not discovered*a new world, a world in which selection acts on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whole rather than directly on the parts.  Thus, I think it is these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interactions and their combined effects which release environmental matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and energy flows processed by correlated behaviors that constitute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;societies.
</em><br />
<p>Constituion of society by selected acts and interactions. OK. These are
<br />
stored in social facts (roles, values etc.), to be reproduced, copied etc.
<br />
Its not the person that &quot;interacts&quot; with other persons, its a reality of
<br />
interaction communicating with social roles.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not easy to see behavior as stuff, for our Western minds have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;habituated to more materialistic perceptions.  But if there is a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientific paradigm here we need to bend our minds to see things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differently.
</em><br />
<p>No problem to see it as &quot;stuff&quot;, as &quot;social matter&quot; if you want. But this
<br />
matter is reflexive, it deliberates, it reacts  and acts upon social
<br />
stimuli. Its not the stuff of the Rocky Mountains, as you will agree.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Individuals, however, need tools for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anticipating how to choose between behavioral options.  One tool is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;slave-driver*s lash.  But another with more long-term benefits for
</em><br />
everyone
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is Values, Ethics, and Morals (VEMs).  For me, they map the roles and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relations constituting societies, as, I think, DNA maps the roles and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relations constituting organisms.
</em><br />
<p>No doubt and conceded. But again here you try &quot;only&quot; to explain individual
<br />
behaviour by anticipating options. Staying on this explication-level, VEMs
<br />
may be more to DNA. But, &quot;beneath&quot; DNA, there are information codes which
<br />
replicate, which is a sort of interaction. I meen, its on that level that
<br />
we can explain real social behaviour, the behaviour not of individuals but
<br />
of entire social systems.
<br />
Shurely, we may extend the roles-approach also to them. The role of
<br />
government, family etc. But thats not the same as the social role of a
<br />
person (President, mother etc.). Presidents and mothers are not the
<br />
government or the family, they are just &quot;human beeings&quot;, as history reveals
<br />
in our times.
<br />
So, how to explain the role of collectivities? That can not be done by
<br />
explaining the social roles its members play, but by the interaction of
<br />
that roles, by a communication-process called social system.
