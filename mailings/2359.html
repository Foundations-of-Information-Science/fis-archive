<p>----------------------------------------------
<br />
<p><p>Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>Our next topic is information ethics. We suggest to discuss first the 
<br />
matter of ethics and then go into the specific ethical questions raised 
<br />
particularly by modern information technology.
<br />
<p>Ethics is, like any other field of scientific and philosophic research, not 
<br />
only controversial concerning its methodology and goals but also concerning 
<br />
its very nature. Philosophers have been developing ethical theories for 
<br />
thousands of years in different cultures. One starting point for our 
<br />
discussions could be the difference between &quot;life&quot; in a biological sense 
<br />
and &quot;life&quot; or &quot;human existence&quot;. This difference was basic in Greek 
<br />
philosophy. The ancient Greek used two different words for life, namely 
<br />
&quot;zoe&quot; and &quot;bios&quot;. Ethics is basically about &quot;bios,&quot; i.e., about the 
<br />
'design' of human existence or of the place where we live (&quot;ethos&quot;). This 
<br />
presupposes that we do not only live within open possibilities (this is the 
<br />
case of other living beings too), but that we are aware of them. In classic 
<br />
terms, this is the question of freedom in the sense not only of freedom 
<br />
&quot;from&quot; but of freedom &quot;for&quot;. But things are of course more complex, since 
<br />
we are not only living beings in the sense of &quot;bios&quot; but also of &quot;zoe&quot; so 
<br />
that our options for &quot;good life&quot; are intertwined with the possibilities 
<br />
given by nature as well as with the ones we artificially create by ourselves.
<br />
<p>Ethical questions concern then:
<br />
- what does it mean to set rules for regulating our possibilities of action 
<br />
in order have &quot;good life&quot; (Aristotle9),
<br />
- how such rules have been developed and applied (for better for worse) so 
<br />
far,
<br />
- how can they be changed,
<br />
- how can they collide or not with natural laws.
<br />
<p>We usually make a difference between ethics and morality, where ethics (or 
<br />
&quot;techne ethiké&quot;) is the science of morals (&quot;ethos&quot;), morals being the 
<br />
phenomenon we study. This is an important difference because in normal life 
<br />
people use both words (and even both concepts!) as synonyms. It is also 
<br />
important to grasp ethics as the place where morality can be 
<br />
(theoretically) questioned. In other words, an ethical discussion arises 
<br />
when given moral laws governing our behavior are not any more obvious.
<br />
<p>As you know, Kant suggested that moral laws should be conceived in analogy 
<br />
to natural laws from a formal standpoint. Kant also made a strong 
<br />
difference between human beings as far as they belong to nature and as far 
<br />
as they are &quot;ends in themselves.&quot; These (and other) Kantian are part of our 
<br />
Western culture, including our legal norms. They were Kant's answer to 
<br />
Newton, i.e., to a universe conceived as deterministic in which there was 
<br />
no place for freedom. We have not a similar fundamental philosophic answer 
<br />
to modern science (evolution, quantum physics, molecular biology etc.). So, 
<br />
our suggestion is to start discussing this matter.
<br />
<p>Honoring the tradition started in this list by Peter Erdi, quite many 
<br />
discussions ago, we formulate the following questions:
<br />
<p>Q1. What is the philosophic and ethical challenge of the physical, 
<br />
chemical, biological... sciences today with regard to human freedom and the 
<br />
'laws' (?) that should regulate our actions? What is the meaning of 
<br />
'natural law' today and can we take it as an analogy (?) in the field of 
<br />
morality? are there other alternatives?
<br />
<p>Q2. What is the philosophic and ethical challenge of modern information 
<br />
technology with regard to human freedom? How far do we conceive the 
<br />
'cyberspace' or, more generally speaking, the potential digitization of all 
<br />
phenomena (human and non human) as a (the?) condition for understanding 
<br />
them, and what does this mean with regard to human behavior? More 
<br />
specifically: do we conceive ourselves eventually as information processing 
<br />
devices?, and if yes, what follows with regard to artificial digital 
<br />
devices that we are creating now and in the future?
<br />
<p>Q3. What does it mean for human beings to be able to behave in a global 
<br />
digital world in which time and space seem to disappear? What are the 
<br />
consequences of our doing for the whole planet? How can we create rules of 
<br />
action that are accepted by all human beings in order to achieve a global 
<br />
sustainable (physical and cultural and economic...) development without 
<br />
deleting all differences that makes human life worth living?
<br />
<p><p>On a second step we can switch into Information Ethics. The recent history 
<br />
of information ethics arises as a process of problematization of behavioral 
<br />
norms of communication in societies shaped by mass media particularly since 
<br />
the second half of the last century. This situation took a dramatic twist 
<br />
with the rise of the Internet as a horizontal or non-hierarchic, 
<br />
interactive and global medium for message production, storage, 
<br />
distribution, and exchange.
<br />
<p>Information ethics understood in a narrower sense deals with ethical 
<br />
questions of the Internet. It arises because this new medium created 
<br />
problems that could not be solved on the basis of traditional rules and 
<br />
roles of hierarchical generation, distribution, storage and exchange of 
<br />
messages under the premises of mass media in democratic societies. What do 
<br />
truth telling mean in this new situation? We ask this question when we 
<br />
debate for instance about privacy. What can I say to whom?  In which 
<br />
medium? A book, a newspaper, the TV, the radio, a blog, a mailing list, a 
<br />
personal e-mail?
<br />
<p>But the question underlying information ethics is, I believe, of a broader 
<br />
nature than the problems generated by the Internet. In this broader sense 
<br />
information ethics deals with questions of the digitalization, i.e., the 
<br />
reconstruction of all possible phenomena in the world as digital 
<br />
information and the problems caused by their exchange, combination and 
<br />
utilization. More on this at: <a href="../../www.capurro.de/oxford.html">http://www.capurro.de/oxford.html</a>
<br />
<p>You will find a comprehensive view of the field (including bibliography, 
<br />
etc.) at the website of the International Center for Information Ethics at 
<br />

<br />
Some specific questions for our discussion could be:
<br />
<p>Q4. What does it mean that knowledge should be free? is it only a problem 
<br />
of freedom of access? And what does it mean for scientific communication? 
<br />
How does this principle collide with, for instance, the economic principles 
<br />
underlying a market economy?
<br />
<p>Q5. What does it mean that not only information distributed in a 
<br />
one-to-many structure (like the case of the mass media of the 20th century) 
<br />
but also that everybody is able to communicate with everybody including 
<br />
also the possibilities of one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, 
<br />
some-to-many? Are there ethical and legal regulations for this process? If 
<br />
legal regulations presuppose central power and this is not desirable at a 
<br />
global level, what are the alternatives? Can we learn from nature in this 
<br />
regard? and if yes, how far?
<br />
<p><p>We are pleased to moderate this discussion.
<br />
<p>kind regards,
<br />
<p>Rafael Capurro
