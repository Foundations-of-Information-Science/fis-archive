<p>
Dear colleagues, friends and congeners,
<br />
<p>Forgive me, at least for a short while, that I take the liberty of 
<br />
assuming that all of us may and even must be aware about the causal 
<br />
evolvement of the so-called «WORLD ORDER», which has become the main 
<br />
feature of the civilized civilization during the last century, until 
<br />
today. This «ORDER» has been determined for being a rational 
<br />
arrangement of rights and duties of nations, attained usually through 
<br />
different kinds of warfare, which were decorated from time to time by 
<br />
armistices, arbitration, treaties,... accomplished by means of only 
<br />
few times real negotiations, though always loudly announced as 
<br />
diplomatic transactions.
<br />
<p>In fact this «ORDER» has been always, until 2003, what the Big 
<br />
Brothers democratically suggest and compulsorily propose to the small 
<br />
ones, who are forcibly invited to cooperate for the sake of human 
<br />
progress. It aims at determining what the geographical borders and 
<br />
economic boundaries of every nation should be and even how their 
<br />
respective citizenry should determine their individual interests, 
<br />
motivations and possibilities in order to contribute collectively to 
<br />
functionally maintain the «WORLD ORDER».
<br />
<p>I dare to argue that the better knowledge of how this ordering has 
<br />
arisen and evolved and how it has been implemented may today help any 
<br />
human to determine whether he or she accepts happily or resignedly or 
<br />
even stoically to adapt his or her personal behavior to options 
<br />
offered. One dramatic example of such a kind of adaptable behavior 
<br />
was the set of actions carried out by those about to die in the 
<br />
gladiatorial circus arenas who still managed to say &quot;Ave Caesar, 
<br />
morituri te salutant !&quot;. Immensely more dramatic, tragic in fact, is 
<br />
the situation at present of people of Iraq who will search how to 
<br />
survive after being liberated by means of ultra modern bombing, 
<br />
democratically oriented for Peace sake.
<br />
<p>Instead of learning to play a passive role this ordering may 
<br />
encourage non-malleable humans to be reliable rebels willing to act 
<br />
as revolutionary dissidents for searching a feasible way forward for 
<br />
humankind. To build such an unknown way, from now onward, is a very 
<br />
complex task that cannot be accomplished by national and 
<br />
international insurgents who were assuming that one or another of the 
<br />
various ideologies available would be suitable enough as a conducting 
<br />
criterion.
<br />
<p>The rebellion of conscious insurgents against the intended «WORLD 
<br />
ORDER» that has been conceived during the last decades has become 
<br />
urgently necessary, hopefully inevitable, due to the assumption that 
<br />
it has become indispensable the World Government cleverly devised and 
<br />
rationally designed by the Biggest Brother of the world citizenry.
<br />
<p>Such a rebellion may be considered de facto the real challenge for 
<br />
the scientific and academic community in the Third millennium that 
<br />
might finish with only those few humans who could survive the 
<br />
man-made apocalypse (I am convinced that few women have effectively 
<br />
contribute to make it feasible). Science, technology and education 
<br />
developed according to possibilities offered by the self-organized 
<br />
OPEN SYSTEM conditioned by ethical, ethological, biological and 
<br />
ecological criteria in the domain of every human concern may still be 
<br />
the way of increasing the survival chances of Homo sapiens sapiens by 
<br />
means of humanitarian procedures, rationally implemented.
<br />
<p>This rebellion indispensably needs the holistic comprehension of the 
<br />
crisis generated by the same ordering of human concerns. It is an 
<br />
enormous task whose complexity requires the participation of all the 
<br />
members of the scientific and academic community (being excluded 
<br />
those engaged in making more weapons for massive annihilation) in 
<br />
interdisciplinary endeavors through the Systems Thinking proposed by 
<br />
Ludwig von Bertalanffy as a Top Ë Down approach.
<br />
<p>Anyhow, I dare to ask your permission to send you some short messages 
<br />
about the «WORLD ORDER» that so far has become the main source of the 
<br />
most serious crisis ever faced by humankind.
