<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>I was preparing a posting when Andrei's message has arrived. I very much
<br />
like his summary, and am joining Karl and him along that path. My only
<br />
additional suggestion is the need for a parallel track of info research on
<br />
empirical grounds (firms, brains, cells...). Having said that I continue
<br />
with a few further themes that I would like to hear about, not necessarily
<br />
now, maybe in future discussions.
<br />
<p>1. ENTERING THE OBSERVER. In most branches of science the observer is left
<br />
out the picture (eg, mechanics, Shanon's communication theor., economics)
<br />
notwithstanding the curious, and very different, idealized properties
<br />
he/she may be endowed. But in info science the observer intrudes into the
<br />
picture quite crudely (e.g., meaning)... and so the mess. My contention is
<br />
that if he/she enters with the usual, idealized properties, it means the
<br />
end of the interesting business ­the different reductionist approaches to
<br />
info finally win the day. But if the observer is admitted within sort of a
<br />
'limited prehension' framework (superseding the 'principle of rationality'
<br />
so dear for physicists--Anderson, Gell-Mann), a few curious consequences
<br />
may follow. I have briefly explored this issue regarding the info dynamics
<br />
of the sciences and the emergence of interdisciplinary overlappings,
<br />
somehow it becomes an expansion on what is contemporarily called in AI &amp; AL
<br />
'swarm intelligence', or a new version of Ortega y Gasset's
<br />
perspectivism...  I was reminded the theme by some recent comments (Gyuri
<br />
and Juan) about info and the limitations of the observer in physics itself,
<br />
and by Koichiro's comments on book-keeping. But apart from us, limited
<br />
human observers, at least another couple of paradigmatic observers have to
<br />
enter into the info science picture: cells and firms... Economist
<br />
Schumpeter 'creative destruction' in economic systems becomes quite an
<br />
interesting piece of reflection about the structural peculiarities inherent
<br />
in these informational observers.
<br />
<p>THE STATUS OF NATURAL LAW. One of the problems I have for a meaningful link
<br />
of my own bio-inspired info views with physics (and with realism), derive
<br />
from the 'nature' of natural law. I bluntly summarize: the structural
<br />
state-info interacts with the boundary conditions via e.g. differential
<br />
equations that interconnect the mutual 'force' parameters (mass for
<br />
gravitation and inertia, electric charge, etc.). At least we have particles
<br />
and waves to visualize the existentiality of the state, but close to
<br />
nothing about the Law ­it is just a naked mathematical expression, floating
<br />
everywhere in emptiness. Thus, where could we situate the set of natural
<br />
laws, its realistic 'seat' into space­time? And how could we depict its
<br />
mechanistic or existential 'texture' in relation with the vividness of the
<br />
state info and the force concept (undoubtedly, crucial for the popular
<br />
explanatory appeal of mechanics)? The way natural Law is handled by
<br />
realists implies for me a dualistic-Platonic scheme... The 'it from bit'
<br />
views could suggest, at least, a partial  'genomic' parallel with the
<br />
structural, generative &amp; communicational info flavors I  distinguish for
<br />
the bio, neuro and economic entities 'always in the making'. (I would
<br />
appreciate responses from physicists, but not exactly re-stating my simple
<br />
mechanical picture into quantum mechanics or quantum field terms)
<br />
<p>MOLECULAR RECOGNITION (addressed to Shu-Kun and Andrei): So many info
<br />
processes in bio &amp; neuro realms are depending on molecular items
<br />
'recognizing' with almost complete specificity the forms and properties of
<br />
other molecules within an exquisitely-gauged affinity: enzymes, receptors,
<br />
channels, transcription factors, antibodies, signaling complexes,
<br />
ribosomes, proteasomes... I would further say that molecular recognition is
<br />
but the whole 'bread and butter' of life. However there is very few
<br />
theoretical discussion, at least in biology, on the basis of this crucial
<br />
property underlying biomolecular specificity and affinity. Does the
<br />
molecular recognition of motifs depend on classical effects (coulomb,
<br />
electroweak forces?); or do we need to go to the quantum? My superficial
<br />
knowledge on the topic says that, for instance 'molecular machines'
<br />
(Schneider) basically goes for the classic (and Shannonian), while the
<br />
non-demolition measurement approach (Andrei) points to the quantum.
<br />
Besides, Shu-Kun applies, in relation with the germane molecular-similarity
<br />
theme, quite an intriguing array of molecular statistical concepts ­it is
<br />
in this context where the 'L' concept has to be meaningfully situated?
<br />
<p>Bye fisers, have a good weekend.
<br />

<p>PS. Thanks to those who have welcome the two postings per week
<br />
self-discipline. It belongs to our chairs to announce the rule as
<br />
compulsory when needed. Technically, CPD (a funny new acronym: Compulsive
<br />
Posting Disorder) creates some troubles in the management of our list.
