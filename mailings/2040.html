                <p>
                    Dear Stan and others
                    <br />
                <p>It is important to notice that Aristotle's final course was thought into a
                    <br />
                    worldview where everything had its natural place and over a lifetime would
                    <br />
                    develop from potentiality to actuality and fulfill that place. The purpose
                    <br />
                    was to fulfill you place in this Cosmos, which had always been like this -
                    <br />
                    moved by the immovable mover who had also given his rationality to the
                    <br />
                    humans, so they by induction could recognize the order of things. Now Peirce
                    <br />
                    is able to take over this point of view in his evolutionary semiotic,
                    <br />
                    hylozoist view of the world. I a Peircean pan semiotics it is the pure
                    <br />
                    feeling that through evolutionary love manifests as life and mind at the
                    <br />
                    same time as the universe is moving towards a state of frozen structure. So,
                    <br />
                    here the drive towards heat death creates structures that carry life and
                    <br />
                    consciousness and therefore love - as I interpret him. As the energy is
                    <br />
                    converted to entropy, evolution and the universe will come to a hold.
                    <br />
                <p>What confuses me about Stan's answers is that he on one hand say and writes
                    <br />
                    that he is a pansemiotist and on the other hand speak of thermodynamics as
                    <br />
                    if he was a physicalist. From a physicalist's point of view it does not make
                    <br />
                    sense to speak of a final course outside living beings - for many of them
                    <br />
                    not even with animals. Some even do not believe in free will or that out
                    <br />
                    self-consciousness has any causal influence on the material world.
                    <br />
                <p>I cannot see, Stan, how you can say that the heat dead of the universe is it
                    <br />
                    purpose or final cause?
                    <br />
                <p>I am then disturbed by, that we come to humans you just say that there are
                    <br />
                    plenty of meanings of the meaning of life and the universe. But they are
                    <br />
                    subjective, cultural and often superstitious constructions and many of the
                    <br />
                    are contradictory? What kind of argument is that? I fail to see a consistent
                    <br />
                    view point in what you say. It confuses me, as we in many ways have the same
                    <br />
                    basic philosophies.
                    <br />
                <p>In the line of Peirce's work I see both science, philosophy and religion -
                    <br />
                    even politics - working on the understanding of reality and life - trying to
                    <br />
                    get them to make sense. It sure does not now - and the various symbolic
                    <br />
                    generalized medias (as Luhmann calls them) does not interact and corporate
                    <br />
                    very much. We have instead a growth in fundamentalistic views in both
                    <br />
                    religion, politics and science, which I agree threatens to bring the world
                    <br />
                    to horrible wars again.
                    <br />
                <p>But exactly the problem of if material growth is the answer to the problem
                    <br />
                    of survival and happiness has been discussed between the church and
                    <br />
                    politicians plus economists and lately be the environmentalists from the
                    <br />
                    idea of scarcity of resources and deeper purposes of human life. Also if the
                    <br />
                    meaning is just to be as many living humans here as possible or there is a
                    <br />
                    deep quality to human life - like enlightenment in some form. What would be
                    <br />
                    the broadest common good? It is one of the most important discussions going
                    <br />
                    on now.
                    <br />
                <p>My problem is if we can ever know from a common philosophy of science point
                    <br />
                    of view, which some of you now turn into an internalist philosophy. To me it
                    <br />
                    is just basic epistemology. It may indicate that final goals has to found in
                    <br />
                    the emotional and spiritual realm, not in the scientific and political.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>As usua,l Aleks has presented us with a splendid analysis. I will comment
                    <br />
                    on a few points without really objecting to anything:
                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Given that (because of its accelerated expansion) the Universe is
                    </em><br />

                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contribute to Universal equilibration, and locally this goes by way
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of entropy prduction. Nothing happens irreversibly without producing

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; efficiency, it is legitimate to say that whatever occurs does so IN

                    </em><br />
                    TO PRODUCE ENTROPY.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd like to thank Stan for a very nice overview of different terms
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;people use for the concept of the &quot;final cause&quot;. I will go on a
                        tangent
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;here, apologies to Bob and Igor.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's the chicken-and-egg problem of what was there earlier, entropy or
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the final cause. I tend to view things from the epistemological
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;standpoint, and I perceive Aristotelian causality as a construct.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Because we're habituated to think in terms of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;subject/object/how/why, we seek to answer these questions. Entropy is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;an approach to explaining the &quot;why&quot;-aspect of a phenomenon in a
                        formal

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;fashion.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;So while Stan sees entropy as an answer to &quot;why&quot;, I see entropy
                        as a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular model of &quot;why&quot;. Structural attractors are also models
                        of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;why&quot;, for example.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Yes, exactly so. Note that finalities can be ranked across realms
                    <br />
                    {physical finality {chemical finality {biological finality {sociopolitical
                    <br />
                    finality}}}}.
                    <br />
                <p>By the way, &quot;why&quot; is not as precise as the actual
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;definition of the final cause.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: OK. Could we have this definition (I can't seem to recall it)?
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In all, I'm quite confident in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aristotelian model, but I feel I can arbitrarily redefine what entropy is.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;All the four causes are equivalent. Trying to derive one of them
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(entropy) from another one (gravity), or vice versa (gravity from
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy) is a proven way of achieving splits between scientific and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical communities. Unless we transcend Aristotelian causality,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;let's not try to order the causes or eliminate them. It's been tried
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;too many times, to no avail.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I have argued only for using the negotiations between all four of
                    <br />
                    them to explain events (by the way I would be willing to send a small pdf
                    <br />
                    showing my views on the four causes to whoever would like to see it). I
                    <br />
                    have just been involved in a discussion where I have advanced finality
                    <br />
                    alongside formality, but it sees to have been taken that I was denying the
                    <br />
                    importance of formality.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, there are examples of imbalance among the causes. For example,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;if you have a lot of energy (growth), it will disperse into a lot of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy. If you have a lot of entropy, there is a lot of likelihood
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that some local gradient will get amplified and possibly self-organize.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's not that the model would &quot;force&quot; this to happen, it's just
                        that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;our reality is such that all causes are needed.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, Well put. I guess I am guilty of stressing finality in the Second
                    <br />
                    Law case because so many seem to wish to avoid seeing this aspect of things.
                    <br />
                <p>I add a short reply to Igor:
                    <br />
                    I see that Igor tries to find a way to shield himself from the 'heat' of
                    <br />
                    univeral equilibration. Very adroit! BUT it has the consequence that he
                    <br />
                    joins the postmodern social construction of knowledge movement that most
                    <br />
                    scientists abhor. In this view, these constructions merely serve human
                    <br />
                    economic interests, and the amusement of philosophy.

                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for Soren's concern about the meaning: we're in-system, our models
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;are intrinsically imperfect, but some models are more useful than no
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;models at all, as the statistician Box used to say. You cannot liberate

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;yourself from models, just as you cannot liberate your existence: give

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;up reason and instinct, and you'll be ruled by your reflexes and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;sensations, give up reflexes and sensations, and if you've survived
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;this far, you'll be consumed by those who haven't given up the reflexes
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;and sensations, and your philosophy will perish along with you.
