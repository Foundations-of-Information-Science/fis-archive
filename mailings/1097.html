<p>
Dear Shu-Kun and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Your idea (below) looks very good. We could try to gather some fis-related 
<br />
papers and also a few invitations to interesting authors (I think at least 
<br />
on Meggs and his 'biological homing'--other parties could suggest further 
<br />
names to invite). Let us keep pondering upon the idea for a while.
<br />
<p>In the physicalities involving molecular recognition, those related to 
<br />
symmetry (as already partially discussed) are perhaps the most attractive 
<br />
ones; but the 'glueing together' that accompanies the recognition process 
<br />
puts in front of us, again, the problem of 'bonds' (Xerman). My question, 
<br />
inspired by the 'coupled oscillator hypothesis' developed by JL Fox, in the 
<br />
70's, in order to explain the enzymic recognition and transformation of 
<br />
substrates, is the extent to which a common electromagnetic coupling 
<br />
(co-resonance?) could underly the three mol.recognition categories of 
<br />
similarity, complementarity and supplementarity (or heterogeneous 
<br />
complementarity) in most cases. Somehow, reminding bonds commonality 
<br />
itself, as some physical-chemists now are arguing. Further, there is a 
<br />
pretty challenging (and short) paper by Morowitz, 2001, where he argues 
<br />
that Pauli's Exclusion  Principle is the genuine responsible for the 
<br />
creation of all sorts of chemical information, including bonds --what I 
<br />
have summarized looks awfully sketchy, but his overall idea about 
<br />
physically explaining the evolutionary 'growth of information' and 
<br />
complexity in the most parsimonious way might be a challenge for us to 
<br />
develop a serious 'information physics' debate in a near future...
<br />
<p>Biologically, if we could make a big taxonomy --or just a big list-- of all 
<br />
kinds of mol. recognition phenomena occurring even in the simplest cells, 
<br />
we would find that the very list becomes crisscrossed by a myriad of 
<br />
'process' lines. Let us assume that those process lines can clearly be 
<br />
grouped into functional clusters (the holy grail of present day 
<br />
bioinformaticians arguing on 'systems biology'). Then, it is upon that 
<br />
strange functional skeleton of life that we have to situate the big 
<br />
questions about the informational characteristics of life. For instance, 
<br />
the meaningfulness of the generative/structural/comunicational forms of 
<br />
info (that captures and highlights, I think, the functional core of the 
<br />
system); or the very peculiar cognitive relationships of the system with 
<br />
respect to its own boundary conditions  --the latter being an aspect 
<br />
that  dramatically separates life's behavior from 'dynamics', indeed.
<br />
<p>Reductionism is mute about that strange and hiper-complex series of 
<br />
recognition couplings, because it only looks at the decomposition of 
<br />
processes into elements and subporcesses and not at their integration into 
<br />
behavioral or functional wholes.  Particularly looking at the relationship 
<br />
with the boundary conditions, enacted by a multitude of adaptive 
<br />
molecular-recognition events (ad hoc receptors, channels, transporters...), 
<br />
followed by further adaptive changes within the inner structures, life 
<br />
transcends dynamics and appears as 'informational' and not merely 
<br />
'autopoietic' or 'selforganized' (secondary aspects which may also be 
<br />
present in dynamic systems without the inner knowledge of life)... 
<br />
therefore the living system legitimately 'abduces' (as I argued long ago) 
<br />
and has 'purpose' (as James emphasized in old postings too). In other 
<br />
words, once life starts, we have a new kind of entity endowed not only with 
<br />
'dynamics' but also with 'infonics' (or 'infopoiesis') or whatever 
<br />
'informational dynamics' term we may choose. Properly characterizing that 
<br />
enlarged form of dynamics should be a crucial task.
<br />
<p>Are these speculations cogent in any extent? Sorry for having blurred 
<br />
together the bioinfo and the info physics discussion themes, but I think 
<br />
this is a very defining item for our entire enterprise ---one of the few 
<br />
places where we can do strategic advancements in a problem that 
<br />
reverberates at great length, and untractably, into a number of 
<br />
disciplinary fields.
<br />
<p>best post-vacational wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
