Dear Pavel, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I submit that one would gain explanatory power by considering the levels
<br />
that you distinguish not as levels, but as orthogonal dimensions. The
<br />
&quot;bridging sciences&quot; can then be analyzed in terms of covariations and
<br />
coevolutions (over time) that may develop into new dimension adding to
<br />
the systems complexity. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The multi-dimensional model of science can be operationalized, for
<br />
example, in terms of journal clusters.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Loet

<br />
<p><p>Dear Soeren and all,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I would like to elborate on some of the questions you have posed.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
You say &quot;The great thing about natural science is that physics,
<br />
chemistry and biology can be seen under one type of explanatory law
<br />
system. Why destroy that?&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From discussions on this list, in particular, one can come up with the
</em><br />
conclusion that branches of a natural science do not use the same
<br />
explanatory law system. They share the same ideological basis - the
<br />
materialistic worldview; they have also developed border-line
<br />
disciplines (biophysics, biochemistry...) that bridge these scientific
<br />
domains. Yet, the development of both chemistry and biology was
<br />
necessary because  physics alone was not (still is not, and maybe will
<br />
never be) capable to describe their phenomena. Both chemistry and
<br />
biology have developed their own language and concepts - indicating that
<br />
&quot;objects&quot; are different from those recognized by physics, and cannot be
<br />
reduced to a combination of concepts of the latter.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Similarly, neither biology nor physics alone are capable to describe
<br />
psychic and social phenomena, the &quot;traditional&quot; domains of meaning and
<br />
language. Can they share the same ideological basis, the materialistic
<br />
worldview? - of course. Can they develop &quot;bridging&quot; dicsiplines? - of
<br />
course, and there are already dozens of these disciplines,
<br />
neurophysiology and enviornmental economics to name a few. Can psychic
<br />
and social phenomena be reduced to the set of natural science concepts -
<br />
doubtfully.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This yields an answer to your other question, &quot;Is a theory of levels
<br />
really necessary?&quot;
<br />
Let me suggest it is inevitable. However, the identification of layers
<br />
can be different: yours is one structuring, Chandler's &quot;10 categories&quot;
<br />
recently mentioned in the list is another one. The identification
<br />
depends on researcher's perspective and purpose. But within each of
<br />
these categorizations, each level is introduced primarily because it
<br />
could not be described / explained completely by means at the previous
<br />
level. Reality itself may be interdependent, it is possible to say it
<br />
contains no layers. But our cognition is faced with its complexity,
<br />
either the limited computability (suggested as an explanation why neural
<br />
networks have been unable to imitate processes occuring in the brain) or
<br />
non-computability (suggested, I think, by Pattee as the key problem in
<br />
studies of life), and then a new &quot;layer of abtsraction&quot; is produced.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Consequently, you say that &quot;Information science is supposed to explain
<br />
life in a scientific way that avoids theories of meaning. Thus doesn't
<br />
biosemiotics destroy the whole 'plot' of information science?&quot;
<br />
Much in the same way, information science can be blamed for being
<br />
non-scientific, as principles of information science, and behavior of
<br />
infomation systems, cannot be derived from thermodynamics. Information
<br />
science does not directly fall into a sphere of natural sciences. Does
<br />
information science destroy a plot of thermodynamics?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It can be suggested, that at each &quot;layer of abstraction&quot; cogntion occurs
<br />
by accomplishing the following tasks: (1) identification of properties
<br />
and laws of the given layer; (2) integration of the previous layer as
<br />
&quot;an aspect&quot; of the given layer, (3) contribution to the construction of
<br />
a next layer.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Accordingly, information science may deal with following tasks:
<br />
1. identify properties of information and &quot;laws&quot; of natural information
<br />
systems
<br />
2. integrate thermodynamic aspect of information processes as a part of
<br />
information science
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If there cannot be an &quot;informational&quot; concept of meaning, then one has
<br />
to admit that semiotics builds up a new layer of cognition, to which
<br />
information science can only contribute, but which it is unable to
<br />
explain fully. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In my opinion, we are faced with following questions, based on what is
<br />
outlined:
<br />
1. is there a possibility for a concept that integrates meaning into
<br />
information perspective, or is meaning a concept of a &quot;new layer of
<br />
cognition&quot;?
<br />
2. similarly, is language a &quot;layer of cognition&quot; that cannot be
<br />
described and comprehended within the information / semiotics
<br />
perspective? (assuming that you speak of natural languages in the
<br />
society, and not &quot;language as a code&quot;)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If we accept a point of view that there are information processes that
<br />
can be attributed only to living systems, and those attributed only to
<br />
social systems, then these somehow are distinct. A universal information
<br />
theory that is suitable for both molecular reactions and social
<br />
interactions by no means is capable to capture perks of the latter - it
<br />
can only capture commonalities. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Kind regards
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Pavel Luksha
