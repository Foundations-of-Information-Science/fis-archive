<p>
Dear Jerry and Fis,
<br />
<p>thank you for entering a dialogue. This is the art insights may (or may not)
<br />
evolve, according to Plato and the other demi-gods of fundamental
<br />
consilience.
<br />
In your question, you distinguish between &quot;number&quot; and &quot;operation&quot;. E.g. in
<br />
&quot;3+3=6&quot; you distinguish between the &quot;3&quot; resp. &quot;6&quot; and &quot;+&quot; resp. &quot;=&quot;. Me not.
<br />
For me, &quot;3+3=6&quot; translates into &quot;a set of a total extent of 6 is now in 2
<br />
identical components; the probability for a set of this size to be in two
<br />
parts is p1=...; the probability for two parts to be of identical extent is
<br />
with a set of this size p2=...; m-class=0; trutch class=.2., ...&quot;
<br />
In fact, I propose to use a kind of (multi-dimensional) table the crude
<br />
model of which is as follows:
<br />
&nbsp;Let us pick for a demonstration the following properties of a {description
<br />
of a set|partition|addition}:
<br />
Property list:
<br />
(1) size,
<br />
(2)  no of fragments,
<br />
(3)  max no of identical fragm,
<br />
(4) number of different fragm,
<br />
(5) diff between max and min fragm,
<br />
(6) disj class,
<br />
(7) truth class,
<br />
(8) no of distinct sequences,
<br />
(9) overlap depth.
<br />
Now we tabulate the describing aspects and classify the observed according
<br />
to its probability (which we derive from dividing the frequencies of this
<br />
class by the marginal sums for this property). This should come like a
<br />
triangle  with identical rows' and columns' entry receiving a &quot;n.a.&quot; (like
<br />
in cities distance matrix or currency translation tables, where &#x20ac;, $, ¥, £
<br />
can be translated into each other). We throw together the usual, the left-
<br />
and the right-improbables. (~). (The distinction between left-improbable,
<br />
probable and right-improbable appears to explain quite many questions
<br />
connected to what the triplets are good for. To understand left, middle and
<br />
right probabilities, please look at Fig 3 of &quot;Possible Uses&quot;.
<br />
(<a href="../../hal.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ccsd-00002878">http://hal.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ccsd-00002878</a>))
<br />
An example with 64 = 4+4+3+5+4+1+7+3+4+3+5+4+2+5+3+2+5
<br />
Compared to all partitions of 64, this has 17 summands, slightly more than
<br />
the most probable of 13, so we assign a &quot;+&quot; for &quot;right-improbable class&quot; for
<br />
property &quot;(2) no of fragments&quot; as predicted by &quot;(1) size&quot;.
<br />
So we go thru all properties, always comparing this observation to the
<br />
statistics of all partitions. E.g. we can say &quot;(4) no of different
<br />
fragments&quot; is 6, about ~. (I cannot publish the relevant statistics here.
<br />
Maybe you will want to make a thoro statistics of additions on N so you can
<br />
compare any individual addition to that universe and establish its
<br />
/im-/probability.)
<br />
Then, and this is the revolutionary innovation, we re-extrapolate from
<br />
property i unto property j (like we did from (1) unto (2) and (4) in the
<br />
paragraph above.
<br />
This reads like:
<br />
Compared to all partitions with 17 summands, this one points on the property
<br />
&quot;(1) size&quot; to 64. This is slightly lower than the most probable value of
<br />
about 71, so we assign a &quot;-&quot; for &quot;left-improbable class&quot; for property &quot;(1)
<br />
size&quot; as predicted by &quot;(2) no of fragments&quot;.
<br />
We redo this and redo again and find that size is one of the least stable
<br />
properties of a set. The pointers to the most probable associated property
<br />
appear to make a screwdriver. This is an inherently instable (or
<br />
quasi-stable) system of references where some constellations reappear in a
<br />
different size environment. It is the same just bigger. In a probability
<br />
numbering space some additions appear to be (and now, I am stuck for words,
<br />
because this observation has no name) {&quot;linear translations&quot;,
<br />
&quot;similarities&quot;, &quot;form identities&quot;, &quot;relatives&quot;, &quot;&lt;you give it a name&gt;&quot;} like
<br />
the betting chances of picking any one from 8 out of 26 as compared to
<br />
picking any one from 16 out of 52.
<br />
&nbsp;Do you get the picture? In my model of a counting system, we do not deal
<br />
too much with &quot;size&quot; but watch whether RELATIVE to size there is a) about
<br />
adequate (expected) no of fragments, or left-improb (too few fragments) or
<br />
right-improb (too finely ground, too many fragments), b) about adequate
<br />
(expected) no of identical fragments, or left-improb (too few identical
<br />
fragments) or right-improb (too uniformly ground, too many identical
<br />
fragments), c) about adequate (expected) no of distinct fragments, or
<br />
left-improb (too few distinct fragments) or right-improb (too differently
<br />
ground, too many distinct fragments), ... etc., and then
<br />
RELATIVE to no of rragments there is a) about adequate (expected) size, or
<br />
left-improb (too small) or right-improb (too big), b) about adequate
<br />
(expected) no of identical fragments, or left-improb (too few identical
<br />
fragments) or right-improb (too uniformly ground, too many identical
<br />
fragments), c) about adequate (expected) no of distinct fragments, or
<br />
left-improb (too few distinct fragments) or right-improb (too differently
<br />
ground, too many distinct fragments), ... etc., and so on.
<br />
It may help to know that there is maximally ln(E(n)) distinct aspects
<br />
(properties) to a set of size n (E(n) being the number of partitions of n).
<br />
After having categorised the set according to lnE(n) dimensions, one will
<br />
certainly run into redundancies. (The probability that an additional
<br />
classification will repeat one that has already been made reaches 1.0; the
<br />
extent of nonredundant information transported by a classification after
<br />
lnEn classification falls to 0.0)
<br />
It may also be useful to know that the collection is NOT infinite, so it is
<br />
useful to build up the statistics of all partitions of each natural number
<br />
(below ca. 140). (Please, relase me from explaining why 140. &quot;Possible Uses&quot;
<br />
gives a short discussion on that.) The probability that a sentence detailing
<br />
congruent relations on a set n &gt; 139 is redundant is 1.0.
<br />
Of course, to do the grunt work, one should have the cooperation of and an
<br />
interest by a competent center for high-power computing. Maybe, you know
<br />
anyone who is interested in basic science. If so, please, do drop me a line.
<br />
So, Jerry et al, in this model you do not distinguish &quot;operator&quot; and
<br />
&quot;argument&quot; when describing a collection in its present (and most probable
<br />
next and next and next and next ...) fragmentational state.
<br />
Sorry for the inappropriate polish of this contribution. As I understand,
<br />
FIS does not support tables and graphics. Is there a way to upload files or
<br />
tables or statistics?
<br />
Looking forward your next question:
<br />
Karl
<br />
PS.: as to entries into the periodic table of elements, these appear to be
<br />
logical archetypes. Please look up the chi-square distribution and make the
<br />
frequencies tables of partitions, according to their formal properties (like
<br />
outlined above, that should be sufficient for a starter) before I can
<br />
explain this to you. But please do, because the concept is worth unfolding
<br />
and explaining and understanding. It allows for superb combinatorics
<br />
(building molecules, etc.) and I believe this is what you are after with
<br />
your theoretical chemistry. Yell after you got the tables.
