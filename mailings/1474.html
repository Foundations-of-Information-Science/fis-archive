<p>
Various contributors have emphasized the probabilistic nature of
<br />
reality and the beauty of probability theory. I concurr with both
<br />
sentiments. I thought before we moved off completely to new topics,
<br />
however, I would like to add a few of my own opinions about the
<br />
necessity of aleatoric events that transcend probability theory. The
<br />
usual assumptions that enable one to address and quantify chance are
<br />
that unpredictable events are both simple and repeatable.
<br />
Repeatability is especially important, for if anything were to occur
<br />
that is truly unique, it simply could not be treated by conventional
<br />
statistical techniques. I would like to suggest, however, that with
<br />
complex systems we must face the possibility that *many* events
<br />
occurring are singular and unique for all time.
<br />
<p>To see why unique events are not only likely but inevitable, I invoke
<br />
an argument formulated several decades ago by Walter Elsasser. Elsasser
<br />
sought to delimit what he called an &quot;enormous&quot; number. By this he was
<br />
referring to numbers of possibilities so large that they must be
<br />
excluded from physical consideration, because they greatly exceed the
<br />
number of physical events that possibly could have occurred since the
<br />
Big Bang. To provide an estimate of the threshold for enormous numbers
<br />
Elsasser reckoned the number of simple protons in the known universe to
<br />
be about 10^85. He then noted as how the number of nanoseconds that
<br />
have transpired since the beginning of the universe is about 10^25.
<br />
Hence, his rough estimate of the upper limit on the number of
<br />
conceivable events that could have occurred in the physical world is
<br />
about 10^110.  Any number of possibilities much larger than this value
<br />
simply loses any meaning with respect to physical reality.
<br />
<p>Anyone familiar with combinatorics immediately will realize that it
<br />
doesn't take very many identifiable elements or processes before the
<br />
number of possible configurations among them becomes enormous. One
<br />
doesn't need Avagadro's Number of particles (10^23) to produce
<br />
combinations in excess of 10^110 -- a system with merely 80 or so
<br />
distinguishable components will suffice. In probabilistic terms, any
<br />
event randomly comprised of more than 80 separate elements is almost
<br />
certain never to have occurred earlier in the history of the universe.
<br />
Such a constellation is unique once and for all time. It follows, then,
<br />
that in the ecosystems I deal with, involving hundreds or thousands of
<br />
distinguishable organisms, one must reckon not just with the occasional
<br />
unique event, but with legions of them. Unique, singular events are
<br />
occurring all the time, everywhere!
<br />
<p>One is suddenly confronted by the sheer ubiquity of the aleatoric. The
<br />
fabric of causality manifests holes everywhere, at all levels. In the
<br />
full panoply of events, arbitrarily close to any phenomenon that
<br />
conforms to a law, one can find gaps that, by virtue of their
<br />
uniqueness, never can be covered by any conceivable law. One is
<br />
reminded of the Born-Caratheodory formulation of the second law of
<br />
thermodynamics, which says that arbitrarily close to any state of a
<br />
system lies another state that cannot be reached by a reversible
<br />
process. Similarly, one could argue that arbitrarily close to any event
<br />
that is lawful in either the deterministic sense, one can find singular
<br />
events. Hence, reality is not a compact continuum, but resembles rather
<br />
a &quot;complex manifold&quot; in the fractal sense
<br />
<p>The best to all,
<br />
Bob Ulanowicz
