<p>
FIS friends,
<br />
<p>Thanks particularly to Ana, Giuseppina, and Michel. It is refreshing 
<br />
hearing the voices from people working on the experimental side of 
<br />
molecular sciences. Confronting the theoretical problems of chemistry, 
<br />
biochemistry, molecular biology, etc., we should not forget that these 
<br />
bodies of knowledge have been gained mostly from the experimental bench, 
<br />
with all its serendipity and happenstances. Until recently, the role of 
<br />
molecular-chemical theory has been very modest, and even today it is quite 
<br />
frequent hearing from physical chemists about unfaithful claims built 
<br />
around awkward quantum simplifications.
<br />
<p>Arguing or exploring about an overarching &quot;logic of chemistry&quot; (and around 
<br />
&quot;non arithmetic&quot; atomic numbers) as Jerry suggests, may be fertile, but one 
<br />
may easily forget that chemistry has to tackle a &quot;plurality of simultaneous 
<br />
occurrences&quot;, in general involving very complex physical interactions 
<br />
about, for instance, charge, spin, lattice, orbitals... where, in each one, 
<br />
by large nonlinearities dominate; and where the &quot;composite&quot; object --eg, a 
<br />
complex biomolecule-- becomes miles away from being &quot;reduced&quot; bona fide in 
<br />
its chemical global properties down to a reasonable system of 
<br />
physical-mathematical laws.
<br />
<p>In what extent the highly composite nature of the chemical object 
<br />
(manipulable only as such, experimentally) becomes a barrier to a massive 
<br />
interconnection of its whole explanatory &quot;formal procedures&quot;?  I am not 
<br />
sure that this argument strait-ahead justifies the present computational 
<br />
challenges mentioned by Ana and colleagues, and that new more powerful 
<br />
abstractions and logic&amp; symbolic systems would not overcome some of them; 
<br />
but I would bet in favor of the non computable problems always haunting 
<br />
those in charge of chemical models (think on the problems just with water, 
<br />
mentioned by Michel).
<br />
<p>Maybe the points on natural computer science raised by Kevin and Gordana 
<br />
are related. We may easily take for granted that a coverage under the 
<br />
umbrella of &quot;mathematical machines&quot; working on sophisticate topological 
<br />
properties of electronic circuits, by the use of Boolean networks operating 
<br />
on solid-state devices (and functionally independent), is the natural 
<br />
theoretical model for any &quot;informational or computational occurrence.&quot; Even 
<br />
the world itself, not only as a theoretical object, may appear as a 
<br />
gigantic computer, a la Wheeler (nope... or maybe, yes, but along a 
<br />
dramatic reinterpretation of the whole three mechanics --classical, 
<br />
statistical, quantum? Excuse me the wild derivation)
<br />
<p>Anyhow, a stringent border seems necessary between let us call it 
<br />
&quot;information processing&quot;, either performed by electric currents or by means 
<br />
of biomolecular networks. Between topologies of circulating electrical 
<br />
currents, and myriads of molecular recognition events. Between massive 
<br />
&quot;free&quot; Boolean constructs, and massive &quot;adaptive&quot; self-constructing 
<br />
life-cycles... (months ago, this very theme had already surfaced, somehow 
<br />
as embodiments of language, its &quot;worldliness&quot;)... If I could bring order 
<br />
into these studies, the starting point, or say one of the basic pillars of 
<br />
the &quot;information bridge&quot; upon the biomolecular turbulent waters, in my 
<br />
opinion, should be built around the characterization of molecular 
<br />
recognition events, downwards and upwards.
<br />
<p>Thanking the patience!
<br />
<p>Pedro
