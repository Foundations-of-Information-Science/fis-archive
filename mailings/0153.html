<p>
Rafael--
<br />
<p>I agree these are very &quot;tricky formulations for designing very different
<br />
things.&quot;  It was ian attempt, admiteddly bound to fail, to capture these
<br />
differences that I used all three terms.  I had spent some time asking
<br />
Anglo-American philosophers if there were a difference between &quot;ethics&quot; and
<br />
&quot;morals&quot; and was told Morals relates to sex and Ethics relates to the rest.
<br />
That disappointed me so totally I decided to make up my own meanings.  The
<br />
result is not exactly what you said.
<br />
<p>However, Aristotle's use of the root word &quot;ethos&quot; suggests that customs and
<br />
mores was at work in his formulation.  Also, I wanted to get at some of
<br />
what Durkheim said about religion.  Finally, there is a nice academic
<br />
cottage industry in America (see MacIntyre, e.g.) which describes ethics as
<br />
the form of knowledge for determing what is moral.  The older tradition
<br />
which ranks Morals as primary and Ethics as legalistic and secondary was
<br />
less appealing to me.
<br />
<p>Anyway, I would make the following distinctions:
<br />
&quot;morals&quot; = the symbolic representation of end-states;
<br />
&quot;ethics&quot; = the rules for achieving these end-states; and
<br />
&quot;values&quot; = the relative positive or negative weightings attached to
<br />
end-states.  (The latter comes close to the Homeric notion of dividing
<br />
spoils properly, which was also in Aristotle's mind.)
<br />
<p>Morals sanction organizational structures; ethics teach people how to act
<br />
so those sanctioned structures can be reached; and values are the emotional
<br />
triggers motivating action.  So, if people &quot;know&quot; where they ought to be,
<br />
have a sense of how to get there, and are excited about the prospects, then
<br />
my supposition is they will be inclined to pick certain behavioral options
<br />
rather than others and a social system will endure.
<br />
<p>What I was, in any case, trying to get at is the totality of elements that
<br />
must be involved to influence human choices and actions in ways that could
<br />
account for the otherwise miraculous fact that societies endure over time.
<br />
I thought there was more to it than any one of those terms in isolation
<br />
would imply, so I put them all together.
<br />
<p>Of course, any thing like a social system will replicate because of what
<br />
the information stored in it MEANS, which is why I also tried to link the
<br />
problem of social information to an environmental context.  Thus, some
<br />
moral statement like &quot;Thou shalt not ...&quot; generally speaking does not
<br />
actually prohibit the behavior it specifies, for there are rules for
<br />
defining the .... which apply in various ways in multiple situations with
<br />
diverse results.  This makes for problems, of course, but it also is what
<br />
makes social systems, unlike crystals, dynamic, evolving, self-trasnforming
<br />
systems.
<br />
<p>I am wondering if something like a value-free definition of value, which is
<br />
part of what I am after, implies our societies have relaxed their
<br />
constraints to the point where evolution is virtually continuoius, because
<br />
individuals are always able to fluctuate social structures by choosing
<br />
something unexpected or new.  Are we at &quot;the edge of chaos&quot; and, if so, can
<br />
we handle the stress?
<br />
<p>Once again, Rafael, your contributions to these discussions prove really
<br />
valuable.  Thanks for taking the time.
<br />
<p>Bob Artigiani
