Dear Pedro, Stan, and All,
<br />
<p>I have some questions in reference to Pedro's and Stan's nice line of 
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<p>Pedro wrote:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather than continuing the discussion about Stan's integrative categories, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would advocate for the search of a genuine 'informational' approach to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sciences. I mean, logics, natural language, number theory, etc., are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important tools of most scientific disciplines, but they tell very little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on how the disciplines should interrelate. Or about the 'relevance' of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different approaches to the problems to confront. Per se, they are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools of inter-disciplinary consilience (they are 'intra').
</em><br />
<p>So, you don't think that the use of common tools, such as logic, statistics, 
<br />
etc., or even common concepts (such as Aleks's example of intereactive 
<br />
information) are enough to forge a genuine inter-disciplinary consilience? 
<br />
In what way would a *genuine* informational approach be different?
<br />
<p>Pedro wrote:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A related problem is that most of the abstractions needed for the sciences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; militate against an adequate 'external' vision of the sciences themselves. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we abstract, idealize, rationalize, categorize, measure, etc., quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often we go beyond any imperfections and limitations (&quot;God's view&quot; --for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gell-Mann it is the &quot;principle of rational description of the universe&quot;). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this point of view is applied to the sciences, we leave in the outside 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very social and temporal structure of the scientific communities: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means of communication, consensus formation, fixation of standards, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criss-cross of references, emergence of 'fields', paradigms, etc., dialog 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between different scientific communities, interdisciplinary consilience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<p>There is a distinction made in philosophy of science between the internal 
<br />
dynamics of science, which excludes socio-psychological factors, and 
<br />
external dynamics, which looks only at the social dynamics of scientific 
<br />
communities.  This seems to be similar to the distinction that Pedro is 
<br />
making.  If so, his claim is that interdisciplinary consilience cannot be 
<br />
captured within the internalist's way of viewing science (that is, in terms 
<br />
of the bare relationship between theories and their evidence).  I have some 
<br />
questions about this.
<br />
<p>I think that anyone who studies science has to make some kind of 
<br />
idealization or abstraction--science is too complex to understand in total. 
<br />
Some simplifications have to be made when studying any complex phenomenon. 
<br />
Clearly that does not imply that the particular idealizations made by the 
<br />
internalists or the externalists are the right ones, or the best ones, to 
<br />
make for the purpose of understanding some particular aspect of science, 
<br />
such as interdisciplinary consilience.  So, I am very open to Pedro's line 
<br />
of thought.  On the other hand, there has to some kind of simplification 
<br />
made.  How should this be done?

<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me speculate that future 'informational' explorations of similar

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems that have barely been addressed yet (how living cells emerge out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from very limited 'molecular societies of enzymes', how nervous systems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and consciousness emerge out from terribly limited 'societies of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual neurons'...) may throw a new light on the globality of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific enterprise. At least, we should seriously consider the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'limitations' of the individual / observer when approaching the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interdisciplinary consilience problem. After all, wasn't a good part of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new physics stemming out from theorizing upon limitations of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific observer in his/her idealized actions/perceptions in different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; settings--uncertainty, second law, relativity?
</em><br />
<p>This is a partial answer to my question: A general understanding of how 
<br />
macroscopic order arises out of simple interactive micro-systems may point 
<br />
the way towards a better understanding of science.
<br />
<p>An example that I know more about arises in physics, where it is difficult 
<br />
to explain why matter organizes itself into liquid, gas and solid phases 
<br />
when interacting molecules &quot;know&quot; nothing about the macroscopic order of 
<br />
which they are a part.  This phenomenon is hard to explain because critical 
<br />
phenomena (occurring during phase transitions) depend on correlations that 
<br />
act at all distances at the same time.  That is, the usual idealization that 
<br />
density fluctuations are limited to micro-scales does not work.  Rather, the 
<br />
fluctuations occur at all length scales (hence the self-similarity of 
<br />
critical phenomena).  The mathematical techniques applied to this problem 
<br />
(scaling, intermediate asymptotics, and renormalization methods borrowed 
<br />
from quantum field theory) are still not very well understood from a 
<br />
mathematical point of view.
<br />
<p>However, I still don't see exactly how this connects with interdisciplinary 
<br />
consilience in Pedro's sense.  This may be because I'm not sure exactly what 
<br />
interdisciplinary consilience amounts to on this view.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At least, we should seriously consider the 'limitations' of the individual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; / observer when approaching the interdisciplinary consilience problem.
</em><br />
<p>But why should it be considered seriously, exactly?  I don't (yet) see why 
<br />
the internalist view of science has this limitation.  For it abstracts away 
<br />
of the distinction between individual scientists and a group of scientists, 
<br />
so it could easily include emergent features that arise from the 
<br />
interactions between individuals.  If not, why not?
