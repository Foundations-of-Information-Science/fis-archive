<br />
<p>Dear Pedro and list,
<br />
<p>Once again Pedro, I am in general agreement with your observations.
<br />
<p>However, what you ask here is not merely for a simple definition of 
<br />
information but the entire context in which such a notion can be 
<br />
founded.  Other definitions / notions are needed.  You must define what it 
<br />
is to &quot;know&quot; - what meaning and prediction are, for example.
<br />
<p>I have explored this question somewhat - so let me put it out there as a 
<br />
&quot;straw man.&quot;  This model takes my previous assertions regarding experience 
<br />
as its premise.
<br />
<p>In my model all metaphysics is the embodied content of experience.
<br />
<p>Meaning is the embodied trace of experience - the physiological structure 
<br />
that characterizes a product of semeiosis.  Here is the cellular level 
<br />
requirement - as yet determined, but let us point to neuroplasticity as a 
<br />
possible example. Penrose might point to Orchestrated Objective Reduction 
<br />
as another possible example - whatever, it doesn't matter at this point 
<br />
except to observe that the model's architecture, when detailed, allows the 
<br />
prediction of the engineering of that physiological structure.
<br />
<p>Knowledge is the determinant of action.  That is, it is revealed in action, 
<br />
in sentient entities it is the product of semeiosis over the embodied 
<br />
meaning set.  We know how to walk by our innate embodiment of meaning - the 
<br />
product of our genetics.  We know how to prove the Pythagoras theorem by 
<br />
acquired embodied meaning.  We know how to communicate by speech because we 
<br />
share a common acquired embodied convention (imperfectly).
<br />
<p>Books, paintings, music are all marks - the subjects of signs.  Signs are 
<br />
the embodied experience of marks.  The sun rise, the wind blowing, flower 
<br />
in the field, are all marks.  Marks are either natural marks - the product 
<br />
of physical laws - or they are metaphysical marks - the product of 
<br />
intent.  Intent is the meaning embodied by the creator of a metaphysical 
<br />
mark in its creation.
<br />
<p>Semeiosis is the ongoing experience of signs - both those embodied as the 
<br />
traces of experience from past semeiosis and those that are the immediate 
<br />
product of senses.
<br />
<p>So, finally, what is information?  Information is that which informs - by 
<br />
which we mean it identifies cause and adds to knowledge (see above 
<br />
definition).
<br />
<p>In my model I generalize the notion of knowledge so that I can apply the 
<br />
notion over inanimate/non-sentient cases - I know that this generalization 
<br />
makes people uncomfortable, as it does me on occasion,  but it is by this 
<br />
generalization that I can essentially define information simply as 
<br />
&quot;difference&quot; in all cases and I can argue that a particle &quot;knows&quot; what 
<br />
action to take as the product of information input.  This leads inevitably 
<br />
to my notion of &quot;perfect action&quot; ... but that will side track us here.
<br />
<p>For completeness I should also mention my prediction model.  Abduction is 
<br />
the foundation of all prediction - it is the unfettered 
<br />
intuition.  Induction is the constraint of abduction by prior reductive 
<br />
experience - we learn induction by taking apart the world and putting it 
<br />
back together.  Deduction is the constraint of induction by formal 
<br />
conventions (such as mathematical logic) that we use in analysis and 
<br />
communication.
<br />
<p>I hope this helps the discussion - I think I covered all Pedro's points.
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven
<br />
<p><pre>
