Dear Bob
<br />
dear colleagues
<br />
<p>Fortunately the problems with your address are over, you do not need to do
<br />
anynothing else. Your last message has directly entered into the net
<br />
(unlike the previous ones, which were rejected and I had to re-enter them
<br />
one by one--this was one of the serious reasons for the pause!). About
<br />
these other troubles you mention perhaps there are problems with your own
<br />
server (or maybe there is a virus at work).
<br />
<p>My personal opinion on your position paper is that you have put our
<br />
discussion terribly on track: right into the middle of the socioinfo
<br />
matters. We could go ahead in quite a few directions (G. is pointing at
<br />
several of them). But previously I would love to hear your reply to Morris
<br />
last message (if you lost it, I am including it herewith). His poignant
<br />
argument on the origins of socioinfo reminds me the bioinfo problem too:
<br />
how can we conclude that a &quot;bioinfo&quot; new realm has taken off from a
<br />
chemical milieu? My own reply was the peptide bond within a water-matrix,
<br />
then capable of overcoming the &quot;memory&quot; limitations by means of nucleic
<br />
acids. Now Morris argues that it is the coupling between INVENTION and VEMS
<br />
overcoming the &quot;memory limitations&quot; of an oral culture what becomes the
<br />
prime socioinfo factor...
<br />
<p>It is an intriguing observation, that parallels (as he says) some of Ted's
<br />
reflections--but in general, what sort of criteria allow us to say that
<br />
here is at work a new info realm that deserves a neat subdisciplinary
<br />
treatment? just pragmatics?
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. For the sake of future discussions, eg, Brier and Bela are planning a
<br />
new one, it would be good if we accepted the capacity of moderators to cool
<br />
down or to heat up discussions (either by a short pause or by entitling
<br />
them to ask opinions to anyone in the net).

<br />
<p>Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Having recently read Diamond's book (guns, germs and steel), I cannot help
<br />
but having some disagreements with Bob's and Gottfried's views. Well, Bob´s
<br />
texts are really valuable because they go to the heart of the socioinfo
<br />
problem (in my opinion), but perhaps the explanatory road he advances
<br />
should start a little bit earlier -- I mean he considers socioinformation
<br />
in connection with &quot;roles&quot; (and then VEMS) of rather complex, specialized
<br />
societies, and there is almost no consideration of the previous social
<br />
stages: bands and tribes. His argument about the origins of agriculture is
<br />
a two-edged sword: there have been plenty of cases in which food production
<br />
has not involved specialization; and viceversa, whole tribes living close
<br />
to exceptionally rich ecosystems advanced significantly in the development
<br />
of roles, etc. (eg, salmon fisheries in the Canadian West coast).
<br />
Agriculture and husbandry were really BIG INVENTIONS forced by the BIG
<br />
EXTINCTIONS of that very period... It is not just that social &quot;constraints&quot;
<br />
are the prime socioinfo factor, but perhaps the &quot;discoveries&quot; of natural
<br />
world info...     And my own thesis is that when these discoveries go
<br />
beyond the memory limitations of oral cultures, then societies (some of
<br />
them) cross the socioinfo threshold into VEMS (and hierarchies, and
<br />
burocracies...)
<br />
<p>After the healthy pause (I believe it was OK for us to digest all the good
<br />
stuff produced these days) I have arrived to a similar point I made on the
<br />
debate about consciousness: the need to relate it to animal consciousness.
<br />
The same may be the case here.
<br />
<p>cheers
<br />
<p>Morris
<br />
<p>PS. Ted, your point on (info motivated) organizational principles is very
<br />
suggestive. I believe it applies to my above thesis.
