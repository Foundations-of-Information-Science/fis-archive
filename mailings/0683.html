<p>
I have a problem with the petition presented to us by elohimjl.
<br />
Whether or not this list is the right place for a petition is not 'my
<br />
call'. My concern is with the assumptions in the text.
<br />
<p>Some of these assumptions are:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) that the corporate person is not also a human person; and that
<br />
a corporation is by definition, corrupt;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) that the individual, defined as a citizen, is somehow
<br />
inherently good, just, non-destroying, non-polluting while the
<br />
corporate individual is the 'polluter and exploiter'.
<br />
<p>I'm afraid that I don't see the validity of this polarity. From what
<br />
I've seen, individuals, ordinary citizens, are heavily involved in
<br />
'pollution' and 'exploitation'. They are quite capable of violations
<br />
of laws, of theft, of indifference to the well-being of their
<br />
neighbours, of a focus on short-term economic gain, etc, etc.
<br />
<p>I'm not aware that 'we the peoples ' have &quot;always spoken out and acted
<br />
when there is injustice&quot;. It is the ordinary citizen that is more
<br />
likely to become a member of an opinionated popular ideology and to
<br />
take part in hate crimes: - whether in Ireland, the Middle East,
<br />
Bosnia, Rwanda, etc, etc.
<br />
<p>Local cultures and knowledge practices are not always, in themselves,
<br />
the right type of knowledge for a changing economy. The peasant
<br />
farmer, and local knowledge are able to sustain only his own extended
<br />
family, and neither can cope with the need for a new technology that
<br />
will feed the increased population of his society.
<br />
Genuine harmony with nature? What does this mean? There are basic
<br />
'forces of interaction' in our cosmos; these are interactional, but
<br />
these interactions are not always homogenous and without conflict.
<br />
Indeed, conflict, with its concomitant dissipation of one entity to
<br />
another, is a basic reality of nature...within the atomic as well as
<br />
the biological realms.
<br />
Quality outcomes to local communities are a result, not merely of work
<br />
by individuals, but also of work by collectives, ie, corporations and
<br />
governments.
<br />
Democracy is a basic requirement for a 'just growth', but small local
<br />
communities and individuals are not, by genetic construction,
<br />
inherently democratic. A small community can well be a reactionary
<br />
close-minded cult.
<br />
<p>Democracy works best with individuals who are 'skeptical', critical,
<br />
knowledgeable and whose economy gives them the freedom to move. These
<br />
behavioural qualities are found within both corporate and
<br />
non-corporate individuals. And, in particular, someone in business and
<br />
the economy, had better be critical and skeptical, and grounded in
<br />
real hard facts - or- another individual (corporate or not) will
<br />
remove them.
<br />
<p>3)Another assumption is that corporations and development paradigms
<br />
destroy peoples and nature. I think that it's individuals who do both.
<br />
If you do away with a corporation, you will not do away with someone
<br />
polluting a river or setting fire to the forest.
<br />
<p>4) Rejecting technologies and products that endanger nature, health
<br />
and life etc? Just about anything we develop, anything at all, will
<br />
and must have an effect on nature. That is the reality of our
<br />
networked cosmos. One thing affects another thing. Bring sheep to the
<br />
European grasslands in the 14th century, and you will change the
<br />
ecology and economy.
<br />
<p>5) Patenting of nature?  I'm afraid I have no idea what this means.
<br />
<p>6) Reclaim nature and the rights of indigenous peoples and local
<br />
communities.  This suggests that Nature is a static whole, but nature,
<br />
as a dynamic biomass, is evolving and changing. Therefore - what is
<br />
being reclaimed?  Indigenous peoples?  These peoples (and I'm an
<br />
anthropologist) were living in small communities. Their economic
<br />
infrastructures are capable of supporting only small populations. How,
<br />
given the enormous increase in world population since the 14th
<br />
century - how are you proposing to deal with the support of this
<br />
population?  Most certainly, small scale indigenous economies and
<br />
small scale political systems cannot support or organize, large
<br />
communities. It simply doesn't work.
<br />
<p>7) To reclaim our national gov'ts and the UN from corporate take-over.
<br />
&nbsp;My response to this - is that the era of the nation-state, able to
<br />
support its own population within its own territory, is over. The
<br />
population of the world is simply too large for single self-supporting
<br />
nations.
<br />
And - I question the inherent definitions of corporations as corrupt.
<br />
Many national governments were and are corrupt.
<br />
<p>What I think needs to be done, is that a global economy and political
<br />
infrastructure has to be developed. This is obviously being developed,
<br />
first, by private corporations. This can't last, and the next stage
<br />
would be a world gov't. At the moment, the US is fighting that. But -
<br />
it will come.
