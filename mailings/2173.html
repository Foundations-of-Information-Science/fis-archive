<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>The remarkable plurality of definitions of information we have seen these 
<br />
days--in a formal way, almost of all of them-- together with their highly 
<br />
problematic congruence, motivate me to continue some reflections on the 
<br />
non-formal aspects of information...
<br />
<p>The engagement of any &quot;thinker&quot; or &quot;observer&quot; into anyone of our scientific 
<br />
disciplines, implies that he or she will get engaged into a social 
<br />
&quot;cognitive network&quot; that puts very interesting constraints and 
<br />
idealizations regarding what classes of information should be entered and 
<br />
how should they be processed by the individual's cognitive capabilities of 
<br />
the thinker (would we claim in our daily lifes the privileged status of the 
<br />
scientific observer: universality, objectivity, God's view point, etc.?) I 
<br />
have already argued that by following these disciplinary guidelines the 
<br />
most interesting &quot;ecumenical&quot; aspects of information, particularly those 
<br />
related to &quot;meaning&quot;, disappear.
<br />
<p>However, when we look at the observer or thinker in the spare time, just 
<br />
when he/she is not acting in that peculiar &quot;scientific&quot; way, we only see 
<br />
the ordinary citizen involved in the typical magmatic occurrences of daily 
<br />
life, needless to name them, and which are automatically discarded by any 
<br />
serious discipline (or again, dramatically cut so as to fit into a concrete 
<br />
disciplinary mold)... The nontrivial point I would like to make around such 
<br />
trivialities, is that by exploring into that &quot;light&quot; territory of our daily 
<br />
lives we can have the opportunity to converge on the enlarged sense of 
<br />
&quot;what is information&quot; ---I am tempted to say that irrespective of cultural 
<br />
differences, epochs, countries, etc.
<br />
<p>Imagine a neuron taking part of a distributed &quot;neural network&quot; in a living 
<br />
brain. That neuron could boast that its spike production--its management of 
<br />
electrical currents-- constitutes a sophisticate formal construction that 
<br />
is elegantly integrated in the collective information processing of the 
<br />
brain. Those electrical discharges define what is information processing. 
<br />
Yes, and no... as immediately a chorus of glial cells (microglia, 
<br />
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and other smaller classes) far outnumbering 
<br />
neurons at least by one or two orders of magnitude, would argue about the 
<br />
many ways in which they contribute to the overall organization of the 
<br />
brain, of neurons themselves, and the overall information processing too. 
<br />
If rather than looking only to spikes we had looked at the whole 
<br />
biomolecular life-cycle of the neuron, those global &quot;informational&quot; 
<br />
contributions would have spoken by themselves.
<br />
<p>In short, cell-cycles are the necessary reference for making sense on the 
<br />
cellular construction of meaning. And human life-cycles would be the 
<br />
necessary reference for a generalized approach to information, 
<br />
&quot;meaningfully&quot; treated.
<br />
<p>Helas, but how to do it? Could it be crystallized into a new &quot;formality&quot; 
<br />
having the best of both worlds then?
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
