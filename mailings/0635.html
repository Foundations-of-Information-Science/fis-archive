Thanks Juan,
<br />
<p>Yes I'll try out your food experiment on my retriever this weekend.
<br />
<p>My guess is you're right - she's a tad smarter than Maturana's frog
<br />
or your average amoeba.
<br />
<p>&lt;I really would like to see an organized discussion of the concept of purpose
<br />
&lt;or intentionality (I suppose they are the same).
<br />
<p>I think we agree if there is no purposive interaction there is probably not an
<br />
informational situation. But let's not wander down the semantic track 
<br />
for the momement. I am happy to suspend the word 'purpose' and bracket 
<br />
'consciousness' for the life of this conference. Quotidian informational 
<br />
behaviour is notoriously serendipitous and unconscious.
<br />
<p>But how far back down the evolutionary process do we have to go before we stop
<br />
speaking of decisions and talk about automatic mapping? 
<br />
<p>&lt;I think that only a neural information system can make decisions. Do you
<br />
&lt;agree?
<br />
<p>I agree with the 'neural system' bit but if we are defining information in
<br />
terms of decision-making we need to leave 'information' out of the equation -
<br />
is it necessarily a 'system'? That is what we are trying to discover.
<br />
<p>The most interesting point in your paper for me was:
<br />
<p>'Given a complex system, structural order alone does not represent 
<br />
information-information appears only when structural order leads 
<br />
to specific change elsewhere.'
<br />
<p>That is what agency in an 'informational experience' is all about.
<br />
<p>John Collier made the nice analogy :
<br />
<p>'the information  about spots in the butterfly genes is there, but 
<br />
not much use to the butterfly -- it has to get this information to 
<br />
the wings for it to be useful'
<br />
<p>i.e. the experience of 'having spots' only becomes informational 
<br />
for the butterfly when the genetic 'spots' (structural order) lead 
<br />
to a specific change in the wings. The physical spots ('info-mation')
<br />
become 'in-for-mation' - data in context for an observing system 
<br />
(say, for a predatory creature)in an environmental interaction.
<br />
<p>In the same way this email (structure) does not become a message
<br />
for somebody unless there is an interactive change in the recipient's 
<br />
mind etc beyond the 'limbic' reaction of hitting the delete key.
<br />
<p>I think informational agency possibly operates across the spectrum of 
<br />
interactions from protein binding to courtship behaviour and database 
<br />
searching - but that needs cross-disciplinary research to justify.
<br />
<p>We should continue to compare notes.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
<p>John H
<br />

<br />
<p><p>Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>This is in reply to some comments by James Barham, John Holgate (both 19
<br />
June) and Pedro Marijuán (June 5). 
<br />
<p>James wrote:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think you go a little too far when you say (in paragraph 3) that &quot;there
</em><br />
is no energy coupling between sender and receiver&quot; in a true information-use
<br />
scenario. Rather, I would say, the informational signal must be very low in
<br />
energy in relation to the energies involved in the stability of the sender
<br />
and receiver.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;Well, maybe my use of &quot;coupling&quot; needs a little clarification, or perhaps
<br />
a better term should be used. This issue is crucial, however, because I find
<br />
the role of energy (its fluxes or balance) to be a fundamental discriminator
<br />
between force-field driven and information-based interactions (in addition
<br />
to the distinct roles of initial conditions and continuity). The key
<br />
question is: Where does the energy involved in the interaction come from? In
<br />
a purely physical interaction between two bodies, that energy is provided
<br />
by, or through, the interaction process itself, whereas in an
<br />
information-driven interaction the energy needed for the interaction must be
<br />
delivered (or absorbed) locally from separate sources at both ends and in
<br />
the &quot;transmission line&quot;. In the first case, the unique correspondence
<br />
between &quot;pattern&quot; at the source (e.g., in my example of the asteroid, the
<br />
details of its odd shape) and the &quot;change&quot; effected in the recipient body
<br />
(the satellite's orbit) is mediated by the peculiarities of energy coupling
<br />
&quot;one-by-one&quot; (i.e., by the details of the gravitational potential); in other
<br />
words, the energy itself is the controlling factor. In the second case, the
<br />
correspondence between pattern (in my example of the dog, the obstacle) and
<br />
the change (the dog changing its course) is controlled by information, not
<br />
energy.&quot;&quot; 
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(2) This is really a minor quibble---and, as I say, I think your examples
</em><br />
are great---but without a little elaboration, someone might take away the
<br />
impression that true information use is tied intrinsically to brains, since
<br />
you use the dog as your example of the transition from force-type
<br />
interactions to information-type interactions. I believe that the
<br />
information-type interaction is an essential feature of life as such, and
<br />
that the bacterium is interacting with its environment (and indeed its
<br />
internal parts are interacting with each other) according to essentially the
<br />
same principles that the dog uses in circling around the obstacle. I assume
<br />
that you will agree with this (no?)&gt;&gt;
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;Indeed, I do. To clarify this, I have now added in the text of my paper
<br />
the example of a paramecium or an amoeba guided by a salinity gradient in
<br />
its movement. (And I'd love to also find a biomolecular example!)&quot;&quot;
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(3) Finally, you write (also in paragraph 3) &quot;Note that this class of
</em><br />
interactions must evolve; they cannot arise spontaneously in the abiotic
<br />
world.&quot;. First, if we are naturalists, we must assume that such interactions
<br />
DID evolve spontaneously in the abiotic world, even if we have no idea at
<br />
present how this was possible.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;Why? Couldn't there have been a sort of transition period involving
<br />
prebiotic processes of replication, etc. of macromolecules, that later
<br />
started organizing their environment in ways that depended less and less on
<br />
energy-driven processes and more and more on patterns (trigger-dependent
<br />
processes)? Maybe I should say in the sentence you quoted:&quot;...they cannot
<br />
appear spontaneously in their final form in the abiotic world&quot;&quot; 
<br />

<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;2. Your remarks about 'purpose' bring us back to the problem of Maturana's
</em><br />
frog. The frog's interaction with the environment by trapping an insect with
<br />
its tongue is hard-wired - not a deliberate act based on spatial perception.
<br />
There is no intentionality - we simply ascribe it to the interaction. To
<br />
assume purpose here is nursery teleology&gt;&gt;
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;True, the neural system involved is mostly hard-wired, but why do you say
<br />
that it is 'not a deliberate act based on spatial perception'? The frog's
<br />
action is indeed more &quot;automatic&quot; (robotic) than us eating ice cream, but I
<br />
would say that the purpose here is also hard-wired: a genetic command to eat
<br />
whenever the opportunity arises! (This is what also sits in our own limbic
<br />
system, see section 6 of my FIS paper, but it can be overruled by other
<br />
real-time input).
<br />
<p>I really would like to see an organized discussion of the concept of purpose
<br />
or intentionality (I suppose they are the same). Anyone out there who has a
<br />
good definition for &quot;purpose of a given action&quot;? I think it's not enough to
<br />
say &quot;the end-state of a system which without that action could never be
<br />
achieved&quot; (as I think I did in my paper), because that really also includes
<br />
all physical interactions between inanimate systems which don't have a
<br />
&quot;purpose&quot; in the commonly accepted sense.&quot;&quot;
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;IMO my dog does not make decisions (although I agree with Fred Dretske
</em><br />
that it can 'know' where it has left its ball)&gt;&gt;
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;I propose a couple of experiments with Imo. Place him before three bowls
<br />
with food. In the first experiment, put the same food and same amount in
<br />
each one. In the second experiment, put different amounts of the same food;
<br />
in the third, put three different kinds of food. I would predict that in
<br />
each case, Imo will definitely make a decision. In the first case, it will
<br />
be most probably random. In the second it will be &quot;limbic&quot; or hard-wired
<br />
(going to the bowl with the largest amount, if he was hungry); in the third
<br />
experiment the choice will be cortical, i.e., going to the bowl with the
<br />
food he likes best according to past experience.
<br />
<p>This has brought me to Pedro's (and Peter's) references to decision-making.
<br />
I think that only a neural information system can make decisions. Do you
<br />
agree? Here again I'd like to see a good definition of &quot;decision-making&quot;.
<br />
Decision is an action that obviously appears when there are alternatives. I
<br />
see decisions that are purely random (see Imo's first experiment); decisions
<br />
that are based on the distant past (inherited choice, Imo's second case);
<br />
decisions that are based on the ontological past (based on experience or
<br />
learned information); and, only in humans, decisions based on the future
<br />
(based on long-term predictions-see section 7 of my FIS paper).&quot;&quot;
<br />
<p>Sorry for the long reply!
