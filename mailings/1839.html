                    HELLO FRIEND,
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>I am MR GODWIN OBOH, Bank Manager of union bank of nigeria plc.
                    <br />
                    I apologize for using this medium to reach
                    <br />
                    you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is
                    <br />
                    due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.
                    <br />
                    Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were
                    <br />
                    given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion
                    <br />
                    Council who was at the Government delegation to your country
                    <br />
                    during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential
                    <br />
                    co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
                    <br />
                    hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep
                    <br />
                    it as confidential because of the nature of this transaction .
                    <br />
                    I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for
                    <br />
                    you. On March 25, 1999, a Canadian Oil
                    <br />
                    consultant/contractor with
                    <br />
                    the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc
                    <br />
                    made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,
                    <br />
                    valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my
                    <br />
                    branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
                    <br />
                    forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a
                    <br />
                    reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,
                    <br />
                    the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine
                    <br />
                    Blanc died in a very fatal auto crash with his driver on a business trip by raod.
                    <br />
                    On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will,
                    <br />
                    and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I
                    <br />
                    therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.
                    <br />
                    Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his
                    <br />
                    official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my
                    <br />
                    Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank
                    <br />
                    and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at
                    <br />
                    the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
                    <br />
                    According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years,
                    <br />
                    the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
                    <br />
                    Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
                    <br />
                    Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an
                    <br />
                    Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so
                    <br />
                    that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the
                    <br />
                    hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I
                    <br />
                    will like you to provide immediately your full names and address
                    <br />
                    so that i put you in place as the next of kin. We
                    <br />
                    shall employ the services of an attorney in your favor for the
                    <br />
                    transfer. A bank account either newly created or existing in any
                    <br />
                    part of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate
                    <br />
                    the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of
                    <br />
                    kin./
                    <br />
                    The money will be paid into your account or moved as a diplomatic
                    <br />
                    consignment in case to a safe country for further claim for us to share in
                    <br />
                    the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to
                    <br />
                    offset any expenses incurred during the entire processing.
                    <br />
                    Please your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate
                    <br />
                    enough. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this
                    <br />
                    transaction will be done by the Attorney, and my position as the
                    <br />
                    Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this
                    <br />
                    transaction.
                    <br />
                <p>If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private
                    <br />
                    email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide
                    <br />
                    you with more details that will help you
                    <br />
                    understand the transaction.

                <p>Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that
                    <br />

                    country. I am awaiting your urgent reply
                    <br />
                <p>However, after your initial response by email, I would suggest

                    that you contact me via phone 234-8037180572, for a verbal and
