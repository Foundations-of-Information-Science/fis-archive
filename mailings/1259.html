<p>(PART II)
<br />
For FIS discussion  with start 22.Jan. 2004  by Søren Brier, Management,
<br />
Politics and Philosophy, Copenhagen Business School, sbr.lpf&#64;cbs.dk
<br />
<p>I have beeen told that interleaving remarks is not favored in Fis. However,
<br />
it  impossible for me to technically comment on parts of this text without
<br />
doing so.  Only in this way can I make specific points.
<br />
STAN
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, first some general comments:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that, while Nature is not a machine, cybernetics is a
<br />
mechanistic mode of thinking (although second order cybernetics tries to
<br />
get away from this), while Peircean semiotic is less so when using its more
<br />
general categories.  As these categories become elaborated, however, they
<br />
become more precise, and, therefore, more mechanistic as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word 'heterarchy', in earlier meanings was meant to convey a
<br />
messiness of Nature when it was attempted to fit the scale hierarchy model
<br />
over it.  My point is that hierarchy is a model, which fits, to some degree
<br />
or other, many aspects of Nature, but not necessarilly all.
<br />
<p>Søren said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1.Levels emerge through emergent processes when new holons appear through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher level organization. These principles can be placed into a Peircean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective, where potentialities (Firstness) are processes manifested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through constraints and forces (Secondness), into regularities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;patterns (Thirdness). This process is continuing in a recursive manner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from level to level. The new emergent level then acts as a potential for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the development of the next level.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: The way this is stated, it implies that levels emerge in a pattern
<br />
of one on top of the next. This is materially impossible.  I have argued
<br />
(Salthe, 1986, Evolving Hierarchical Systems) that new levels always emerge
<br />
between pre-existing ones.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Levels can form and dissolve when their dynamical parameters are near
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;critical points, like when nucleons form and dissolve in a &#x201c;quark soup&#x201d;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stabilization requires that the system moves further from the critical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point into organizing patterns, like energy wells.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: It is my view that stability is anchored to larger scale
<br />
constraints from higher levels.  These foster the emergence, and preserve
<br />
it as long as they remain in effect.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;6. ... Machines lack autopoiesis, reproduction, code-duality, and an inner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organization of membranes, and thus also lack both individually- and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species-based motivation and intentionality and therefore consequently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also the ability to establish a genuine interpretant.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Well, if these properties (autopoiesis, code-duality, etc.) can be
<br />
fully and explicitly stated or modeled, then they would be mechanistic.
<br />
Membrane organization may not be fully describable, nor motivation and
<br />
intentionality.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;8. Meaning is most manifest in the living systems that fulfill
</em><br />
Hoffmeyer&#x2019;s conditions. But starting from dissipative systems, one can
<br />
define a heterarchy of pre-living self-organized systems as based on
<br />
degrees of closure, asymmetry between inside and outside, protocomunication
<br />
over membranes, digital representation and formation of interfaces.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: It is important to note that living systems derive from abiotic
<br />
ones, and so whatever properties they have must have had precursors in the
<br />
ancestral abiotic systems.  We will never understand the origin of life
<br />
without this consideration.  Note that, as evolution proceeded into the
<br />
sociocultural level, the ability to be more fully explicit increased:
<br />
{abiotic -&gt; {biotic -&gt; {cultural }}}. This can be viewed as a development
<br />
of increased definiteness (over, it must be said, a smaller and smaller
<br />
portion of Nature).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;a) A primary chaotic level of continuity, quality, and potentiality, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the tendency to form habits (Firstness). This would include the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vacuum field as it is conceptualized by modern physics as one aspect only.
</em><br />
b) A &#x201c;causal&#x201d; level of matter, energy, and causality by natural forces
<br />
(Secondness and its &#x2018;brute force&#x2019;). The level of efficient causation much
<br />
connected with physics.
<br />
c) An informational cybernetic system level of quasi-semiotic signals that
<br />
encompass the goal-oriented mechanical systems described by first-order
<br />
classical cybernetics. Described from a cybersemiotic view, concepts of
<br />
information as signals of differences make sense only when interpreted as
<br />
quasi-signs. This is the level of formal causation much connected with
<br />
chemistry and the level of reflexes in the body. d) The semiotic level
<br />
belonging to all living systems (biosemiotics) and is much connected with
<br />
biology. The living systems are the basis of true triadic semiosis --
<br />
producing signification spheres in sign games. This level encompasses the
<br />
work of Uexküll (1934) and ethologists such as Lorenz (1970-1971, 1973) and
<br />
Tinbergen (1973) within a broad semiotic framework. This is the level where
<br />
unconscious final causation dominates.
<br />
e) The level of conscious languaging systems (language games, arguments) is
<br />
so far occupied only by the social realm of humans and their culture. Here
<br />
final causation is full-blown in self-consciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: These levels look to me like integrative levels in a specification
<br />
hierarchy: {physical world {material/chemical world {biological world
<br />
{sociopolitical world}}}}, not the scalar levels talked about above.  I
<br />
think it is important to keep track of what we are making here.  These two
<br />
hierarchies can both be applied to any system, but it helps clear thinking
<br />
to distinguish them -- especally since they have different properties (see
<br />
Salthe, 2002, General Systtems Bulletin 31:13-17.).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sign-making is thus immanent in nature, but manifest only in full triadic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;semiosis within autopoietic living systems.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I contest this.  It is manifest in abiotic dissipative structures,
<br />
but in much vaguer, even episodic, form
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Brier.pdf&gt;pdf Questions:
</em><br />
1.Can&#x2019;t we avoid the metaphysics?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: There is a metaphysic involved in so-called avoiding M.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2.Is a theory of levels really necessary?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: It depends upon what we wish  a theory to show, and how we wish to
<br />
show it.  You could have a network model instead if you like.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. Aren&#x2019;t we supposed to keep mind and meaning out of scientific theories?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: That is science as it has been -- the handmaiden of technology,
<br />
with entirely pragmatic aims.   Complexity science already has escaped
<br />
instrumental purposes!
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;6. Is final causation a scientific concept?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I have made it out to be (I have a short MS on this for any who
<br />
would like to see it), but not for science as it HAS been.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;7. Is it possible to define science on another basis than the mechanistic?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Again, I think so, but this brings in finality, internalism,
<br />
vagueness, semiotics, etc.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;8. If we have given up the belief in a universal mechanistic science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shouldn&#x2019;t we then avoid grand schemes like the intended her as they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unscientific in their base.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: In my view what is to be avoided is full explicitness in modeling.
