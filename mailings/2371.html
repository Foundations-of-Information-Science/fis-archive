Hi Marcin and Richard, 
<br />
<p>Thank you for focusing on the core of the work. I have tried to find the
<br />
main points of Marcin's &quot;general question&quot;, which in a way is an answer to
<br />
Richard's wish for a definition of information.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Let me republish those statements in Marcin's posting to which I would like
<br />
to add my opinion. For didactic reasons, I have changed the sequence of the
<br />
thoughts Marcin raises.
<br />
<p>Q: &quot;I strongly believe that only a definition of information based on the
<br />
concepts with firm philosophical foundations can be of any value for the
<br />
development of information science. This is why I have proposed probably the
<br />
oldest, and for sure thoroughly examined philosophical problem 
<br />
of &quot;one vs. many&quot; as a background for the concept of information. &quot;
<br />
A: The definition of information which will in my opinion survive the next
<br />
few years is: &quot;information is that what we neglect as we conduct an
<br />
addition&quot; or &quot;For any given collection of parts, information is the extent
<br />
of the deviation of the probability for the given collection of parts to the
<br />
probability of the most usual collection of parts.&quot;
<br />
This approach presupposes a-priori gravitational centers for parts. Up to
<br />
now, we established the properties of the collection by taking the property
<br />
of its &quot;unit element&quot; (the least individuated element, the unit most devoid
<br />
of properties) and multiplied by the number of units. So we say conceptually
<br />
7 = 7*1. In the new approach, we take NOT the unit element, but the - new
<br />
concept - &quot;central element&quot; as the most representative of all of the
<br />
elements. The distinction between the unit element and the central element
<br />
is of first importance. 
<br />
The central element is the element with the most probable collection of
<br />
properties. It will be a part of the most probable summand/s and carry the
<br />
most probable number and kinds of symbols (in fact, it will carry only
<br />
fractions of a distinguishing symbol, but this fraction is &gt; 0.)
<br />
So, we see a deviation in the result. It does make a difference whether we
<br />
calculate the properties of a set based on the idealised unit or the most
<br />
probable unit.
<br />
The central element is to be thought as that {unit, fish, bird, person, ...}
<br />
that is in the midst of the swarm. The cross-hair of the most probable
<br />
properties gives one the type, properties and place - and therefore density
<br />
- of the central element. (One can demonstrate the typical unit on the left
<br />
side of an = in an addition to have statistical properties, these
<br />
transcending both the individual addition and the result of the addition.)
<br />
Hope that the idea has gotten across:
<br />
A: yes, there is a definition of information.
<br />
B: each actual state we encounter is as much full of information as it is
<br />
deviating to the most probable state.
<br />
C: the most probable state is devoid of information: it is the origo,
<br />
etalon, the reference point itself.
<br />
D: the element incorporating (realising) the most probable state is called
<br />
the central element. It is conceptualised as the mass point (schwerpunkt) of
<br />
a swarm. Relative to this, the others are &quot;somehow otherwise&quot;, that is:
<br />
possessing a degree of information.
<br />
<p>Q: &quot;The reference to biological taxonomy brings another argument for
<br />
informational taxonomy. ... It can help in the development of information
<br />
science. ... if a genus/species definition of information is just an option,
<br />
why should we expect that a taxonomy of information can help.  ...
<br />
I am looking for the definition in this classical genus/species 
<br />
(or genus/differentia) form. I have formulated in this form the definition
<br />
which I have proposed ...&quot;
<br />
A: We find the central element by superimposing statistical search routines
<br />
on each other. (find the most usual /age, weight, hair colour, .../ and the
<br />
person/s agreeing to all these is/are the central element). Each cut is a
<br />
first-order cut. (Grouping people acc to the probability of their birthday
<br />
is as legitimate as acc to the probability of their earnings.) Second-order
<br />
cuts split the first-order subsets. (Sunday-born people earn more than
<br />
Friday-born people, or, in the highest quintile of earnings there are
<br />
disproportionately more Sunday than Monday people, etc.) The disparity
<br />
between the most dense and the second-most dense subsegment is where the
<br />
importance lies. The cuts &quot;between&quot; two first-order cuts are cuts of the 2nd
<br />
order. There is a clear hierarchy among cuts, with a few equally legitimate
<br />
readings of the order of cuts. 
<br />
<p>Q: &quot;The mutual relations of concepts related to information are important
<br />
for its understanding. It is some form of looking for understanding
<br />
information from the (conceptual) inside. ...   However, I think that more
<br />
important is to find an appropriate perspective on the concept of
<br />
information from the outside. How is the concept of information related to 
<br />
the other concepts?&quot;
<br />
A: In my opinion, we pay now the price for having idealised uniformity over
<br />
diversity. (Animals with a CNS that remembers /=re-recognises, =discovers
<br />
similarities, =prefers uniformity signals over diversity signals/ do have a
<br />
reproductive advantage, so we are hard-wired to prefer similarity to
<br />
diversity.)
<br />
De-constructing all that what we have built up without regard to the
<br />
diversity component in concatenations of units will be a long and
<br />
complicated affair. The reverse engineering happens most usefully by
<br />
re-building from the bottom up, by evolving the concept of units and
<br />
operations based on diversity.
<br />
<p>Q: &quot; ... naive and incorrect belief that the more general concept we want to
<br />
define (information is such a general concept,) the more &quot;common sense&quot;
<br />
concepts should be used in explanation (definiendum.) ...  This is the
<br />
reason why so popular is an &quot;explanation&quot; of information by &quot;uncertainty&quot; 
<br />
(originally, probably because of its &quot;scientific&quot; association with quantum
<br />
mechanics and the Uncertainty Principle.)&quot;
<br />
A: Quite often, it is not the intrinsic truth of a thought that will
<br />
determine whether it will be a culturally accepted axiom, but some other
<br />
aspects as well. The self-evident truths seldom contradict common sense. On
<br />
the opposite, it is rather the definitions - decrees, dogmas - which may
<br />
evolve away from common sense and obvious reason.
<br />
It is much more trendy, jazzy and splashy, not to speak of Wow! effect of
<br />
fame and richesse if you find an audience where you can feed them with
<br />
highly complicated nonsense, than a simple and obvious, self-evident truth.
<br />
The contortions of tortured minds come up with ideas like the  uncertainity
<br />
principle, quantum esoterics and affinity of informed agents towards each
<br />
other unless they are noble, in which case they refrain from interaction
<br />
with the non-noble. Our concepts about the world are filled up to the hilt
<br />
with religious and anthropomorphic (animalistic) ideas (like centri-fugal
<br />
forces /=fleeing the center, like a criminal flees a jail/). 
<br />
It is much less poshy to say that we have been conned into a make-believe
<br />
world of uniformity with absolutely no individuality of the units. Diversity
<br />
matters, and if the scientists make themselves a world in which there is no
<br />
diversity, they play peek-a-boo with themselves.  
<br />
In psychology, we have a term: &quot;artefact&quot;. This describes the effects of the
<br />
surroundings, requisites, circumstances of an experiment. Quite many of the
<br />
findings of science appear to turn out to be the effects of the artefact
<br />
that we discount diversity without giving a thought to the costs of doing
<br />
so. Like there is no free lunch, there is no standardisation without loss of
<br />
individuality/diversity. If we standardise into well-behaved,
<br />
undistinguishable units with no individual properties and expect collections
<br />
of such to behave as we expect, then we are perplexed that things happen
<br />
which should not happen if every unit was as devoid of individuality as we
<br />
decreed them to be. One can build himself a lovely world of illusions, it
<br />
just does not fit into reality. The deviation between reality and how I
<br />
expect it to be is not mysterious at all. It is my expectations which were
<br />
too much overidealised. 
<br />
To re-callibrate our concepts in order to find them aligned BOTH with
<br />
similarity and diversity, we should begin a reverse engineering task. A kind
<br />
of &quot;truth and reconciliation commission&quot; would be in order, in science, too.
<br />
Let us hope FIS will turn out to be one of the seeds for a more realistic
<br />
view of science.
