<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. ENTERING THE OBSERVER. In most branches of science  the observer is left 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out the picture (eg, mechanics, Shanon's communication theor., economics) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notwithstanding the curious, and very different, idealized properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he/she may be endowed. But in info science the observer intrudes into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;picture quite crudely (e.g., meaning)... and so the mess. My contention is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that if he/she enters with the usual, idealized properties, it means the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;end of the interesting business ­the different reductionist approaches to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;info finally win the day. But if the observer is admitted within sort of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'limited prehension' framework (superseding the 'principle of rationality' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so dear for physicists--Anderson, Gell-Mann), a few curious consequences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may follow. I have briefly explored this issue regarding the info dynamics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the sciences and the emergence of interdisciplinary overlappings, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow it becomes an expansion on what is contemporarily called in AI &amp; AL 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'swarm intelligence', or a new version of Ortega y Gasset's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspectivism... I was reminded the theme by some recent comments (Gyuri 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Juan) about info and the limitations of the observer in physics itself, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and by Koichiro's comments on book-keeping. But apart from us, limited 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human observers, at least another couple of paradigmatic observers have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enter into the info science picture: cells and firms... Economist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Schumpeter 'creative destruction' in economic systems becomes quite an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting piece of reflection about the structural peculiarities inherent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in these informational observers. 
</em><br />
<p><p>Dear Pedro 
<br />
Your theme &quot;entering the observer&quot; addresses several interesting 
<br />
items, among them the horizon of observers and the risk of 
<br />
reductionism that the observer introduces in info sciences. Let me
<br />
try to join these two points vs the degree of complexity addressed. 
<br />
I agree with you that the horizon of observers is wide: from cells 
<br />
to firms, including  insects (swarm intelligence) and humans. And 
<br />
perhaps the spectrum could be widened even more with your other
<br />
theme &quot;molecular recognition&quot; (assuming we can consider 
<br />
molecule as an observer. Would you ?).
<br />
Now, regarding the risk of reductionist approaches to info entering
<br />
the game, I also agree with you about the reality of that risk, 
<br />
especially when pointing at the notion of meaning. But with so wide
<br />
an horizon of covered items, I feel the risk can be managed. And 
<br />
one can estimate that there is place for several different models of 
<br />
observers, so avoiding being taxed of reductionism. The question 
<br />
will then be about the coverages of the proposed models and about
<br />
the completeness of used hypothesis.
<br />
For cells or insects, I believe we can look at them as 
<br />
&quot;living machines&quot; and find some ways to modelize them as 
<br />
observers with little risk of reductionism. 
<br />
When we reach the level humans (sorry for the gap...), then 
<br />
comes for sure a risk of reductionism: modelization of human
<br />
as observer is not possible today. I mean  globally. Our
<br />
ignorance about the nature of human brings us to  address 
<br />
only limited and very partial possible models. This because we
<br />
do not understand the nature of reflected consciousness, of
<br />
emotions, of free will, and so. Philosophy, neurosciences, 
<br />
psychology, cognisciences and others are still turning around
<br />
these subjects, looking for a way in. The &quot;hard problem&quot;...
<br />
But coming back to the level of insects, a simple modelization can
<br />
do it. Like the one proposed for a  &quot;meaning generator system&quot;
<br />
(Information and Meaning. FIS 2002). For instance, pheromone
<br />
smell can be looked at as a signal creating a meaningful
<br />
information in an ant. The meaningful information being 
<br />
&quot;pheromone smell has some positive link with vital constraints to 
<br />
be satisfied, so trail is to be followed&quot;.  
<br />
Now, observer/meaning at the level of human or firms address
<br />
degrees of complexity that have little to do with insects. Other
<br />
models are needed, à priori. But it is interesting (and risky
<br />
reductionism wise) to investigate a possible usage of previous 
<br />
model by transfering the complexity increase to the constraints
<br />
of the meaning generator system. More precisely, by trying to 
<br />
imagine how some new constraints to be satisfied came up during
<br />
the course of evolution. This approach is to be looked as an 
<br />
hypothesis to be validated (not validated as of today).  
<br />
And there may come in also some form of the Schumpeter 
<br />
&quot;creative destruction&quot; you propose to introduce. A constraint
<br />
could be satisfied only at the expense of a new (cheaper) 
<br />
constraint, coming in as more acceptable for the system 
<br />
(group survival vs individual survival, pleasure/reality and 
<br />
Freudian repressions, ...). 
<br />
<p>Many are the Foundations of Information Science...... 
<br />
<p>Regards
<br />
