<br />
<p><p>Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You are invited to a WESS dinner meeting with Professor Stan Salthe
<br />
on Thursday, November 29, 2001, as announced in early October.  Stan,
<br />
a long time member of WESS, is known for his books on Hierarchy
<br />
Theory and Natural Philosophy.   His abstract is included with this
<br />
announcement (see below).
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Stan Salthe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biological Sciences, Binghamton University, NY.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Title:  &quot;Why is there anything?  Why so many kinds of things?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entropy in Natural Philosophy&quot;
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time:	5:30 PM Cocktails
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7:00 PM Dinner
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8:15 PM Speaker
<br />
<p>Place:	Les Halles Brasserie
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1201 Penn Ave NW
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington, DC, 20004
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(202) 347-6848
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.LesHalles.net
<br />
<p>Please email your reservation to me in a timely manner.  Or, you can
<br />
leave a message on the answering machine at 703-790-1651.  Our
<br />
agreement with our hosts requires us to submit to them a firm number
<br />
of reservations at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting.
<br />
<p>The location of Les Halles Brasserie is about four blocks east of the
<br />
White House, close to the Washington Metro stops of Metro Center and
<br />
Federal Triangle and to several parking garages in downtown
<br />
Washington.
<br />
<p>Guests are welcome.
<br />
<p>Another WESS event is scheduled for December.  WESSbook will meet on
<br />
Saturday afternoon, Dec. 8, 2001 at 1:00 PM in Room 262 at the Reiss
<br />
Science Building on the Georgetown University campus.  The book to be
<br />
discussed is:
<br />
<p>Freedom, Modernity and Islam, Toward a Creative Synthesis
<br />
Syracuse University Press
<br />
By Richard K. Khuri
<br />
Richard will participate in the discussions.
<br />
<p>Guests are welcome at the open discussions of WESSbook.  The
<br />
discussions usually run four or five hours with a lunch break in the
<br />
middle. For further information, please contact either Andrew Vogt or
<br />
myself.
<br />
<p>Friends of Jack Corliss are invited to spend an evening with Jack in
<br />
early December.  Jack, who currently is residing in Hungary, will be
<br />
visiting the Washington area sometime in early December; a special
<br />
notice will be distributed when I have further information.
<br />
<p>Professor Salthe is in Washington to address a annual meeting of the
<br />
American Association of Anthropology.  If you are interested in
<br />
attending this meeting, I have appended an email below which provides
<br />
further information.
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />

<p>Why is there anything?  Why so many kinds of things? Entropy in Natural
<br />
Philosophy
<br />
S.N. Salthe (Biological Sciences, Binghamton University)
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inefficiency of energy gradient utilization (Carnot /Clausius)
<br />
results in a multiplication of energy gradients, and the mutational
<br />
dissipation of embodied information (Brooks and Wiley) generates new kinds
<br />
of consumers.  Together these forces generate an increasing diversity in
<br />
the biosphere -- which should continue as long as the universe keeps
<br />
expanding (Layzer, Frautschi) -- even though each individual dissipative
<br />
structure eventually senesces, hobbled by information overload (Salthe).
<br />
If the universal expansion itself eventually slows, we can expect that it,
<br />
too, will senesce.  The world can be viewed as a dialectic between
<br />
gravitation (the build-up of gradients, embodying information) and the
<br />
Second Law (their destruction, using information, leading to smaller
<br />
gradients).  In this perspective, life is a way of inserting smaller, more
<br />
stable gradients into larger ones -- generating a kind of friction, thereby
<br />
plateauing the destruction of gradients (Lotka), so that we don't burn
<br />
oxidatively so much as we slowly dehydrogenate.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why is there anything? Because the universe is expanding faster
<br />
than it can equilibrate.  Why are there so many kinds of things?  Because
<br />
the universe is trying to destroy as many energy gradients as possible in
<br />
its attempt to equilibrate.
<br />
<p>Stanley N. Salthe; Professor Emeritus, Biology, City University of New
<br />
York; Visiting Scientist in Biological Sciences, Binghamton University.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been breaking out of biology for a long time now. It is too
<br />
constricting a discipline for those who wish to find an intelligible
<br />
understanding of what the world is all about.  Natural philosophy is the
<br />
framework for attempting this, based in scientific knowledge.
