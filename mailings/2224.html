                <p>
                    May I suggest that there is a difference between considering molecular
                    <br />
                    information flows as a chemist or biologist and doing so in the FIS context?
                    <br />
                <p>Dear Ted and colleagues,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    I have always been amazed of the direct link which some natural scientists
                    <br />
                    wish to make between material flows and the information exchange. The latter
                    <br />
                    is a mathematical reflection of the events with a different system of
                    <br />
                    reference.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Take, for example, the classical case of colliding balls. When the physical
                    <br />
                    realization approximates the ideal case, the thermodynamic entropy vanishes,
                    <br />
                    but the redistribution of momenta and energies at the macro-level becomes
                    <br />
                    more pronounced (since there is less dissipation). Correspondingly, the
                    <br />
                    message that the collision has taken place contains a larger amount of
                    <br />
                    information. Thus, the two types of entropy can vary independently: the one
                    <br />
                    may increase and the other vanish in the same event.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    The reason for this independence is that the systems of reference for the
                    <br />
                    two entropies are different: thermodynamic entropy refers exclusively to the
                    <br />
                    distribution of, for example, momenta and positions among particles, while
                    <br />
                    the reference system for probabilistic entropy in this case is the system
                    <br />
                    which conserves macroscopic momenta and energy. The two forms of entropy
                    <br />
                    production (thermodynamic and probabilistic) stand orthogonally in the ideal
                    <br />
                    case.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    In the case of biological systems, one does not expect independence because
                    <br />
                    these systems are dissipative. However, one analytically should declare the
                    <br />
                    two systems of reference first independently, in order to study their mutual
                    <br />
                    information in the dissipation. Perhaps, I misunderstand this discussion,
                    <br />
                    but please in that case try to explain to me why information exchange is not
                    <br />
                    a mathematical construction, but would be embedded in life (or something
                    <br />
                    substantively like that). It seems to me that if (following Maturana) life
                    <br />
                    is defined as the exchange of molecules, the probabilistic entropy generated
                    <br />
                    is not directly related with nor immediately explanatory for the phenomena.
                    <br />
                    There are several in-between steps to be specified.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    These steps may be very different for different systems of reference (e.g.,
                    <br />
                    biological life or human culture). For example, in the latter case, I expect
                    <br />
                    more anticipatory mechanisms (e.g., the sciences) to be involved than in the
                    <br />
                    former and therefore a different dynamics of the entropy.
                    <br />

                    The Challenge of Scientometrics
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>In the local context, all you have to do is invent a new science that sheds
                    <br />
                    new light on phenomenon that are seen locally, namely in the molecular
                    <br />
                    domain. In the FIS context, you have this seeming impossibility squared.
                    <br />
                    That's because you'll be using this domain to get leverage on the larger
                    <br />
                    problem of an information science that applies at all domains. And more
                    <br />
                    importantly, we'd understand what flows among domains and how.
                    <br />
                <p>Toward this end, I'd like to put an early suggestion for limiting the &quot;bio&quot;
                    <br />
                    semiotic approach a bit. Several smart people here have noted the
                    <br />
                    internal/external problem of meaning and intent when you scale biosemiotics
                    <br />
                    down to elements that apparently cannot reason. So I am very skeptical of
                    <br />
                    Peircian mechanics at the biological level.
                    <br />
                <p>And yet - as with many - I find I cannot abandon the notion of meaning when
                    <br />
                    using that of information.
                    <br />
                <p>So I would ask you (Jerry and Kevin) if we cannot have a limited semiosis.
                    <br />
                    In the following way:
                    <br />
                <p>Generally, we like to think of things that have physical reality as the
                    <br />
                    causal primitives in science. So we think of entities having properties as a
                    <br />
                    first order concern, and those entities are the ones we can see and measure.
                    <br />
                    So even though all our rudimentary physics actually operates by way of
                    <br />
                    fields, we suppose those fields as assigned to or generated by entities. We
                    <br />
                    go so far as to require other entities to be exchanged in field effects.
                    <br />
                <p>And I see this with chemists as well. The assumption is that the molecule is
                    <br />
                    what exists as the primitive agent. If information is exchanged, it must be
                    <br />
                    among these &quot;hard&quot; entities. So we look, for instance at their shape (which
                    <br />
                    I know Jerry will get to), and the structural elements Pedro mentions below.
                    <br />
                <p>Can we posit that the true identity of a molecule is something
                    <br />
                    information-based and that what we see is the text, a text, a representation
                    <br />
                    and not something that some god started his day with? This allows me to
                    <br />
                    swallow the important elements of biosemiotics, and forces me in the
                    <br />
                    direction of inventing new abstractions for the primitives involved.
                    <br />
                <p>And of course, these would be abstractions behind the &quot;text&quot; we see, and the
                    <br />
                    one molecules perceive. Fields and particles then become effects, not
                    <br />
                    something necessarily intrinsic to information flows and bindings.
                    <br />
                <p>So then, brief responses to Jerry, Kevin, Pedro...
                    <br />
                <p>Jerry:
                    <br />
                <p>I am glad you gave us the history. But I think history is the enemy here.
                    <br />
                    The abstractions we blindly accept today were invented in a duller context
                    <br />
                    and to satisfy needs vastly less demanding than FIS requires. I fear too
                    <br />
                    many contributors (one would be too many) will try to stretch one or another
                    <br />
                    old principle to fit this new concern.
                    <br />
                <p>But it is of extreme value in posing a candidate problem. After all, if we
                    <br />
                    are creating something useful, it should solve problems more elegantly than
                    <br />
                    before or describe more crisply or provide for better analytical tools.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>What are the relations between this sort of encoding and other metabolic
                    <br />
                    encoding? In particular, can we imagine a catalytic - type of encoding that
                    <br />
                    parallels the genetic encoding?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>And here we have it. Thanks Jerry.
                    <br />
                <p>Kevin:
                    <br />
                <p>I am so glad I heard your talk in Paris. So I know that when you say
                    <br />
                    &quot;Computer Science,&quot; you mean something larger than the ability to describe
                    <br />
                    things algorithmically. But this notion of &quot;natural computation&quot; implies the
                    <br />
                    logics involved are confined to the relatively simpler logics we normally
                    <br />
                    code for/model within. The first order and probabilistic logics. I think
                    <br />
                    that an unnecessary limitation.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>The simulation relation is central in automata theory and was recast into a
                    <br />
                    category-theoretic framework by Arbib and Goguen (taking different
                    <br />
                    approaches). But the notion of a mapping between a biological system and a
                    <br />
                    formal system, seems to be, at first glance, a category mistake! As soon as
                    <br />
                    one identifies a fragment of nature as a system, one has locked in some set
                    <br />
                    of states, and it is hard to separate the true computational power of a
                    <br />
                    living system from what accrues merely to our conventional state assignment.
                    <br />
                    This is taken up nicely by the philosopher David Chalmers in a response to a
                    <br />
                    very strong statement at the conventionality end by Hilary Putnam. (One
                    <br />
                    could see this as a recasting of the debate in Plato's Cratylus in
                    <br />
                    computational terms!)
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>This tension between the formal and the material seems to lie at the heart
                    <br />
                    of the field of natural computing.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>So we need to reinvent both, yes? Both our formal mechanics of computation
                    <br />
                    and our notions of what the &quot;material&quot; is. In both cases we are dealing with
                    <br />
                    abstraction science and unavoidably category theory, no?
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro:
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>This point is so important! Let me refer to arguments in my presentations
                    <br />
                    ECAP 2005, and FIS 2005. I argued that as a consequence of the peculiar
                    <br />
                    &quot;embodiment&quot; of the biomolecular agents (enzymes), in the study of their
                    <br />
                    function we have to pay attention not only to the strictly functional 'what'
                    <br />
                    dictated in the active site of the enzyme, but also to a series of
                    <br />
                    accompanying processes distributed over different parts of the molecular
                    <br />
                    structure, which may include: modulation by effectors, intracellular
                    <br />
                    transportation, permanent (post-translational) modification, formation of
                    <br />
                    complexes, the time-frames derived from transcription and translation, and
                    <br />
                    finally degradation. So the 'what' of the functional clause should be
                    <br />
                    accompanied by circumstances such as 'how fast', 'where', 'which way', 'with
                    <br />
                    whom', 'when', and 'how long'. The mind-boggling factor is that almost all
                    <br />
                    of these circumstances may be captured within particular parts --MODULES,
                    <br />
                    DOMAINS-- of the enzyme, corresponding to DNA exons &amp; introns, and then
                    <br />
                    become amenable to evolutionary control... this is basically the source of
                    <br />
                    eukaryotic organismic complexity: a &quot;genetic algorithm&quot; decomposable in
                    <br />
                    parallel &quot;logical&quot; clauses that can be explored and solved in independent
                    <br />
                    steps.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>As always, I'm with you, but suspect you fear going to far so don't go far
                    <br />
                    enough. Why not?
                    <br />
                <p>Best, Ted
