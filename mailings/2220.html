                <p>
                    Dear colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>Thanks to Jerry and Kevin for their splendid Opening Text!
                    <br />
                <p>Amidst all the attractive topics raised I will select a few tidbits (there
                    <br />
                    will be plenty of time for more careful explorations).
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. From an informational perspective what would constitute a definitive
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory of the information content of molecular bionetworks?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                <p>In our times, I would say that the &quot;bioinformational&quot; themes have
                    <br />
                    definitely gone beyond the unitary schemes proposed after the adoption of
                    <br />
                    the information metaphor (codes, signals, translation, transduction, etc.),
                    <br />
                    for instance, the case of the so called Central Dogma of molecular biology.
                    <br />
                    In my opinion, important progress towards a more consistent vision will
                    <br />
                    depend on advancements in two strategic sub-fields: molecular recognition
                    <br />
                    on the one side, and &quot;heterogeneous networks&quot; on the other. What is the
                    <br />
                    information content of a single molecule? Beyond Scheider approach to DNA
                    <br />
                    sequences, based on Shannon (Lila Gatlin, in late 60's was the historical
                    <br />
                    pioneer), and I would say that some stuff presented in this list is really
                    <br />
                    promising: Shu Kun Lin on measuring &quot;molecular similarity&quot;, and
                    <br />
                    posthumously Michael Carlton on counting the bits of non-periodic molecular
                    <br />
                    structures (John Holgate). Symmetry is a crucial avenue to advance these
                    <br />
                    conceptualizations --Michael Leyton's, Gyuri's...
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Early in the history of biology, organisms were classified based on
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;categories, more or less following Aristotelian conceptualization of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Phyphrian trees, choices of potential properties. The ten Aristotelian
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;categories, the ten highest genera are listed as: substance, quantity,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;quality, relation, place, time, position, state, and action, being acted
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;on. Biological function is related to these categories. I presume that a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;property of the molecular bionetwork encodes and decodes information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;concerning these genera.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                <p>This point is so important! Let me refer to arguments in my presentations
                    <br />
                    ECAP 2005, and FIS 2005. I argued that as a consequence of the peculiar
                    <br />
                    &quot;embodiment&quot; of the biomolecular agents (enzymes), in the study of their
                    <br />
                    function we have to pay attention not only to the strictly functional
                    <br />
                    &#x2018;what&#x2019; dictated in the active site of the enzyme, but also to a series of
                    <br />
                    accompanying processes distributed over different parts of the molecular
                    <br />
                    structure, which may include: modulation by effectors, intracellular
                    <br />
                    transportation, permanent (post-translational) modification, formation of
                    <br />
                    complexes, the time-frames derived from transcription and translation, and
                    <br />
                    finally degradation. So the &#x2018;what&#x2019; of the functional clause should be
                    <br />
                    accompanied by circumstances such as &#x2018;how fast&#x2019;, &#x2018;where&#x2019;, &#x2018;which
                    way&#x2019;,
                    <br />
                    &#x2018;with whom&#x2019;, &#x2018;when&#x2019;, and &#x2018;how long&#x2019;. The mind-boggling
                    factor is that
                    <br />
                    almost all of these circumstances may be captured within particular parts
                    <br />
                    --MODULES, DOMAINS-- of the enzyme, corresponding to DNA exons &amp; introns,
                    <br />
                    and then become amenable to evolutionary control... this is basically the
                    <br />
                    source of eukaryotic organismic complexity: a &quot;genetic algorithm&quot;
                    <br />
                    decomposable in parallel &quot;logical&quot; clauses that can be explored and solved
                    <br />
                    in independent steps.
                    <br />
                <p>Jerry, I would appreciate if could you expand the above reference to
                    <br />
                    Aristotle. The parallel with the circumstances of the enzyme embodied
                    <br />
                    function is strikingly close!
                    <br />
                <p>Well, several paragraphs, in Kevin's are addressing this very problem from
                    <br />
                    a different angle. Let me remind a term used by Michael Conrad on the
                    <br />
                    &quot;unpicturability&quot; of the enzyme function---nevertheless it is amenable to
                    <br />
                    evolutionary control, as it is &quot;represented&quot; into a sequence of &quot;symbols&quot;
                    <br />
                    in the DNA stuff, but see better below:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This tension between the formal and the material seems to lie at the heart
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the field of natural computing. The work of Michael Conrad emphasized
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the special role of biological material to explain the fantastic outcomes
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of evolution, as opposed to any power inhering in the class ofrelatively
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple Darwinian algorithms. In the mutation-absorption model of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;enzyme, we can begin to see how computational power emerges from the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;breakdown in the simulation relation...
                    </em><br />
                <p>Kevin, in the comparison between the enzyme and the integrated circuit, say
                    <br />
                    between the cell and the computer, I wonder whether we could put into very
                    <br />
                    simple terms the crucial differences (the tradeoffs analyzed by Conrad
                    <br />
                    could be illuminating). The widespread assumption of &quot;functionalist&quot; thesis
                    <br />
                    on the separability between hardware and software, often translated
                    <br />
                    literally into the biological (particularly in neuronal &quot;info
                    <br />
                    processing&quot;--see the Churchlands) perhaps relies on the lack of robust
                    <br />
                    metaphors at the other side, on generalities raised in abstract ways... or
                    <br />
                    real cul-de-sacs (eg, autopiesis).
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One final introductory thought. In imputing computing to a fragment of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature -- a ribosome, say -- we should not view ourselves as reducing it
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the apparently impoverished level of a Turing machine or a Pentium 4.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Computer Science is in its infancy; the ribosome, the cell, the ecosystem:
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;these are all better exemplars of computational wonder than our humble
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;devices. If only we had a theory&#x2026;
                    </em><br />
                <p>I completely agree. My contention is that we are in front of one the majors
                    <br />
                    problems of our pretended information science.
                    <br />
                <p>Again, Thanks for the &quot;food for thought&quot;!
