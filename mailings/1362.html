&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleagues,
<br />
<p>What do we know about this author?  Has he ever participated in any of fis 
<br />
discussions?  He seems to support fis-germane  concepts.

<p>Information: The New Language of Science
<br />
by Hans Christian von Baeyer
<br />
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: 2003. 258 pp. £16.99
<br />
<p><p><p>What is the Universe made of? A growing number of scientists suspect that 
<br />
information plays a fundamental role in answering this question. Some even 
<br />
go as far as to suggest that information-based concepts may eventually fuse 
<br />
with or replace traditional notions such as particles, fields and forces. 
<br />
The Universe may literally be made of information, they say, an idea neatly 
<br />
encapsulated in physicist John Wheeler's slogan: &quot;It from bit&quot;. Others 
<br />
rather less boldly suggest that taking a point of view based on information 
<br />
theory may yield insights into existing theories such as statistical 
<br />
mechanics and quantum mechanics.
<br />
<p><p><p>These are speculative ideas, still in the early days of development. Their 
<br />
most encouraging success is perhaps the resolution of the 'Maxwell's demon' 
<br />
paradox, a century-old riddle in the foundations of statistical mechanics. 
<br />
In James Clerk Maxwell's paradoxical thought experiment, a demon of 
<br />
extraordinary dexterity and visual acuity partitions an initially 
<br />
homogeneous gas into two parts, one part containing slow-moving molecules 
<br />
and the other part faster-moving ones. In the thought experiment, the gas 
<br />
is initially spread evenly through a two-chamber container with a 
<br />
connecting trapdoor that can be opened and closed by the demon. By 
<br />
carefully observing the velocity of molecules approaching the trapdoor, and 
<br />
opening or closing it as appropriate, the demon sorts the molecules so that 
<br />
fast molecules enter one chamber and slow ones end up in the other.
<br />
<p><p><p>The resulting system is more ordered than the original homogeneous gas, and 
<br />
so has lower entropy. Furthermore, by making the trapdoor sufficiently 
<br />
lightweight, the demon can operate it by expending an arbitrarily small 
<br />
amount of energy. Thus, a naive analysis suggests that Maxwell's demon 
<br />
reduces the total entropy of the system, violating the second law of 
<br />
thermodynamics.
<br />
<p><p><p>This paradox was resolved in 1982, when physicist Charles Bennett, building 
<br />
on earlier work by others, notably Rolf Landauer, showed that this analysis 
<br />
fails to take into account an entropy cost associated with the information 
<br />
acquired by the demon when it observes the velocities of molecules 
<br />
approaching the trapdoor. The cost is an entropic price paid when the demon 
<br />
erases its record of these observations. Remarkably, when this cost is 
<br />
taken into account, the violation of the second law is found to be illusory 
<br />
and the paradox is resolved.
<br />
<p><p><p>A more recent example of information taking a surprising central role in 
<br />
fundamental science is a bold idea known as the holographic principle. 
<br />
Roughly speaking, this states that the correct way to describe a region of 
<br />
space-time is not through a description of fields and forces in the bulk of 
<br />
the volume, as is conventionally done, but through a theory whose elements 
<br />
are defined on the surface of the region. The motivation for the principle 
<br />
comes in part from results about the thermodynamics of black holes 
<br />
suggesting that the information content of a black hole is proportional to 
<br />
its surface area, not its volume. Some researchers hope that the 
<br />
holographic principle will help lead to a quantum theory of gravity, much 
<br />
as Einstein's principle of equivalence helped to motivate the general 
<br />
theory of relativity.
<br />
<p><p><p>These and other examples illustrate the intellectual ferment associated 
<br />
with the role of information in fundamental science. It is against this 
<br />
backdrop that Hans Christian von Baeyer's elegant popular book is set.
<br />
<p><p><p>The book's most appealing feature is its focus on big questions. What is 
<br />
information? What role does information play in fundamental physics? Where 
<br />
else in science does information play a critical role? And what common 
<br />
themes link these areas? Von Baeyer approaches these questions from many 
<br />
angles, giving us a flavour of some of the most interesting answers 
<br />
currently being offered.
<br />
<p><p><p>There is a nice balance between accepted science and speculative ideas. For 
<br />
example, the standard theory of information, proposed by Claude Shannon in 
<br />
the 1940s, is introduced early in the book. However, von Baeyer admits that 
<br />
Shannon's theory has some shortcomings, and provides a flavour of several 
<br />
other approaches to developing information theories, notably quantum 
<br />
information theory.
<br />
<p><p><p>Von Baeyer discusses many fascinating topics in a tour that is broad but 
<br />
not deep, taking in genetics, bioinformatics, quantum computation, the 
<br />
foundations of quantum mechanics, and black-hole entropy. He faces, and on 
<br />
the whole overcomes reasonably well, the difficulty faced by popular 
<br />
science writers of needing to simplify without misleading. However, I did 
<br />
notice several unfortunate minor errors of fact.
<br />
<p><p><p>In summary, von Baeyer has provided an accessible and engaging overview of 
<br />
the emerging role of information as a fundamental building block in 
<br />
contemporary science.
