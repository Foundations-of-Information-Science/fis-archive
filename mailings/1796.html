                <p>Abstract:
                    <br />
                <p>Complexity and European Integration.
                    <br />
                <p>The traditional analysis of European integration follows a neo-realist model
                    <br />
                    which states that integration results from the political will of the
                    <br />
                    states. In this model, the states are rational actors which see the pooling
                    <br />
                    of national sovereignty in particular policy areas as a way to offset their
                    <br />
                    loss of agency in a globalizing economy. An analysis of the introduction of
                    <br />
                    the principle of subsidiarity in the Treaty of Maastricht shows that this
                    <br />
                    analysis is far from satisfactory and that institutionalist analysis offers
                    <br />
                    a better story. Institutionalist analysis presents features that are common
                    <br />
                    in complexity theory, and shows the European Union to have properties
                    <br />
                    similar to those of a complex adaptive system.
                    <br />

                <p>
                <p>Vincent Fruchart, PhD recently completed a doctoral dissertation
                    <br />
                    (Subsidiarity vs. Sovereignty, An Institutionalist Analysis of the Treaty of
                    <br />
                    Maastricht) in Government and Politics (political economy and rational
                    <br />
                    choice) at the University of Maryland at College Park. His earlier
                    <br />
                    degrees were in Political Science (new School for Social Research,
                    <br />
                    NY, Journalism (Ecole Superieure, Lille, Fr., and Economics,also from
                    <br />
                    Lille. As a consultant for the World Bank, Vincent undertook projects
                    <br />
                    in Sub-Saharian Africa, Nepal, Russia, Idonesia and Rowanda.
                    <br />
                    Following his undergraduate studies, he worked as a European
                    <br />
                    journalist. He also has experience in the private sector radio and
                    <br />
                    publishing. (Not to mention his assignment in Casablanca.) He is
                    <br />
                    interested in
                    <br />
                    applying the insights gained from the study of European integration to the
                    <br />
                    field of development and governance.
