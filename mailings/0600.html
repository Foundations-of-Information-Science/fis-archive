<p>
Since my views fit into a pansemiotics (which some on this list call
<br />
pan-informationist), then, I have a few comments on James Barham's
<br />
post.
<br />
<p>J. Barham/Juan said that &quot;in a natural system we cannot have
<br />
'information alone' detached from any interaction process past,
<br />
present or future; information is always there for a
<br />
purpose....structural order alone does not represent information -
<br />
information appears only when structural order leads to specific
<br />
change elsewhere&quot;.  This is basic Aristotle, Peirce...and a modern
<br />
version is Goertzel.  The point is - 'information alone' doesn't exist
<br />
anywhere, unless you define 'information' as Platonic Form or
<br />
structure. And, as pointed out, structure/form/Information
<br />
alone...doesn't exist 'per se'.  Therefore, why does James conclude
<br />
that such a view will not be agreed to by 'pan-informationists'?  Why,
<br />
James, do you think that someone who is a pan semiotician (I prefer
<br />
that term to pan-informationist) - would think that information is a
<br />
'fundamental constituent????
<br />
<p>You state that pan informationists think that information is a
<br />
'fundamental constituent of the universe on an ontological par with
<br />
matter and energy'.  Now - I speak only for myself but I certainly
<br />
disagree with this statement. My view, repeated often enough, is that
<br />
the fundamental constituent of the universe is energy. Period. When
<br />
energy is moved into spatial and temporal relations, which are only
<br />
possible within gradients of energy, then, it is matter. What is
<br />
matter? It is energy that is in measured relations with other
<br />
energy/matter. As such, it is 'informed matter'.  Informed matter
<br />
operates in a variety of states or relations.  Some relations are
<br />
short-term, volatile, operative only in present time. That's 'data'.
<br />
When this volatile energy is 'cooled', so to speak by being organized
<br />
within long term habits, then, it is 'information'. But- informed
<br />
matter is simply matter that is existent in relations to other matter.
<br />
A plant is drawing water from the soil. The water is 'information' to
<br />
the plant, because it is in a particular relation to the plant.
<br />
<p>I think that you are confusing information with 'message'. Two
<br />
different things. That seems to me what you mean by your monadic and
<br />
dyadic interactions. I don't think that anything purely monadic
<br />
exists. I can't imagine what a monadic entity would be. Certainly, in
<br />
the abiotic and biotic world - such a thing can't exist. In the
<br />
socioconceptual realm - well, there are societies, fundamentalist or
<br />
otherwise, that certainly try to inhibit interactions with others.
<br />
They will inevitably collapse.
<br />
<p>You further mention the term  'intrinsic information'. What is this?
<br />
Again, sounds like some Platonic Form.
<br />
<p>I don't think that most scientists view an organism as 'nothing more
<br />
than the sum of its parts'. They aren't vitalists because they are not
<br />
reductionists.
<br />
<p>But - information obviously means different things to us. I don't
<br />
think of it as a message. Messages can be viewed as part of the
<br />
mechanics of information-processing (chemicals inhibiting or promoting
<br />
interactions) and in that state, I would call such messages 'data'.
<br />
Information, to me, is a result of the interaction of data being
<br />
processed and obviously affects both sides of the interaction.  Both
<br />
are 'informed'. I would also agree with Norbert Fenzl, that S is not I
<br />
but S is a condition for I. Very much so. Data is more related to
<br />
entropy, for data is  relatively unbound energy entering a
<br />
system...and can be transformed into information..or not.
<br />
<p>And, there's that all important 'fundamental constant', so to speak -
<br />
the mediative role of Habit, or compressed information, ie,
<br />
Knowledge - that few on this list ever talk about.
