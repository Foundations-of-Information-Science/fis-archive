<p>
Quantum coherence has been demonstrated in the brain
<br />
<p>A new imaging method for MRI is based on detection of quantum coherence
<br />
(Rizi et al, 2000). It turns out that quantum dipole couplings of entangled
<br />
nuclear spins in two molecules (e.g. water, protein) separated by distances
<br />
ranging from 10 microns to one millimeter are detectable in that they give
<br />
a measurable NMR signal. Applied to brain MRI, the technique enhances
<br />
contrast of conventional imaging and give an interesting brain mapping
<br />
which may be relevant to a neural correlate of consciousness.
<br />
<p>This work has been developed by WS Warren and colleagues at Princeton,
<br />
University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and a list of some of their
<br />
references is below. Their goal has been strictly to develop new contrast
<br />
enhancement for MRI imaging, and for this they deserve congratulations.
<br />
They have not considered possible relevance of the quantum coherences to
<br />
brain function (and may not be aware of such proposals). Nancy Woolf at
<br />
UCLA who (among others) does consider quantum processes of possible
<br />
relevance to consciousness noticed the work in its other context. Thanks
<br />
again Nancy. Here are the references, followed by a summary..

<br />
<p>Summary
<br />
<p>NMR and MRI use the magnetic properties of nuclei with spin (essentially
<br />
hydrogen protons) when the nuclei are immersed in a static magnetic field
<br />
and exposed to a second oscillating magnetic field or electromagnetic (e.g.
<br />
RF) radiation. Some nuclei with spins are altered and eventually relax to
<br />
their original orientation giving a measurable signal. The medium and other
<br />
conditions in which the protons find themselves determine the response, and
<br />
hence valuable information about structure and dynamics are obtained.
<br />
<p>In the conventional approach to NMR and MRI, magnetic fields generated by
<br />
the bulk magnetization of the sample's nuclear spins are neglected. (The
<br />
sample may be.a solution of proteins in NMR, or a human brain in MRI.) With
<br />
newer, high strength magnets, bulk magnetization of the sample's protons
<br />
lead to interesting behavior when presented with excitatory pulses of RF
<br />
and/or variations in magnetic field gradient. For example two RF pulses
<br />
generate trains of large amplitude echoes in simple solutions. These
<br />
effects (generally ignored in most approaches) may be described using
<br />
classical physics, however Warren and colleagues have shown the effects are
<br />
better understood as quantum coherence, specifically as &quot;intermolecular
<br />
multiple quantum coherences &quot;('IMQC'). These are detectable because of
<br />
dipole couplings between distant spins; the paired spins are superpositions
<br />
of two eigenstates of the spin system which are separated in energy by more
<br />
than one spin flip.
<br />
<p>The MRI IMQC signal involves flipping up one solute spin with simultaneous
<br />
flipping down of a nearby, quantum entangled solvent spin. (The NMR pulse
<br />
may be viewed as a measurement on an affected spin, causing its entangled
<br />
spin some distance away to simultaneously collapse.) Because the spins are
<br />
on two different molecules, only dipole-dipole interactions would provide
<br />
such a coupling, and this interaction is normally assumed to be averaged
<br />
away by diffusion or thermal noise (&quot;decoherence&quot;). However only the short
<br />
range dipolar couplings are motionally averaged out; the dipolar coupling
<br />
between spins separated by much more than, e.g. the distance molecules
<br />
diffuse on an NMR time scale (~10 micrometers to 1 millimeter) are
<br />
retained. The surviving dipole field generated by a single proton is
<br />
extremely small, less than 10^-16 Tesla at 10 microns, however there are
<br />
10^45 different pairs of spin in a typical 1 ml sample, and with various
<br />
processing steps a robust signal is obtained.
<br />
<p>In human brain imaging (one axial slice is presented) Zizi et al (2000)
<br />
found sites of maximal IMQC
<br />
quantum coherence appearing in periventricular gray, and frontal,
<br />
pre-motor/parietal, and occipital cortex. A measure of the durations of the
<br />
quantum processes were 24.2 msec in the white matter region, 26.0 msec in
<br />
the gray matter region, and 293.8 msec in the ventricular region. (The
<br />
possible relation of white and gray matter durations of around 25 msec to
<br />
&quot;40 Hz&quot; periodicity is interesting). The CSF-containing ventricles (and/or
<br />
periventricular gray matter) are seen in the quantum coherence image, as
<br />
well as a control image of single, non-coupled spins and may reflect a
<br />
'flow' phenomenon. The cortical areas are seen only in the quantum
<br />
coherence image.
<br />
<p>The enhanced contrast quantum coherence MRI imaging is potentially useful
<br />
clinically.
<br />
However if quantum states and processes play a significant role in
<br />
consciousness as many of us believe (e.g. see my website
<br />
www.consciousness.arizona.edu/hameroff), the images may be even more
<br />
interesting. Does this technique take us closer to imaging the neural
<br />
correlate of consciousness?
<br />
<p>The occurrence of quantum coherence in the brain doesn't prove that quantum
<br />
coherence is relevant to consciousness, but it does show that quantum
<br />
coherence can, and does, occur in the brain. This is important as
<br />
consciousness models involving quantum states in the brain have come under
<br />
sharp criticism due to the issue of decoherence, and the question of
<br />
whether quantum processes of significance can exist in the brain at
<br />
physiological temperature. It appears that quantum coherence can, and does
<br />
occur in the brain.
