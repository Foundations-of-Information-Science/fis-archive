Karl,

You commented:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;A context I understand and have understood long ago does not have any thrill any more. The absence of thrill is more marked if I have had great expectations. But the two questions have nothing in common: how much am I no more surprised (to which extent am I blasé) and how practical is that which does no more surprise me. I may very well know the function of a compass and be no more surprised that it turns always towards North, and still I may find it extremely practical.&gt;
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
You raise a very interesting point here by taking us back to fascination, expectation, surprise - 
<br />
in short the abductive quizzicality of the organism discussed by John C and others earlier this year.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The informational is predicated not just on self-organisation (as Wolfgang has well articulated)
<br />
but on self-organised criticality. News is critical noise. If informational experience is a predicate of
<br />
'thrill' rather than cognition of contextualised facts then informational activity and context-bound 
<br />
knowledge (like Carnap's separation of language from semantics) may have 'nothing in common'.
<br />
Maybe it is only when we throw knowledge and reason overboard that we can we have a truly intimate 
<br />
encounter with information...
<br />
<p>The informational quality of an utterance or event may depend (like love and passion) not on its 
<br />
intrinsic truth or falsehood but on its degree of fit with our expectations - this is in contrast to 
<br />
Luciano Florido's alethic rationality. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;So it shouldn't come as much of a surprise were we to discover that a successful formalization of information be almost useless from a practical point of view, yet equally profound from the standpoint of  setting the foundations for a general theory of modelling relations. &gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Isn't that the history of scientific discovery in a nutshell from Archimedes' bath to Newton's putative apple
<br />
and Rutherford's crooked stick? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;Let me propose for the New Year that we achieve ourselves a great experience of dis-illusionment.
<br />
<p>Ein Gluckliches (oder vielmehr Enttauschendes) Neujahr!
<br />

<br />
<p>Dear colleagues, 
<br />
<p>Ted's overall comments have provoked me the following reflection:
<br />
<p>We seem to be working collectively on a puzzle, namely what is information? We experience it as a specific carrier of tension. In general, when we are caught into a communication process, the tension generated by any news is solved as we understand that what has been in a deviation to our expectation. But what we are now trying to understand is precisely the nature of what we experience as 'news'. 
<br />
<p>There is a shift in perception as one experiences the lack of excitement while understanding something. A connex I understand and have understood long ago does not have any thrill any more. The absence of thrill is more marked if I have had great expectations. But the two questions have nothing in common: how much am I no more surprised (to which extent am I blasé) and how practical is that which does no more surprise me. I may very well know the function of a compass and be no more surprised that it turns always towards North, and still I may find it extremely practical.
<br />
<p>The same holds true about a rational access to Information and Life in general. Once I have figured out how the two aspects are interlocked, then two things happen: a) the fascinating puzzle is neither a puzzle any more nor fascinating any more; b) I can use this insight for a lot of practical purposes.
<br />
<p>So it shouldn't come as much of a surprise were we to discover that a successful formalization of information be almost useless from a practical point of view, yet equally profound from the standpoint of  setting the foundations for a general theory of modelling relations. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I would be very happy if FIS discussions could contribute to grasp in a rational way our concepts about systems that change in time and show a nice interaction between cross-sectional and longitudinal ways of containing information. Let me propose for the New Year that we achieve ourselves a great experience of dis-illusionment.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Karl
