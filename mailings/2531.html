                <p>
                    Dear Arne and colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>There is an essential reason, I believe, why nearly all physical
                    <br />
                    scientists are realists. There would be no physical science without
                    <br />
                    realism. Perhaps the most fundamental assumption upon which physical
                    <br />
                    science depends is the conviction that all of us are imbedded in the
                    <br />
                    same, objective physical reality.
                    <br />
                    I understand that one cannot prove this deductively, but the inductive
                    <br />
                    evidence seems, to most of us, to be overwhelming. From the very
                    <br />
                    beginning of physical science, through to the present, all of our
                    <br />
                    scientific accomplishments rely on a description of nature that is
                    <br />
                    observer independent. We�ve incorporated Gallilean relativity into the
                    <br />
                    fundament of classical physics. All the classical equations of motion
                    <br />
                    are observer independent. Would there be anything at all left of the
                    <br />
                    physical sciences if we discarded classical mechanics?
                    <br />
                    It is exactly the consistency and usefulness of the physical sciences
                    <br />
                    that argues, irrefutably, I believe, for the validity of the axioms upon
                    <br />
                    which physical science depends. Statistical mechanics, hydrodynamics,
                    <br />
                    electrodynamics, and others cannot stand without classical mechanics.
                    <br />
                    So, we physical scientists must adamantly refuse to concede that because
                    <br />
                    realism is not deductively derivable, it might not be correct.
                    <br />
                    I note that Einstein built both his theories of relativity, special and
                    <br />
                    general, on the postulate of observer independence. Should we throw out
                    <br />
                    those extraordinarily valuable and consistent theories because we wish
                    <br />
                    to debate the lack of a deductive argument for realism? I�m sure that
                    <br />
                    quantum mechanics (which also employs classical mechanics via the
                    <br />
                    Hamiltonian formalism, Poisson Brackets, etc.) does not imply observer
                    <br />
                    dependence, though some eminent physicists, like Wigner and von Neumann,
                    <br />
                    have read it that way.
                    <br />
                    The accepted understanding of the wavefunction, Psi, was given in the
                    <br />
                    early 1920s by Max Born. As you know, If we wish to calculate the
                    <br />
                    probability for each possible measured value of the system we take the
                    <br />
                    projection of the eigenfunction for that value on the wave function,
                    <br />
                    then calculate the inner product with Psi*. That we are predicting a
                    <br />
                    probability for a measured outcome does not, at all, imply that human
                    <br />
                    consciousness plays any part in the measurement. In fact, as Hawking,
                    <br />
                    Penrose, and so many other physicists have so carefully calculated,
                    <br />
                    there is every reason to believe that quantum mechanics described the
                    <br />
                    cosmos billions of years before any humans and their conscious minds
                    <br />
                    existed.
                    <br />
                    In general, measurement is information exchange between two separate
                    <br />
                    physical objects. Neither object need be human, of course. The canonical
                    <br />
                    model for a measurement that transfers one bit of information is the
                    <br />
                    bi-level atom located along one arm of the Stern-Gerlach apparatus
                    <br />
                    described in 1978 (Physics Reports) by Scully, Shea, and McCullen. When
                    <br />
                    a spinning molecule collides with the bi-level atom, a single quantum of
                    <br />
                    energy is transferred to the atom. This is a real, physical, energetic
                    <br />
                    signal that carries information about the change in energy of the
                    <br />
                    molecule to the atom. Since energy is always conserved, the energy jump
                    <br />
                    in the detector atom always records the exact information about the
                    <br />
                    change in energy of the molecule.
                    <br />
                    One may, of course, still ask how human beings are able to observe
                    <br />
                    properties of our shared physical reality. I�m convinced that at the
                    <br />
                    most basic level of human percepta, more fundamental than learned, or
                    <br />
                    perhaps innate, shapes and objects, we all look at the same pattern of
                    <br />
                    minute color specks and see (and describe) the same specks. The key here
                    <br />
                    is to look only for each speck of color, as one might do to a
                    <br />
                    pointillist painting by Signac, say, ignoring any impression of physical
                    <br />
                    objects that the artist may have portrayed. If necessary, scientists
                    <br />
                    could employ such a basic technique to insure that the pattern which
                    <br />
                    carries information about results of a measurement (like the face of an
                    <br />
                    ammeter, for instance) really is observer independent. I�m convinced
                    <br />
                    that there are no cultually-inculcated tendencies at this most basic level.
                    <br />
                    Cordially,
                    <br />
