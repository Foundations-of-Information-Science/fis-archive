<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>The cumulative attraction of this online discussion, and now especially 
<br />
Pedro's posting of 22 September, has hooked me.  If you can forgive my late 
<br />
intrusion, I would like to try out the following.
<br />
<p>&quot;The non-formal properties of information&quot;: here I believe Pedro is 
<br />
bringing out something extremely important. I wish I could explain clearly 
<br />
why I think this is crucial to the notion of natural computation, but I 
<br />
need to work at it more. Here, though, are some very crude comments in that 
<br />
direction.
<br />
<p>Look at the idea of the imposition of form on substance. What does this 
<br />
mean? Start with a piece of the world. Take, say, a ribosome in a living 
<br />
cell. I mean a specific ribosome, this one, here, under this microscope 
<br />
now. Individual. Particular. Not the type &quot;ribosome.&quot; This sense of 
<br />
&quot;substance&quot; I want to employ here.  (The clumsy phrasing in this paragraph 
<br />
is me trying to distinguish this from the Aristotelian notion of substance 
<br />
as an object of logical predication.)
<br />
<p>This ribosome has a function. Now it is a truism that &quot;function&quot; does not 
<br />
inhere in physical objects, but arises from a network of relationships and, 
<br />
perhaps, an interpretive community. We can, in a suitable frame of mind, 
<br />
look at a thing and ignore its function. What are we looking at? That is, 
<br />
take away function from the ribosome, and what is left?   &quot;Form&quot;. (The 
<br />
answer seems irresistible.) Now take away form, then what is left? 
<br />
&quot;Substance&quot; maybe? Is that really useful? At first, that sounds like some 
<br />
residual meaningless metaphysical ooze-- ousia, in fact. Isn't all of 
<br />
science about form anyway?
<br />
<p>Anything on the level below form seems below scientific discourse, which 
<br />
seeks out form. When we look at something as a scientist, we give it form. 
<br />
It may even become a &quot;system&quot;, with &quot;states.&quot; In computer science, 
<br />
representations of things are the object of study. We might represent an 
<br />
agent, a transaction, or a number, for example. (One thing you tell 
<br />
students in a computer science class is that it is meaningless  to speak of 
<br />
the complexity of testing if a number is a prime number; you must instead 
<br />
speak of the complexity of testing whether a representation of a number is 
<br />
a representation of a prime number. Some representations make it trivial; 
<br />
some make it hard.)
<br />
<p>But in _natural_ computation, things are different. Form, representation, 
<br />
system, state-- in some way we must be able to occasionally bracket these 
<br />
out and speak of substance alone. For example, an evolutionary exaptation 
<br />
happens when one part of a biological substance, which served one function, 
<br />
is recruited for another. The semantics is broken, and re-formed. There is 
<br />
some discontinuity in how we can track change in substance by change in 
<br />
formal representation. (I think the philosopher Hilary Putnam hit on one 
<br />
part of this in his arguments against computational functionalism.)  I 
<br />
believe these &quot;non-formal properties of information&quot;  are at the core of 
<br />
the Conrad tradeoff between computability and amenability to evolution.
<br />
<p>A separate observation: Pedro writes of  looking at the thinker is his/her 
<br />
&quot;spare time, just when he/she is not acting in that peculiar 'scientific' 
<br />
way.&quot;  This evokes Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations 132 in 
<br />
particular), where he points out that the confusions about language that 
<br />
vex us do not occur when language is playing its real-life role (a 
<br />
non-scientific, non-philosophical role-- in Pedro's scientist's &quot;spare 
<br />
time&quot;). The confusions only occur in when language is taken off-line, as it 
<br />
were, disconnected from its role in life, set on a rack ready to be 
<br />
examined. [W's famous negative simile is that of language in this mode 
<br />
being like &quot;an engine idling&quot;.  I just looked up the German text and there 
<br />
is no &quot;engine&quot; mentioned directly: it's just &quot;wenn die Sprache leerlau&quot;ft.&quot; 
<br />
Not being a native German speaker, I don't get the nuances, but the notion 
<br />
of language &quot;running on empty&quot; seems engaging...]
<br />
<p>The privileging of the real-life notion of information connects back to 
<br />
some remarks by Hans several days ago, on the similarities between trying 
<br />
to define information and trying to define energy. In fact, the art in a 
<br />
beautiful loose definition such as (for example) &quot;energy is the ability to 
<br />
do work&quot; is impressive. It is invariant across different sub-notions of 
<br />
energy (Gibbs free energy, Helmholtz free energy&#x2026;) and changing 
<br />
understandings of fixed notions of energy (pre-relativistic vs. 
<br />
relativistic, say).  And its invocation of work hooks it in both to another 
<br />
set of ordinary-life intuitions (I'm using &quot;energy&quot; pedaling this bicycle) 
<br />
and to another physical concept (work) which can also admit further 
<br />
mathematical elaboration. By so neatly injecting the concept into the web 
<br />
of other physical concepts, it helps one do physics. (Ok- I am not a 
<br />
physicist.) This is at least as valuable as a formal definition that gives 
<br />
precise necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be called 
<br />
&quot;energy.&quot; Accordingly, I am a great appreciator of definitions of 
<br />
information such as &quot;reduction in uncertainty&quot; or &quot;difference that makes a 
<br />
difference.&quot; They tie this plural concept into a scientifically useful 
<br />
semantic web. If one wishes to charge into the still-dark territory of 
<br />
&quot;non-formal&quot; information, it is definitions like these that will light the way.
<br />
<p>Anyway, I apologize for the length of this posting, as well as its 
<br />
still-fuzzy content.
<br />
<p>-- Kevin
