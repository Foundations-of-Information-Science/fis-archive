<p>
Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>I am in a difficult situation in this round of discussions (as I already 
<br />
had anticipated to Pedro). I am presently again at the Intl. Centre for 
<br />
Theoretical Physics in Trieste, having to do the work of three weeks in 
<br />
just one, and I am about to leave for Moscow for a meeting and lectures 
<br />
during the next ten days. I will be back home in Alaska only on June 5. 
<br />
Before leaving, however, I do want to make a few statements, hoping that 
<br />
the discussion will still be going on early June.
<br />
<p>I find it difficult under this pressure of time to react clearly and 
<br />
meaningfully to the various comments and statements made thus far. Much of 
<br />
what has been said, quite frankly, I do not understand. As I stated in a 
<br />
previous round last year, I am a humble space physicist and 
<br />
psychoacoustician who is able to work only with clearly defined (and 
<br />
directly or indirectly measurable) concepts. For instance, I am not sure 
<br />
what is meant by &#x201c;genetic music&#x201d; or &#x201c;the relation of the genetic code 
<br />
structure with music&#x201d;. I could think of many other sequences and 
<br />
superpositions of signals in nature for which one can trace analogies with 
<br />
music. In space physics, for instance, we often take the magnetic tape 
<br />
record of a given signal (magnetic, electromagnetic, Alfven wave, etc.) and 
<br />
speed it up or slow it down passing it through a speaker, in order to &#x201c;hear 
<br />
out&#x201d; from among the noise possible periodicities, harmonics, etc. Indeed, 
<br />
our auditory system is, at least qualitatively, a far better periodicity 
<br />
detector than any FFT or related computer program! I can well imagine that 
<br />
if we appropriately code the DNA sequence and &#x201c;play it&#x201d; into our ears, we 
<br />
will be able to discover &#x201c;musical&#x201d; structures. My question here is: So 
<br />
what?? Our auditory system has evolved to discover and identify 
<br />
periodicities and structures in a very sophisticated way. But if we want to 
<br />
relate them to music, we must first try to define objectively, and 
<br />
independently of a particular culture, WHAT MUSIC IS (or, as Rafael says, 
<br />
answer the question &#x201c;When do we perceive a sound as music?&#x201d;). In my 
<br />
background FIS paper I try to pin down some defining characteristics of 
<br />
music---please refer to them. 
<br />
<p>So I ask anyone participating in this FIS discussion to try to address the 
<br />
following defining questions:
<br />
<p>1. Can you explain the role of the almighty octave and chroma?
<br />
2. Can you explain the role of scales and the reason why musical tone 
<br />
sequences proceed in quantized steps?
<br />
3. Can you explain the decreasing sense of consonance as one goes from 
<br />
octave to fifth, fourth, third, etc.?
<br />
4. Can you explain tonality and the sense of return?
<br />
5. Can you explain why &#x201c;abstract patterns of music shake hands with 
<br />
emotional reactions&#x201d; (Pedro)?
<br />
<p>I think that today all of the above can be linked with the particular 
<br />
information-processing operations of the physiological and neural acoustic 
<br />
system (1-4 above) and with the cooperative, coherent interplay between the 
<br />
cognitive (cortical) and affective (subcortical) functions of the human 
<br />
brain (5 above). I would welcome any challenging counter-opinions.
<br />
<p>One more remark that would fit into the above, concerning a statement by 
<br />
Luis Serra. He mentions the effect of major hemisphere stroke traumas 
<br />
leading to loss of speech but leaving unimpaired the perception of music. 
<br />
He views this as an example in favor of the thesis &#x201c;music first, language 
<br />
later&quot;. Well, there are abundant examples of amusias, caused by traumas to 
<br />
the minor hemisphere in musicians who have lost many or all their musical 
<br />
abilities with no impairments of speech and language! Each cerebral 
<br />
hemisphere has separate, but cooperating, information-processing strategies 
<br />
(sequential vs. integral), which, if impaired, have different effects on 
<br />
either speech or music. There is ample literature on this (see also my book 
<br />
Physics and Psychophysics of Music, Pringer Verlag, 1995, last chapter).
<br />
<p>I look forward to participating in the discussion when I return form Russia.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />
<p>Juan
<br />
