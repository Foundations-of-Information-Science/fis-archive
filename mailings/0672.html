<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, I don't agree that category theory is the 'way to go'. I consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that category theory operates within a dyadic rather than triadic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;framework.
</em><br />
<p>Let's look more carefully at the logical structure of a mathematical category.
<br />
<p>A category is not merely a monadic, dyadic or triadic mathematical object.
<br />
<p>A category is a tetradic framework.
<br />
<p>Why is category theory a tetradic framework?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A category operates, at a *minimum*, on four objects (domains and 
<br />
codomains) and three morphisms linking them to one another. Roughly 
<br />
speaking, a category operates concomitantly on three dyadic 
<br />
frameworks, two triadic frameworks and one tetradic framework.
<br />
<p>For example,
<br />
<p>*IF* one chose to define Pierce's &quot;firstness&quot;, &quot;secondness&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;thirdness&quot; as morphisms ,
<br />
*then* one could (possibly) construct a correspondence relation 
<br />
between the semantics of firstness, secondness and thirdness
<br />
*and* the nature of the morphisms of a category.
<br />
<p>Secondly, at issue is the nature of the four objects as related to 
<br />
the three morphisms. A precise logical relation within a category 
<br />
exists between the four objects and the three morphisms such that a 
<br />
logic coherence is generated among the four objects and three 
<br />
morphisms. (For an introductory text on categories, see the book by 
<br />
Lawvere, Conceptual Mathematics.)
<br />
<p>For example, in certain cases, the objects of a category can be 
<br />
logical propositions.
<br />
The case where the objects are propositions has been explored 
<br />
extensively and has led to the a deeper understanding of logic itself 
<br />
as well as a branch of mathematics known as &quot;model theory&quot; which 
<br />
seeks to integrate mathematical concepts over a wide range of 
<br />
mathematical species.
<br />
<p>In another example, I have recently succeeded in developing a model 
<br />
of chemical species directly from the metaphysical primitives of 
<br />
matter, identity, space and time.  Thus it became possible to 
<br />
construct an organic theory of communication based on an organic 
<br />
species as a mathematical species as alluded to within my abstract. 
<br />
This allows one to contrast it with the Shannon engineering approach 
<br />
(which is purely a formal syntactical structure without meaning).
<br />
<p>Tensions between the concepts of semiotics, semantics and syntax are 
<br />
related to  the question of structure and the relations among such 
<br />
structures.
<br />
<p>Within category theory, one has substantial &quot;logical space&quot; to 
<br />
associate semiotic concepts with semantic concepts and with 
<br />
syntactical concepts.  The above example illustrates an approach to 
<br />
resolving the tensions between semiotics and mathematical syntax in 
<br />
terms of associated structures of a category.
<br />
<p>In contrast with other mathematical species (such as vector spaces or 
<br />
fields), a category is grounded on the associative relations among 
<br />
the four objects and three morphisms.  (See Stephan Foldes, 
<br />
Structural Mathematics; this may not be the exact title?)
<br />
<p>Let me close with a note of caution.
<br />
<p>Category theory is a theory of mathematics.  Application of category 
<br />
theory to scientific questions is a very challenging undertaking 
<br />
because of its abstractness and the complex origin of its coherence.
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
