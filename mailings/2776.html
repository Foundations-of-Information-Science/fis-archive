                    <br />
                    that sometimes we focus on form rather than substance, that this

                    accounts for the concept (in fact all the concepts) of information,
                    <br />
                    and that we can call that focus &quot;the formal stance&quot;. I hope I don't

                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; S: The word &quot;experience&quot; here is critical. Our experience (and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; meanings) is engendered by our formal organization. Matter is what is

                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; organized, and so could not itself be the content of experience (or

                <p>Here at last we seem to have unambiguous agreement.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;A mind is a user or processor of intentional information.

                    </em><br />
                <p>Perhaps, I don't think in these terms.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;Matter is a theoretical entity extrapolated from physical information.

                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; S: Presumably &quot;physical information&quot;, then, relates to an
                        array of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; possibilities generated by a situation, from which the formal setup
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; (context) will select some given a nudge informed by an intentional
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1"> &gt; tendency.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Physical information is simply material form. Any physical process
                    <br />
                    involves contextual selection, but a perfectly static arrangement of
                    <br />
                    entities embodies physical information too, by virtue of the fact that
                    <br />
                    it has some form.
                    <br />
                <p>Having looked at your home page, I see we have very different concepts
                    <br />
                    of form. You suggest {energy -&gt; {matter -&gt; {form -&gt; {organization}}}}
                    <br />
                    but I see form as occurring simultaneously with energy, in fact as
                    <br />
                    more-or-less synonymous with quality. Whatever has qualities, has
                    <br />
                    form. Perhaps you limit form to instances of stability?
                    <br />
                <p>I'm fairly confident that matter can reasonably be considered a
                    <br />
                    theoretical entity, but I'm now having some doubts about saying that
                    <br />
                    it's extrapolated from physical information, because it can be argued
                    <br />
                    that we don't have direct access to that either, all we experience
                    <br />
                    being intentional information, so physical information is theoretical
                    <br />
                    too. This needs more thought.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev2"> &gt;&gt;Meaning is intentional information (though multiple levels of

                    </em><br />
                <p>Perhaps, but I think I'm saying rather more than that.
