<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Replying to Stan:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will try to express the idea... Originally Zipf and recently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ramon Ferrer i Cancho, Richard V. Sole (2003) both attribute Zipf's law to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the principle of &quot;least effort&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SS: So, do you mean the physical principle of least action?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;V.: No. It is from Cybernetics. The principle of the least effort says: &quot;a
</em><br />
system will try to adapt to its environment or will try to change the
<br />
environment to suit its needs, whichever is easier&quot; (dictionary of
<br />
Cybernetics and Systems at <a href="../../pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/INDEXASC.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/INDEXASC.html</a>).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now let me translate your question 'how does &quot;data to being plotted as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;power laws suggest systematicity&quot; ?' to 'how can the principle of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least effort relate with systematicity in terms of structure of a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;?' Possible answer... Systems evolve or grow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SS: Not by least effort! They strive mightily to grow.
</em><br />
V.: Let me disagree. Let's compare for example life and an explosion of a
<br />
mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, both from a chemical point of view are
<br />
oxidation processes. Life is an example of oxidation processes controlled by
<br />
a complex well organized system. Meanwhile the explosive oxidation of free
<br />
hydrogen is much more mighty...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they respond to changes in their environment, they have to optimize their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure and performance for optimal functioning (being a structural part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of other systems), or in other words systems communicate with their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environment. Something that is 'not a system' does not 'care' about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;optimization of it's performance, growth, development, adaptation, or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sort of evolution, energy saving (principle of least efforts)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SS: I would like to hear this principle stated in words explicitly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In general there is no &quot;energy saving&quot; in natural systems. They dissipate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;energy gradients as fast as possible.
</em><br />
V.: I would not agree again... The definition of the principle of least
<br />
effort and the comparison of controlled vs. uncontrolled oxidation look like
<br />
saying the opposite. The later dissipate energy gradients much faster
<br />
comparing with much more complex living systems. One could also think of
<br />
difference between controlled nuclear breakdown in power-stations vs.
<br />
uncontrolled blast if to remember our own creations. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or structural change simply because of the absence of any internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organization or structure or feedback loop between the 'non-system' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'random system' and it's environment. Its history should be uniform: no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changes in structure, no development, no growth, no evolution, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function, no communication - no need for the least effort... As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consequence a structure of any system facing the entropy should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organized in such a way as to oppose the II-nd law and optimize its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;performance against energy losses - e.g. the principle of least effort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is true for language also works elsewhere (any other communication).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SS: I disagree with this supposed &quot;least effort&quot; Least action would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have nothing to do with it. It is the smallest integral over velocity,
</em><br />
mass
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and path length. From that you cannot derive energy efficiency.
</em><br />
&nbsp;V.: May principles of Cybernetics be incompatible with laws of Physics or
<br />
vice versa ? I would not like to think this is an unsolvable &quot;conflict&quot;
<br />
between those two domains of science. On the other hand I would doubt that
<br />
physics alone is capable or has all means to explain what is system,
<br />
complexity, information, communication, life...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does it look like ? Design features of a communication system are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result of interaction between the constraints and demands of the job
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;required (Hauser, M.D., 1996. The evolution of communication). Probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differentiation of parts according to their functioning scales is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;right answer. So we have several large elements performing some specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;functions, and much larger amounts of smaller elements that do 'finer and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more precise functionality'. And it is likely that aranging systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;internals (elements, design features, communication system) according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Zipf's law is the optimal solution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SS: Well, how can that explain the power functions of earthquake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;magnitudes?
</em><br />
V.: They represent structural properties of Earth's crust. There are
<br />
different sorts of rocks, other large geological formations (systems again..
<br />
). So how that system breaks into parts should depend on and therefore
<br />
reflect its internal structure and different properties of composing
<br />
elements. I would think energy quantities released through disintegration of
<br />
any system is proportional to strength of links (between the elements)
<br />
broken. So energy released communicates out what was broken down there...
<br />
This should not look too weird if to remember &quot;popular methods of
<br />
communication&quot; among larger social groups - wars, riots, revolutions,
<br />
terrorism.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus my speculative (as always :) ) conclusion would be that zipf's law is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observed in systems trying to compensate entropy related energy or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information loss. If it is 'not a system' - it will not try to optimize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anything...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SS: Is a fault line a system?
</em><br />
&nbsp;V.: It is, at least a part of a larger geological system. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And it's elements will not follow the Zipf's law. The same as a dice or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coinwill not attempt to optimize themselves (and the random result they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produce) according to environmental conditions...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SS But, again, how will you tell by looking at ranked magnitudes only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether or not the population of data come from a system?
</em><br />
V.: By estimating how well it fits selected power (Zipf's) law. Of course
<br />
there are downsides and various concerns - for example how well observation
<br />
represent the real world (data quality). However we have statistical means
<br />
to estimate nearly any &quot;how well&quot;. By the way, Ramon Ferer in his article
<br />
gives a log-log plot with compared human language, artificial languages and
<br />
animal languages. There are noticeable differences among those different
<br />
systems...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With best regards
<br />
