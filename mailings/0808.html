Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This message responds to a number of posts (Heiner, John H., Pedro, 
<br />
Karl, Christophe) over the past several weeks.  In  most cases I 
<br />
include quotes from the author to help inform the readers of the 
<br />
original issue of correspondence.
<br />
<p>Heiner Benking post of Sun, 22 Sep 2002 09:55:26 +0200 (MET DST) 
<br />
proposes to bridge ...
<br />
&nbsp;the space between data and meaning by adding some work
<br />
done in the field of terminology research. This &quot;zooming&quot; into the space
<br />
between data and meaning is made clear at:
<br />
<a href="../../benking.de/Global-Change/Con-con.gif">http://benking.de/Global-Change/Con-con.gif</a>
<br />
more can be found at: CONCEPT AND CONTEXT MAPPING -  TKE 1996 Vienna
<br />
<a href="../../www.ceptualinstitute.com/genre/benking/term/terminology.htm">http://www.ceptualinstitute.com/genre/benking/term/terminology.htm</a>
<br />
and
<br />
<a href="../../benking.de/Global-Change/spatial-spacial.html">http://benking.de/Global-Change/spatial-spacial.html</a>
<br />
<p>I do not understand how this sort of global classification solves the 
<br />
problems of the information sciences.  Subjective classifications are 
<br />
difficult precisely because they require judgments that are 
<br />
controversial.  The usual approach to resolving such controversies is 
<br />
to count.  Perhaps Heiner would demonstrate how this &quot;zooming in&quot; 
<br />
process approaches Karls commentary on counting.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Karl wrote on Tue, 24 Sep 2002 13:00:57 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
&quot;My contention --jumping to a theoretical science level-- is that we 
<br />
have to let loose the conceptualizations transported by our way of 
<br />
counting (1,2,3,...) because they carry in an implicit way of 
<br />
thinking that does not agree with biological phenomena. The ideas 
<br />
behind a basic assumption about the world that are implicit in 
<br />
counting like 1,2,3,... seem to be:
<br />
<p>-- all elements are alike in their basic unit (there is only one kind of basic
<br />
units),
<br />
-- the distance between elements is the same,
<br />
-- the increase from one element to the next is the same (the basic element),
<br />
-- there is no end in sight to this series,
<br />
-- there are no preferred sizes to elements,
<br />
-- there are no two basic kinds of elements that cooperate in the 
<br />
generation of a new element.&quot;
<br />
<p>To what extend can Heiner's classification meet the criteria of Karl?
<br />
<p>Pedro wrote (within his doctrine of limitation, on  Fri, 27 Sep 2002 
<br />
14:46:01 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
<p>The neuronal information processing capabilities are built 
<br />
exclusively upon cellular building blocks that continuously 
<br />
instantiate their signaling abilities. The cellular use of electric 
<br />
fields becomes a prolongation of the transgenerational processing of 
<br />
genomes, both mapping into terribly different time scales, material 
<br />
substrates and 'topological' processes the overall fitness of the 
<br />
organism.
<br />
<p>Karl prefers to relate to the issues raised by Pedro by iterating his 
<br />
views on partitioning  [Wed, 9 Oct 2002 14:32:27 +0200 (MET DST)]:
<br />
<p>My hypothesis is that (his) { &quot;his&quot; refers to another reference, not 
<br />
Pedro} type of simple partitional exercise, reminding a random walk, 
<br />
may serve quite well for making sense of the interactions between the 
<br />
atomic components (how neutrons, protons and electrons may add up to 
<br />
compose the multi-dimensional atomic truth table).
<br />
<p>Perhaps, Karl, you would clarify your ideas by demonstrating such a 
<br />
truth table?  Biological organization generates exponential 
<br />
functions, not merely addition, does it not?
<br />
<p>In response to my question,
<br />
&lt;Does the concept of information depend on communication?
<br />
&nbsp;John Holgate  replies on Thu, 3 Oct 2002 09:42:36 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
That's the big question, isn't it?
<br />
What we really need is a solid theory of 'agency'  and mediated interaction.
<br />
(both Goranson and Fuchs come at agency from different angles in their papers).
<br />
<p>Coeira's 'Mediated Agent Interaction' might be of interest 
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../www.coiera.com/papers/AIME-01.pdf">http://www.coiera.com/papers/AIME-01.pdf</a>&gt;<a href="../../www.coiera.com/papers">http://www.coiera.com/papers</a> 
<br />
/AIME-01.pdf
<br />
It looks at the contextual constraint of 'common ground' .
<br />
John:  Thank you for the reference.  This paper is well worth the 
<br />
time. The author clearly distinguishes between the concept of 
<br />
transmission and mere translation.   This distinction deserves wider 
<br />
attention, especially in relation to the meaning of information. 
<br />
Shannon information is &quot;freely&quot; translatable among different computer 
<br />
systems (no deep conceptual problems, but lots of practical technical 
<br />
problems.)
<br />
<p>Pedro follows the doctrine of limitations, recognizing the cost of 
<br />
partitioning Fri, 4 Oct 2002 15:13:32 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
<p>&quot;The biggest cost is related to the painful process of 'decomposing' 
<br />
the big global problem into very small ones addressed towards a 
<br />
population of thousands of 'limited' specialized scientists and 
<br />
engineers.&quot;
<br />
<p>In mathematics, a general formula for partitioning has been available 
<br />
for several decades.  I have never seen this formula for partitioning 
<br />
cited by a biologist or a physician.  Is this because the fundamental 
<br />
problem of communication is not merely  dividing the whole into the 
<br />
sum of its parts?
<br />
<p>Pedro continues:
<br />
Finally, the discussions we are having on a non-mechanistic 
<br />
conceptualization of info, may have some intriguing connection with 
<br />
that very social-cognitive problem --How sciences working as a 
<br />
collective nervous system may throw 'anticipatory light' to overcome 
<br />
the impending menaces upon our planetary survival? In other words, we 
<br />
need to develop 'the art of socially playing with the Rubik cube of 
<br />
knowledge'. Our knowledge system has devoted countless 
<br />
scientific-philosophical energies to discussions on reductionism and 
<br />
the like, an almost nothing to 'integrationism', 'perspectivism', 
<br />
'limitation', etc. A mature info perspective (or science) could help, 
<br />
and should help,  to readdress the cognitive imbalance.
<br />
<p>The metaphor of &quot;the Rubik cube of knowledge&quot; is delightful!
<br />
<p>On a deeper level, Pedro brings to mind the extensive work of Herbert 
<br />
Simon, The Sciences of the Artificial, etc.  Simon introduces the 
<br />
concept of &quot;satisfactory and sufficient&quot; in place of optimization. 
<br />
The long history of &quot;optimization&quot; in engineering and mathematical 
<br />
theory suggest that the term will bring substantial confusion if used 
<br />
with respect to the dynamics of the CNS.
<br />
<p>In response to my question:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you provide an example of an MGS that produces meaningless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Christophe responds  on Wed, 9 Oct 2002 22:58:03 +0200 (MET DST):
<br />
It is the purpose of a MGS to produce a meaningful information
<br />
that will allow action implementation for the satisfaction of the
<br />
constraint S of the MGS. So it is not in the function of a MGS to
<br />
produce meaningless information.
<br />
It is to be noted also that action implementation can take place
<br />
only in locations where the constraint S exists.
<br />
We can call these locations &quot;Domain of Efficiency S&quot;. So a
<br />
meaningful (S) information can be efficient (S) or not, depending
<br />
if it is located in the Domain of Efficiency S or not.
<br />
In brief, a MGS produces only meaningful information, but these
<br />
meanings can be efficient or not. (if you want to know more on
<br />
this, see  I.3 in  <a href="../../www.theory-meaning.fr.st/default.htm">http://www.theory-meaning.fr.st/</a>).
<br />
<p>The cultural difference between engineering and biology emerges in 
<br />
this response.   In the &quot;Sciences of the Artificial&quot;, human ingenuity 
<br />
construct systems that are then put into motion.  Biological systems 
<br />
simply run on internal sources of motion; the constraints are the 
<br />
organism itself.  Ultimately, the &quot;information&quot; suffices for either 
<br />
life or death.  Should the notion of &quot;constraints&quot; be viewed as a 
<br />
physical metaphor for biology and medicine?
<br />
<p>In response to my question:
<br />
<p>&quot;Karl:  Is chemical and biochemical counting sufficiently complex to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;address your concerns about the nature of counting in FIS?  Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correspondence with chemical counting a necessity for biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counting?&quot;
</em><br />
<p>Karl responds (Wed, 9 Oct 2002 14:32:27 +0200 (MET DST))
<br />
In my opinion, the entries in the periodic table of elements by 
<br />
Mendeleiev can well be regarded as entries into a multi-dimensional 
<br />
truth table. Now, which kind is the truth question to which these 
<br />
answers yield always .t. (true)?
<br />
<p>We presently have reason to assume that there exist about 104 
<br />
distinguishable kinds of logical .t. values, which are to be splitted 
<br />
up into some several hundred varieties, as each entry may have from 1 
<br />
up to some dozen of equivalent forms (what the physicists call 
<br />
&quot;isotopes&quot;). The roughly 100 main archetypes of logical truths are 
<br />
subject to a manifold of logical relations. (there are some that 
<br />
cannot be present both at the same time--but it is another separate 
<br />
discussion).
<br />
<p>The entries into the above truth table have an intrinsic ordering 
<br />
principle which does not adhere strictly to their &quot;weight&quot;. This 
<br />
would be like saying that some subsets are similar to each other 
<br />
irrespective of their cardinality. Also, their building grammar 
<br />
appears to start at integer values of n=2i**2, with i = 1,2,3,... One 
<br />
may want to look into the generating function:
<br />
<p>Function m(n); local integer tmp, first, len, zero, m; tmp = int(sqrt(n/2));
<br />
first = 2*tmp**2; len = 4*tmp + 2; zero = if(n-first &lt; len/2, first + tmp,
<br />
first + len/2 + tmp); m = n - zero; return(m).
<br />
which gives one a &quot;long&quot; periodicity starting off at values of n=2i**2, with
<br />
half-periodicities included.
<br />
<p>Truth tables can be constructed for logical propositions and for 
<br />
first order logic and for higher order logics.  I do not understand 
<br />
the reason for focusing on the concept of logical truth table in this 
<br />
context.  Chemistry and biology are experimental sciences; only 
<br />
limited abstraction is possible.  How does one relate the truth table 
<br />
values of chemical propositions to communication?  The experimental 
<br />
observations of chemical compounds are constructions from the 
<br />
elements, *not* partitioning of the elements.
<br />
<p>Karl, while I agree that generating functions are critical to 
<br />
mathematics, how does one move from the mathematical concept of a 
<br />
generating function to communication? Do you intend that the &quot;psuedo 
<br />
- code&quot; you include in your message should be given meaning in terms 
<br />
of chemical structures, such a neural transmitters?
<br />
<p>The following paragraphs:
<br />
In drawing-of-samples it helps to add to the Gauss distribution the 
<br />
Euler distribution which is hugely asymmetric. In my opinion, the 
<br />
Euler distribution is far more important than the Gauss one. With it, 
<br />
one finds a
<br />
extremely useful connection between &quot;size-of-set&quot;, &quot;number-of-chunks&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;size-of-chunk&quot;. (And of course also the other two ways around, 
<br />
too.) The Euler distribution is very simple and elegant, although 
<br />
shamefully neglected. Just chart the number of partitions into k 
<br />
summands for each n (1 graph per each number, k horizontally, f 
<br />
vertically) and then integrate with n -&gt; inf.
<br />
<p>Then, to speculate on whether there is a material 'constant' of which 
<br />
these logical chemical archetypes are built up (the second question 
<br />
we are trying to answer), one needs to generate the .2. set of 
<br />
partitions. Those for which sum(m(ni))=m(n). On these, one may start 
<br />
adding pairwise: those that fall down where .3. holds true, these 
<br />
converge. One does not know whether the left or the right 
<br />
half-periodicity is the right one and they differ ever so slightly. 
<br />
My hypothesis is that his type of simple partitional exercise, 
<br />
reminding a random walk, may serve quite well for making sense of the 
<br />
interactions between the atomic components (how neutrons, protons and 
<br />
electrons may add up to compose the multi-dimensional atomic truth 
<br />
table).
<br />
<p>are not understandable to me.  The system under discussion, the 
<br />
domain of discourse is not stated as it relates to communication.  I 
<br />
suspect that the basic presupposition is that communication is merely 
<br />
a statistical abstraction.  How does one read the notation:  .2.  and 
<br />
.3. with respect to conjunctions and disjunctions of propositions or 
<br />
first order statements? Is the discourse related to marketing 
<br />
consumer products?  Biochemically, biological communication 
<br />
demonstrates both specificity and sensitivity.  The issues of 
<br />
Gaussian vs Eulerian distributions seldom arises.
<br />
<p>This post is rather long.  Individual respondents may hope to find 
<br />
some relationships among my ordering of the responses.
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
