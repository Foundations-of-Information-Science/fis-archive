<p>
Billions of humans, during the last eight millennia on Earth - very 
<br />
few indeed - have built the huge homosphere which is considered, de 
<br />
facto, the civilized environment that today is considered 
<br />
indispensable for the manifestation of human life.
<br />
<p>Along the last twentieth century multifarious combinations of human 
<br />
thoughts that were complemented by practical human work produced, 
<br />
great scientific advances which soon were efficiently employed for 
<br />
the accelerated development of the physical technology (*) that 
<br />
engendered what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution. The 
<br />
enormous potentiality of human features became once again undeniably 
<br />
evident due to the creation of unbelievable new things and processes 
<br />
that have been disorderly inserted in the biosphere, whose features 
<br />
have made possible the presence of humans on the unique Earth.
<br />
<p>This revolution, since the moment it was recognized as such, has been 
<br />
increasing - more and even more - the mass production of different 
<br />
kinds of goods, leading their trade to become the main engine of the 
<br />
economic life of communities and nations.
<br />
<p>It has been a revolution that has motivated decision-makers to 
<br />
commercialize the industrial transformation of all kinds of raw 
<br />
materials into different kinds of goods for being sold extensively 
<br />
and exhaustively to people who have been compulsively invited to 
<br />
consume faster and faster everything they manage to buy.
<br />
<p>The evolvement of this revolution has caused de facto the 
<br />
irresistible growth of consumerism as if it were THE indispensable 
<br />
desideratum of individuals, communities and societies, which must 
<br />
organize their respective survival in order to progress having 
<br />
continuously in mind what else must still be bought. A fact that was 
<br />
well forecasted by Thorstein Veblen as the conspicuous consumption, 
<br />
which has become the tool for making people to believe in the 
<br />
possibility of following a feasible road in order to reach the status 
<br />
of the leisure class.
<br />
<p>It was a revolution that arose and gradually advanced due to new 
<br />
possibilities offered by the increasingly modernized physical 
<br />
technology (*) that has become the main concern of civilized (highly 
<br />
educated) people: well educated humans willing to be members of the 
<br />
high society. It has evolved through many kinds of unconscious 
<br />
feedback and feedforward interactions established between decision 
<br />
makers, researchers, educators and consumers who - almost always - 
<br />
suddenly become increasingly fascinated by the perspective of being 
<br />
encouraged to enjoy living in a cybernetic leisure society.
<br />
<p>(*) computers, automation, atomic energy, faster transportation, 
<br />
communication and management of data,... in a large measure through 
<br />
the clever manipulation of causal relations which have been encircled 
<br />
in the invented concepts recognized by the words: INFORMATION, 
<br />
SYSTEM, SOCIOCYBERNETICS
