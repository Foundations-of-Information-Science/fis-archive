                <p>
                    Dear all,
                    <br />
                    Information as &quot;reduction of uncertainty&quot;, applies according to some
                    <br />
                    absolute point of view. How can it be transposed in a more pragmatic
                    <br />
                    view if we consider, at a first stage, information according to a
                    <br />
                    subjective domain or within a specific point of view, or if we consider
                    <br />
                    that any theory can always potentially constantly evolve, can reach
                    <br />
                    higher and higher levels of accuracy or fields of application, can be
                    <br />
                    extended or replaced or abandoned, etc...I am trying to handle some of
                    <br />
                    these aspects in this first quick following formulation:
                    <br />
                <p>As practical examples to keep in mind, let us consider the process of
                    <br />
                    solving any type of problem (from elaborating a scientific theory or an
                    <br />
                    experimental hypothesis to simple practical problems, or e.g. when
                    <br />
                    trying to solve a detective novel).
                    <br />
                    Let S1 be the set of &quot;informations&quot; at hand and let us suppose that S1
                    <br />
                    leads to a coherent universe/hypothesis H1 by means of relationships
                    <br />
                    between the elements of S1 (comprising subjective/relative aspects). Let
                    <br />
                    us call R1 this set of relationships. H1 can then be considered as the
                    <br />
                    couple (S1,R1) (i.e. a graph).
                    <br />
                    The relationships (elements of R1) between the elements of S1 may
                    <br />
                    comprise any type of subjective aspects at varying levels, inductive and
                    <br />
                    deductive inferences, statistical considerations, etc...and may come
                    <br />
                    from any discipline (mathematics,
                    <br />
                    physics,sociology,history,philosophy,etc....)
                    <br />
                <p>An information is not an isolated entity, it is an element within a set.
                    <br />
                    We can consider it merely as the couple (information, universe to which
                    <br />
                    it belongs). And it modifies this set and the related
                    <br />
                    universe/hypothesis as it is added to the initial set e.g.:
                    <br />
                    If a new information favorable to H1 (say INFi) is added to S1 it
                    <br />
                    reduces the &quot;uncertainty&quot; of H1.
                    <br />
                    If the new information (say INFn) is in contradiction whith the yet
                    <br />
                    elaborated hypothesis H1, this hypothesis has to be reconsidered totally
                    <br />
                    or partially; INFn has increased the &quot;subjective uncertainty&quot; of H1 and
                    <br />
                    has decreased the uncertainty of some other hypothesis H2.
                    <br />
                    The process is recursive leading to larger and larger sets that we can
                    <br />
                    call &quot;recursive informational sets&quot;.
                    <br />
                    In S1, before adding INFn, H2 has some type of existence, even some
                    <br />
                    &quot;potential&quot; existence of whatever probability, or even, it cannot be
                    <br />
                    deduced from S1 before INFn (total novelty, new concepts,...)
                    <br />
                    An information of type INFn may occur only after multiple occurrences of
                    <br />
                    informations of type INFi, which may practically results in a low
                    <br />
                    &quot;subjective&quot; uncertainty of universe/hypothesis of type H1 (persistence
                    <br />
                    of wrong interpretations). (note that, in practical cases, we should
                    <br />
                    also consider different possible levels of contradiction between H1 and
                    <br />
                    H2 -totally or more or less partially)
                    <br />
                <p>Let S1i = S1 + INFi ; S1n = S1 + INFn; S1in = S1i + INFn; S1ni = S1n +
                    <br />
                    INFi.
                    <br />
                    (the sign &quot;+&quot; is used here to add an element to a set).
                    <br />
                    The information depends on the universe to which it is related: in the
                    <br />
                    above example, a favorable information INFi for H1 is not the same
                    <br />
                    wether it is included in the set before or after the information INFn
                    <br />
                    (unfavorable to H1) (S1 and S1n are related to different relative
                    <br />
                    universes; INFi decreases uncertainty of H1 in S1 and not in S1n).
                    <br />
                    But ounce INFi and INFn are both included in the set, wether in S1in or
                    <br />
                    in S1ni (according to the order) these resulting two sets seem to define
                    <br />
                    the same related universe (cumulative aspect of information).
                    <br />
                <p>Is the set momentaneously ordered? How to consider this dynamic aspect?
                    <br />
                    Role of the relative/absolute points of view? It seems that any
                    <br />
                    observation brings always &quot;something&quot; (an information according to some
                    <br />
                    point of view) , but keeps always intrinsically &quot;something else&quot;. We can
                    <br />
                    only get endlessly successive approaches when the set grows and the
                    <br />
                    related universes change. At a given level, we build at best a coherent
                    <br />
                    system according to some point of view and its interpretations.
                    <br />
                    Recursively.
                    <br />
                <p>Very sincerely,
                    <br />
