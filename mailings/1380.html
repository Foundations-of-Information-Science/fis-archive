Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>First of all, cordial greetings to more than one dozen new colleagues who 
<br />
have joined the fis list during this week, so to participate in the coming 
<br />
session on ENTROPY &amp; INFORMATION, to start next 5 April, chaired by Michel 
<br />
Petitjean (Editor-in-Chief of the Journal 'Entropy'). Apart from Michel's 
<br />
introductory text we will accept other longish contributions to the theme: 
<br />
during next week we will inform on how those files will be handled. (In 
<br />
general, participants are expected to post a maximum of two regular 
<br />
messages per week, and attachments are not recommended). After the session, 
<br />
a special issue in the Journal Entropy is envisaged.
<br />
<p>---------------------------------
<br />
<p>We are currently in the aftermath of a previous session on 'Autopoiesis and 
<br />
Meaning' ---interested parties can have a glance at the fis web site:
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/fisspecials/index.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/fisspecials/index.html</a>
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/default.htm">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/</a>
<br />
<p>Curiously, the discussion on meaning has been related several times with 
<br />
music (e.g., see weeks ago Luis Serra, and more recently Stan and me). 
<br />
Along the non-exclusively linguistic approach to meaning I have argued, 
<br />
perhaps the most crucial rhythmicities impinging on our personal 
<br />
elaborations of meaning ---particularly on how we navigate amidst our 
<br />
perceptual memories from 'salience' to 'relevance'--- seem to relate to 
<br />
protein synthesis. Meaning is not only a 'protean' concept: it is also 
<br />
'proteic'. In the long term, and in a non-trivial way, the 'music of the 
<br />
spheres' like all other motor-perceptual occurrences is felt and 
<br />
internalized as a result of orchestrated waves of protein synthesis taking 
<br />
part in neuronal bodies and in the synapses themselves... the intense waves 
<br />
(rounds) of creation/destruction in the synapses may be related to the 
<br />
general theme of 'information erasure' as Stan pointed out, and to 
<br />
'entropy' considerations. Perhaps it is another minor aspect to explore in 
<br />
the next session.
<br />
<p>About the argument by Ted on groups, it looks connected with the above. 
<br />
Group theory, and particularly Michael Leyton's approach, builds up very 
<br />
elegantly regarding organizational dynamics at high perceptual levels (once 
<br />
neuronal topological specializations are available), and probably for the 
<br />
formal analysis of ontogenetic patterned development (in multicellulars) I 
<br />
think. But it looks almost a blind alley intracellularly, to make sense on 
<br />
the myriad of networking molecular occurrences of the cell, which are based 
<br />
on an endless casuistic of molecular recognition events. And in which the 
<br />
bizarre structure of the genetic code and the unassailable problem of 
<br />
'protein folding' act as an uncrossable border for formalistic approaches. 
<br />
At the next level, 'grupoids' as argued by Ian Stewart, look a valuable 
<br />
addition to protein networking dynamics... and yes, at levels further out, 
<br />
it seems that one can fruitfully apply group theory &amp; symmetry extension 
<br />
tools. But all of this 'bioinformational stuff' deserves a far more focused 
<br />
discussion. Hopefully, the new colleagues arrived to the session on Entropy 
<br />
and Information will also be interested in having a future discussion 
<br />
session on biological information.
<br />
<p>Let me conclude this miscellany with comments extracted from Alain Berthoz 
<br />
(2000, Harvard Un. Press) 'The Brain's sense of Movement', mentioned in my 
<br />
last messages. His reflections on our perceptual problems in the pervasive 
<br />
urban milieu: 'we delight in movement perception-prediction... in their 
<br />
giant Lego constructions, modern architects have forgotten our pleasure of 
<br />
movement, the Golden forms of nature...', and in page 256:
<br />
<p>&quot;But, oh, right angle, you are neither in a wave on the ocean nor in the 
<br />
wind, nor in the knowing coincidence of a sigh and a smile; you are neither 
<br />
in the petal nor in the leaf. You express the triumph of the most ordinary, 
<br />
lazy, petty geometric mindset over the sense the of finesse, which might 
<br />
save me from despair.&quot;
<br />
<p>Remembering Raymond Queneau: do we also need some &quot;science poètique&quot;?
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS: particular thanks to Michel, and to Shu-Kun and Gyuri, for their 
<br />
cooperation regarding the next session.
