Dear John and Gente,
<br />
not pleased with my any kind of ignorance, I will try to update it. :-)
<br />
<p>Let me try to pick up your interesting comments:
<br />
<p>you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have become
</em><br />
increasingly reluctant to talk of information. Partly this is because I
<br />
do not know what is at stake. It seems to me reasonable that two
<br />
people could interpret the same information differently. Given this,
<br />
it seems to me reasonable that information does not depend on
<br />
the specific interpretation. &lt;
<br />
<p>Thats what I call communication: an information as something that makes a
<br />
difference to the observer, independetly on what is thouhgt (interpreted).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems to make it very difficult
</em><br />
for two people to share information, especially to transmit it, since
<br />
presumably what is new to the recipient is not new to the transmitter.
<br />
Other misalignments of novelty are also quite possible.&lt;
<br />
<p>Ok. But arent it that misalingments the font of creativity?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So a lot hangs on the wants. And that
</em><br />
is where I am not quite clear about what is at stake.&lt;
<br />
<p>Maybe there is a confusion between what informtion &quot;does&quot; in consciousness
<br />
and what in communcation. This are two diffeent levels.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Especially, I am have become quite
</em><br />
intolerant of arguments to the effect that since information depends
<br />
on the receiver information capacity depends on the receiver's
<br />
desires, prejudices, beliefs, whims, intelligence or stupidity. There
<br />
may be information there to be found but the receiver is just to
<br />
dense to notice it. We need a way to talk about that sort of
<br />
circumstance that is both systematic and integrated into a
<br />
general theory of information.&lt;
<br />
<p>Ther is no emitter, and there is therefore no receiver of information. They
<br />
are autopoietic systems, which process information on their own. While doing
<br />
so, they °communicate°, that means they produce noise necessary for
<br />
information to arise.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that there is a lot to be said for integrating the notion of
</em><br />
information capacity with information, as Gyuri and Norbert
<br />
seem to be suggesting. There is a great deal of unifying power.&lt;
<br />
When searching for a unified theory, as the vienna group does, this power is
<br />
unmeasurable. Thanks to them.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we define information in intentional terms, does that mean
</em><br />
that information theory is hopelessly circular as an approach
<br />
to understanding intentionality and meaning?&lt;
<br />
<p>If we do so, the circle does not open, I agree.
<br />
But if we come to a shareable concept of communication, we will look at a
<br />
circuit, where intentions, expectations and meaning get its sense. (view my
<br />
posted paper)
<br />
<p><p>Greetings
<br />
<p>Gottfried
