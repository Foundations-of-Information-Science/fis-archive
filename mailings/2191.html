                <p>
                    Dear Jerry,
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your remarks are almost always hard to respond in a proper manner. A
                    <br />
                    principal reason for this rests upon me, and not upon you. I have been
                    <br />
                    constantly referring to situated logic, instead of propositional logic.
                    <br />
                    Classical sciences are a kingdom of propositional logic, especially
                    <br />
                    classical one, while quantum sciences also have some affinity toward a
                    <br />
                    particular type of propositional logic known as quantum logic. In contrast,
                    <br />
                    situated logic comes to the fore once the relationship between the context
                    <br />
                    and the contextual elements is simultaneously focused upon. Identification
                    <br />
                    of the context requires the act of measurement, and situated logic is
                    <br />
                    conditioned on the act of measurement. If propositional logic is the only
                    <br />
                    rule of the game in town, most of what I have said may remain irrelevant.
                    <br />
                    Instead, if there happens to be a case for conditional statements to
                    <br />
                    survive, situated logic may have some room for its own survival.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either good or bad, the distinction between types and tokens is not crisp
                    <br />
                    in situated logic, depending upon how the context for both could be
                    <br />
                    conceived of in the first place. A most defensive strategy here must be to
                    <br />
                    make differences in tokens ubiquitous, as dismissing a sturdy problem of how
                    <br />
                    different types could emerge, as much as possible. For instance, energy of
                    <br />
                    the first law of thermodynamics is a name assigned to something which
                    <br />
                    preserves its quantity while being subject to its transformation in quality.
                    <br />
                    Consequently, a new difference arising from energy transformation is a
                    <br />
                    &quot;non-definitional variable&quot;, asking a new nametag only after the event.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, occurrence of a Planck's quantum is very peculiar in that
                    <br />
                    both the context (the particle-like nature) and the contextual elements (the
                    <br />
                    wave-like nature) appear simultaneously as bare empirical phenomena, instead
                    <br />
                    of as logic. It may correspond to appearance of a new type in the sense that
                    <br />
                    it remains robust even in presence of adverse disturbances. It would not be
                    <br />
                    required to assign a new nametag for distinction every time de novo
                    <br />
                    disturbances are imposed. One unique aspect with a Planck's quantum is its
                    <br />
                    coherence linearly superposed.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As following along almost the similar line, one may expect to have a
                    <br />
                    nonlinear quantum coherence as pointing to appearance of a further new type
                    <br />
                    if it remains robust. This will be a matter of totally empirical or
                    <br />
                    experimental issue as much as appearance of a Planck's quantum has been so.
                    <br />
                    Once the robustness is empirically guaranteed, one may wish to apply to it
                    <br />
                    propositional logic, situated logic or whatever else depending upon the
                    <br />
                    situation.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citric acid cycle which we thought as an example showing an operation
                    <br />
                    of a quantum as a heat engine exhibiting a nonlinear coherence is
                    <br />
                    exclusively empirical and experimental (Matsuno, K &amp; Nemoto, A. 2005,

                    <br />
                    is informational here is to come up with something surprising from the
                    <br />
                    participatory perspective.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have touched upon some of your concern only cursorily.
                    <br />
