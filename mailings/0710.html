<p>
Edwina,
<br />
<p>Yes I agree we should 'revenir a nos moutons' in this forum.
<br />
<p>Personally I have never found the 'subject/object' distinction (or man/woman binarism)
<br />
philosophically fruitful.
<br />
<p>Your post does raise the important issue of misinformation/disinformation and
<br />
whether information and truth are natural allies.
<br />
<p>Hopefully in the next session of this conference we can mutually explore 'misconceptions' a little more than we have so far. 
<br />
<p>If opinions are low-grade beliefs and knowledge is justified true belief then opinions and knowledge are not binary opposites but part of a continuum of belief ranging from 'subjective'
<br />
fanatacism and evangelism to 'objective' scientific truth. The opinions of Giordano Bruno were considered illogical and evangelical in their time. Later they became acceptable beliefs
<br />
and components of a body of knowledge. Given other circumstances even Charles Peirce 
<br />
(or Germaine Greer) might have been burnt at the stake for heresy.
<br />
<p>The truth of a belief is not in its logicality but in its justification.
<br />
<p>That pregnant unwed mothers should be decapitated is quite a logical belief for the Nigerian government but it is not an (ethically) justified belief.
<br />
<p>What role does 'information' play in all this? Is it, if it exists at all, a kind of ubiquitous 
<br />
crap-detector or a cognitive mist we have to pass through to get to the truth?
<br />
<p>Luciano Floridi's paper addresses the question from a hardcore logic perspective
<br />
with his 'alethic' approach but the jury is still out.
<br />
<p>In my view misinformation is a distortion of true belief rather than an absence of information altogether. 
<br />
<p>Your opinion?
<br />
<p>John H

Subject: opinions vs knowledge
<br />
<p><p>Again, I ask why are evangelistic opinions posted to this discussion
<br />
site? The reply to my rejection of the evangelistic post about women
<br />
having innate 'love' capacities while men do not and therefore, they
<br />
can 'save the world' was yet another post filled with illogical
<br />
opinions, this time from Thommandel (don't know his/her real name).
<br />
<p>I don't think that readers want a sentence by sentence deconstruction
<br />
of that reply, but I could show how each sentence is based on nothing
<br />
more than subjective opinion. Each collection of sentences, when
<br />
framed in any kind of logical form,  leads to an invalid 'conclusion'.
<br />
The reply has nothing to do with knowledge or information. These are
<br />
nothing more than subjective non-empirical and illogical opinions,
<br />
filled with pure speculation, with moving from 'some' to 'all', with
<br />
lots of 'perhaps' suggestions suddenly moving to 'always'; with false
<br />
innuendoes,  with insertion of emotive fallacies - ad hominem, ad
<br />
populam,...and....false data, false links, sentences following each
<br />
other without any valid logical or empirical relation.
<br />
<p>Again - what does this type of post have to do with the scientific,
<br />
rational examination of information? I could use these posts for
<br />
students to take apart in my critical thinking and logic classes -
<br />
but - what are they doing on this list?
