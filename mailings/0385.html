I would like to support Edwina on this very well thought formulations that are very much in accordance with Peirce's philosophy and semiotics. the question of physio-semiotics has been coming up again and again lately on conferences I have participated in. The semiotician and philosopher of science John Deeley is one of several promoters of such a view. There are some important, profound and complicated problems worth discussing here. The first issue of CHK next year will bring a very important article by Winfried Nöth on how Peirce view part of this problem.

In reply to Pedro's post of today, and the suggestion that we limit
<br />
our examination of information processes by considering the living
<br />
cell as 'the zero system' to start the analysis, my perspective of
<br />
information processes actually seeks to include physics.  I include
<br />
physical processes within information and consider it a grave error to
<br />
set up physical processes as closed  'Laws' rather than evolving
<br />
Rules. That is, to set up an analysis of reality as operating within a
<br />
dyadic frame that has physical processes as inviolate Laws on one
<br />
side, and evolutionary processes on the other side, is to me, an
<br />
error. Are physical processes immune to evolution? Do they exist 'per
<br />
se', by themselves, or do they work within the biological to 'evolve'
<br />
in a type of secondary form? Do we really know? My concern is that if
<br />
we view physics as essentially formal, because its actions add nothing
<br />
to the processes of biology, then, I think we may mislead ourselves. I
<br />
don't think that physics is purely formal, ie, Lawful.
<br />
<p>As Pedro says, we may have to revise the central tenets of physics and
<br />
we can't do this by beginning only with the living cell. That, in a
<br />
sense, continues the 'imperialism of physics' of which Pedro speaks,
<br />
for we, by ignoring its nature, accept that nature as as an area
<br />
closed to further research. However, in physics itself, researchers
<br />
are finding that the processes which were previously thought of as
<br />
inviolate Laws are not that fixed.  I am most certainly not proposing
<br />
that we define the processes of physics as 'biological', just as we
<br />
don't define the processes of biology as 'physical'. However, physical
<br />
processes are a vital component of the biological; they provide its
<br />
capacity for expansion (within the processes of quantum mechanics) as
<br />
well as its capacity for closure (within the processes of classical
<br />
mechanics) and we should explore these physical processes and see how
<br />
the biological and the social realms have transformed these 'Laws'
<br />
into 'Rules' which can be entangled to develop more complex
<br />
interactional capacities.
