Universal expansion in the Big Bang is accelerating.  As pointed out by 
<br />
Layzer, and also Frautschi, the acceleration has been so fast that the 
<br />
Universe has not been able to equilibrate internally.  The result was 
<br />
progressively: decoherence -&gt; strong forces -&gt; gravitation -&gt; 
<br />
organization. That is to say, here acceleration is the parent of 
<br />
gravitation.  In &quot;equal and opposite&quot; spirit, the Second Law was 
<br />
simultaneously instituted in the drive of the Universe to equilibrate 
<br />
(we can surmise that the Universe is an isolated system because 
<br />
otherwise it could not expand in accelerated fashion, and, of course, we 
<br />
know that al energy gradients are labile).  The strength of the Second 
<br />
Law should therefore be scaled to the force of gravitation.  So, in the 
<br />
notion that the area of the surface of a region is proportional to its 
<br />
entropy, in the Universal nonequilibrium case, that entropy would have 
<br />
to be the maximum possible entropy, not the actually achieved amount.  
<br />
If that is so, then the distortion of spacetime now is not what it would 
<br />
be calculated to be at equilibrium.  In any case, I would say that the 
<br />
Second Law implies the existence of gravitation, while this implies the 
<br />
existence of Universal acceleration.
<br />
<p>Not fantasy, just thinking in a top-down mode as opposed to the more 
<br />
classical bottom-up of physics. My chosen field of study for the last 
<br />
fifteen years (almost four books now) has been toward understanding the 
<br />
large-scale structure of space-time; gravity, expansion, order, in 
<br />
Boltzmann like fashion meaning in purely probabilistic and equilibrium 
<br />
terms. This is my last post to this group.
<br />
<p>In regards to gravity and expansion relationship, Alan Guth explains:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(according to particle physics) ...at very high energies there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should exist peculiar kinds of substances which actually turn
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity on its head and produce repulsive gravitational forces. The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inflationary explanation is the idea that the early universe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contains at least a patch of this peculiar substance. It turns out
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that all you need is a patch; it can actually be more than a billion
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times smaller than a proton. But once such a patch exists, its own
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravitational repulsion causes it to grow, rapidly becoming large
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to encompass the entire observed universe.
<br />
<p><p>Guth's terms are made as a post description of events. Looking back, 
<br />
Guth is implying that gravity is turned around and made repulsive at the 
<br />
very outset of time when it would actually be more accurate and more 
<br />
disciplined to not refer to an initial repulsive force as gravity, and 
<br />
state that initially as time begins there is only a repulsive force 
<br />
behind inflationary expansion, which later folds back, becoming an 
<br />
attractive force. Generally it is far more accurate to refer to gravity 
<br />
as a portion of expansion that is turned inward, or as I like to put it, 
<br />
folded backward toward the past.
<br />
<p>In that the universe originates and is presumed to exist in a highly 
<br />
ordered state, the second law considers the issue of what other states 
<br />
are possible. The conclusion Boltzmann led us to is that there is a 
<br />
greater measure of disordered states pulling time in that direction. The 
<br />
greater body of disordered possibilities could be said then to be 
<br />
located in the direction of the future, with all those states more 
<br />
ordered located in the past. However, there are significant improvements 
<br />
possible over Boltzmann's method of categorizing states as either 
<br />
ordered or disordered.
<br />
<p>As a small example of expanding upon Boltzmann's general ideology, we 
<br />
consider the influence of all the states which are more ordered than the 
<br />
present state of the universe? There is of course a vast group of states 
<br />
between our present state and the extreme of order at or near the 
<br />
beginning of time. We apply the second law to the atomic world and 
<br />
consider it as an explanation of why entropy increases, but what about 
<br />
applying the influence of such groups to the large-scale structure of 
<br />
space-time. Suppose we consider the influence of ordered states? What 
<br />
phenomenon seems to pull the universe backward toward past-like 
<br />
conditions. The answer of course is gravity.
<br />
<p>So could (quantum) gravity be a product of all the possible states more 
<br />
ordered than our present state? In Boltzmann terms, gravity clearly 
<br />
opposes disorder. Intuitively speaking, gravity tries to recreate and to 
<br />
some degree successfully maintains the past. If gravity is a product of 
<br />
ordered states, what else can be said of this approach. Of course in 
<br />
opposition to gravity, the universe expands. Expansion compliments 
<br />
disorder, at least it appears so in the intermediary stages of cosmic 
<br />
evolution. It certainly compliments entropy. If extended this approach 
<br />
would suggest that cosmological expansion is a product of a greater 
<br />
number of states in which the universe is more expanded than its present 
<br />
state.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Acceleration is the parent of gravitation.
</em><br />
<p>Suppose we consider the state of the universe as time begins. All states 
<br />
are more disordered, more expanded, than the original state, thus all 
<br />
probability would be for time to move in that direction. Only after the 
<br />
system moves away from the extreme of order would the group of states 
<br />
which are more ordered than the present state of the system increase in 
<br />
measure. We could describe this as a portion of the probability for 
<br />
expansion turning backward toward the past, therein causing gravitation.
<br />
<p>Hopefully this is an intriguing idea, without departing from Boltzmann, 
<br />
but if one improves upon how Boltzmann modeled all possible states, 
<br />
rather than simply considering ordered and disordered states, we find 
<br />
other ways to sort apart the set of all possible states in respect to 
<br />
the present state of the universe. A quantum cosmology is all 
<br />
probabilities, and so if the universe seems like it should be in a 
<br />
greater stage of equilibrium then there is something wrong with how we 
<br />
are modeling all possible states.
<br />
<p>The most obvious method of grouping states is in respect to density or 
<br />
the average density of a state. Obviously, if there are so many more 
<br />
states of greater disorder than the state we are in, it would seem there 
<br />
are also more possible states in which the average density of the 
<br />
universe is less than its present state. However, in grouping states in 
<br />
reference to average density there are some unexpected consequences, 
<br />
because our gradient is more evidently bounded, by an extreme of low 
<br />
density.
<br />
<p>There has never been any mainstream consensus (if any discussion at all) 
<br />
that I am aware of toward recognizing if boundaries exist in Boltzmann's 
<br />
model in the direction of disorder. Cosmologically speaking and so 
<br />
concerned with the set of all possible states, it is said that the 
<br />
second law is responsible for the arrow of time, but there isn't serious 
<br />
debate on whether or not there is a limit to the measure of disordered 
<br />
states? Is there a single extreme state of disorder? In regards to 
<br />
cosmological evolution, we presently model order and disorder as a giant 
<br />
wedge shape of possibilities. There are ever fewer states of order at 
<br />
each point of greater density as we move backward in time toward greater 
<br />
order. Inversely the precise measure of disordered states at any 
<br />
specific average density is greater at any such point in the future. In 
<br />
other words, there were fewer possible patterns available at higher 
<br />
densities than lower densities.
<br />
<p>The problem with the consistency of this claim surfaces when we 
<br />
recognize that a gradient of states in reference to density is bounded 
<br />
by the extreme of absolute zero. Without question, the universe is 
<br />
moving toward zero. The temperature and matter density of the universe 
<br />
has been decreasing since time began and accelerating expansion only 
<br />
accelerates that trend. Accelerating expansion shows the direction of 
<br />
time to be distinctly moving toward zero, and not simply toward 
<br />
conditions short of zero. The direction of time toward zero is perhaps 
<br />
the most fundamental characteristic of the universe. The problem which 
<br />
arises in acknowledging that there is an extreme state of absolute zero 
<br />
density in the direction of a future of decreasing density, is that 
<br />
there must also then be a boundary limit for the measure of disordered 
<br />
states in that same direction. And thus, as the universe evolves from 
<br />
past to future, the measure of states which are more ordered than the 
<br />
present state increases, while the measure of states which are more 
<br />
disordered decreases.
<br />
<p>Please try to appreciate fully what I have just said, because the 
<br />
consequences are very dramatic to the Boltzmann method of understanding 
<br />
why entropy increases. As the universe evolves, if the measure of 
<br />
past-like states are on the increase and the measure of disordered 
<br />
states are on the decrease, then in reference to large-scale cosmic 
<br />
evolution, a system will eventually reach an equilibrium balanced 
<br />
between order and disorder. If we merely acknowledge the extreme of 
<br />
absolute zero as a boundary which is completely unavoidable, and 
<br />
maintain Boltzmann's approach of explaining entropy, then it cannot be 
<br />
said that there are always more disordered states than ordered states. 
<br />
In fact according to Boltzmann's methods a system at zero should 
<br />
probabilistically move toward order or grouping. With all the 
<br />
ingredients considered the cosmological arrow of time has to be toward 
<br />
an ultimate point of balance between order and disorder, according to 
<br />
Boltzmann. Prior to the discovery of accelerating expansion, that dictum 
<br />
was entirely within the realm of possibility. It was still possible 
<br />
prior to 1998 that we would discover the universe would expand endlessly 
<br />
at an ever decreasing rate toward a temperature short of absolute zero. 
<br />
That temperature would mark the cosmic balance point between order and 
<br />
disorder. Except that scenario is not what we discovered. We discovered 
<br />
that the direction of time is precisely aligned with zero. Time is on a 
<br />
crash course with absolute zero either in finite or infinite time. The 
<br />
only two scenarios realistically possible are the big rip and the big 
<br />
freeze or chill aligned directly at zero, and in either of these 
<br />
scenarios time converges in state space to the single state of zero.
<br />
<p>So either we throw out Boltzmann's probabilistic method entirely, or we 
<br />
recognize that absolute zero is the true balance point toward which 
<br />
cosmic evolution is attracted. Could absolute zero be the ultimate 
<br />
balance state in nature? If so it would obviously be a balance between 
<br />
positive and negative, not order and disorder.
<br />
<p>I don't know if others would agree but it is my contention that the most 
<br />
stable example of perfect (ugly) symmetry is absolute zero. I also 
<br />
contend that absolute zero is a physical state, a perfectly flat and 
<br />
empty Euclidean space, in respect to the measurable properties of 
<br />
space-time. I realize that Einstein stated there is no such thing as 
<br />
empty space, and I understand why he made that statement, but the 
<br />
expansion of the universe is now accelerating and we can't simply ignore 
<br />
the fact there is at least the potential for the universe to reach 
<br />
absolute zero, with expansion literally stretching all matter and energy 
<br />
perfectly flat. Zero is a possible state. All matter and energy would be 
<br />
converted to spatial expansion, and time would end in a state of hyper 
<br />
expansion, although such properties, including the extension space at 
<br />
zero being infinite, are definable only from our present position in 
<br />
time. I believe even that absolute zero is the native state of the 
<br />
Universe, not the state from which time begins, but rather the ultimate 
<br />
state in which there is no time or change.
<br />
<p>Finally there is one more issue, the structure of the adjacent possible 
<br />
at right angles to the gradient from bang to zero. There is also a 
<br />
smooth pattern, a smooth and uniform state like the smoothness of 
<br />
absolute zero existing at every average density of the universe from the 
<br />
extreme density of the big bang all the way to zero. Everyone knows 
<br />
this. Why the universe did not remain smooth after the big bang has long 
<br />
been a question in cosmology. But there is another state not ever 
<br />
focused upon, even less acknowledged than absolute zero, which is the 
<br />
physical extreme of lumpiness that inevitably exists opposite of the 
<br />
smooth extreme. In fact the set of all possible states is bounded in all 
<br />
directions by extremes. Image below or click here 
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../everythingforever.com/statespacemodel.gif">http://everythingforever.com/statespacemodel.gif</a>&gt;.
<br />
<p><p><p>The universe can be considered to be in a particular state. There is an 
<br />
average measure of cosmological density, as in, there are so many atoms 
<br />
per square meter. The present state of the universe rests within the 
<br />
spectrum of all possible states shown below, and is influenced by the 
<br />
greater measure of possibilities, but not only along the axis of average 
<br />
density, but also between two adjacent extremes to that axis, smooth and 
<br />
lumpy extremes. Suppose we freeze the universe from expanding or 
<br />
collapsing, removing the influence of set A and B. What are the possible 
<br />
directions of freedom remaining for a universe frozen at some specific 
<br />
point in its expansion or average density?
<br />
<p><p><p>Considering the entire range of possibility, stars and galaxies could 
<br />
break up and atoms could spread evenly throughout existing space, so 
<br />
grouping could disintegrate and spread out uniformly. Even the mass of 
<br />
particles could disintegrate to be evenly distributed in space. 
<br />
Eventually you have perfect smoothness and thus high symmetry. In 
<br />
contrast, in the opposite direction of change, galaxies could lump 
<br />
together to form super galaxies, which could also group, and then 
<br />
finally there is the most radical extreme of a single mass within a 
<br />
space-time bubble (a geometrically flat universe is still a bubble of 
<br />
space-time, bounded spatially by the first moment of the big bang. 
<br />
Relativistically the bubble expands internally with each observer acting 
<br />
as a centerpiece. The space surrounding the milky way galaxy, our local 
<br />
group, is the oldest area of the universe, and the outer edges of 
<br />
space-time are literally where at this moment the big bang is still 
<br />
occurring. So, with the contours of this bubble as our frame of 
<br />
reference, all galaxies, all matter in particle form, could conceivably 
<br />
exist in the very center of the space-time bubble surrounded by an 
<br />
evolved expanded cold space region which is followed by the contour of 
<br />
temporal decline back to the early universe).
<br />
<p>To portray this single mass accurately in reference to grouping and 
<br />
symmetry order, the extreme of lumpiness would be all protons collapsed 
<br />
into a uniform whole particle with an equal number of electrons also 
<br />
grouped into a super electron that exists in an orbital around the giant 
<br />
purely positive nucleus. So essentially we have something similar to a 
<br />
giant hydrogen atom as a universe, which seems complete fantasy imagined 
<br />
as a real physical system, but only because it is so different than the 
<br />
universe we observe. It is different because probabilistically, both the 
<br />
lumpy and smooth extremes are highly improbable. On either side of a 
<br />
cosmological system there is a group of states pulling equally toward 
<br />
opposite extremes (image below or click here 
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../everythingforever.com/adjacentgroups.gif">http://everythingforever.com/adjacentgroups.gif</a>&gt;). Movement by a system 
<br />
in one direction increases the measure of possible states in the 
<br />
opposite direction, which is why the universe did not remain smooth 
<br />
after the big bang. Remaining smooth would have been like winning the 
<br />
lottery every second. Note that the adjacent possible is influential in 
<br />
short time durations, while the overall set of states pictured above is 
<br />
influential in the deep time of cosmological evolution.
<br />
<p><p><p>The approach of modeling all possible states in reference to extremes 
<br />
also provides a probabilistic explanation for electromagnetism, the 
<br />
strong and weak force. Forces are seen to be divided between past and 
<br />
future. The most interesting element is the concept of convergence. If 
<br />
time is moving directly toward a single state, absolute zero, then that 
<br />
state will dictate events in its own past. If some event is inevitable 
<br />
in your future, other events have to organize themselves enough to make 
<br />
the later event happen. If it is inevitable that you will be at the top 
<br />
of the Eiffel tower in a week, but nothing else is pre-determined, then 
<br />
what is possible in the week prior to the tower remains open to a wide 
<br />
range of possibilities, but that range is extremely restricted from the 
<br />
broader range of possibilities by the future event. Electromagnetism, 
<br />
the force of balance, is a force from the future. It is the flat perfect 
<br />
uniformity of absolute zero shaping its own past. The weak force must 
<br />
eventually break up all complex particles into protons and electrons so 
<br />
that electromagnetism can spread all atomic material evenly as the 
<br />
universe nears the Einstein-Bose condensate final stages before a 
<br />
complete cosmic equilibrium ensues.
<br />
<p>Hopefully I have included enough here to suggest a probabilistic 
<br />
relationship between gravity, expansion, entropy, electromagnetism. 
<br />
Everything described is actually just an extension of Boltzmann's 
<br />
general approach to thermodynamics. The cosmology is presented in 
<br />
greater detail at my website and more so again in my forthcoming book.
