<p>
Dear Guy and colleagues,
<br />
Thanks for your welcome comments. Metaphysics, if I understand the word, 
<br />
refers to that branch of philosophy which attempts to understand the 
<br />
fundamental nature of all reality, whether sensible or insensible. I 
<br />
believe disciples of metaphysics fall somewhere in between materialists, 
<br />
or naturalists, who accept only tangible, visible objects, and 
<br />
idealists, who maintain that there is nothing but ideas, or mind, or 
<br />
spirit. It sounds like you’re advocating the naturalist view, Guy. I 
<br />
suppose, though, that even materialists don’t usually reject the 
<br />
existence of metaphysics itself.
<br />
I think the ideas discussed in metaphysics are among the most profound 
<br />
and interesting in the history of human discourse. And that history goes 
<br />
back at least as far as Aristotle, and also includes, surely, Plato, 
<br />
Kant and Descartes. I don’t think you and I could possibly do justice to 
<br />
the seminal, wonderful dialectic framed by those renowned thinkers 
<br />
without a great deal of rereading and consideration. These are certainly 
<br />
not ideas that have been ignored by our forbears.
<br />
Still, I do believe, as I’ve argued, Guy, that there is, in fact, a 
<br />
convergence between thermodynamics and information theory. And that, 
<br />
indeed, all information is a property of physical objects; including all 
<br />
the information in our brains. But, this does not, I’m convinced, imply 
<br />
that everything which exists is observable. It doesn’t necessarily 
<br />
exclude the existence of an intangible mind or soul, for example, or of 
<br />
God, or of insensible mathematics. And I wouldn’t label such things 
<br />
“metaphysical information”.
<br />
No doubt, when I’m considering a mathematical theorem, there is 
<br />
specialized brain activity facilitating my understanding. I suspect that 
<br />
the philosophers might say that this activity is not, itself, the 
<br />
mathematics. I think Michel made the important point that we all seem to 
<br />
have no problem distinguishing a thermodynamic system, say, from our 
<br />
mathematical model of it. We may process our perceptions and 
<br />
understanding of the system through brain activity, I suppose, but those 
<br />
brain responses are not, themselves, the thermodynamic system. And, 
<br />
likewise, the neurological function associated with mathematical 
<br />
reasoning, is not, itself, mathematics. (I feel very inadequate making 
<br />
this argument; I know that the philosophers have offered innumerable, 
<br />
superior explanations.)
<br />
But, I am now convinced that the conclusion of the materialists cannot 
<br />
follow logically just from the fact that information is a property of a 
<br />
physical, perceptible object. Even though the observable nature of 
<br />
information may have led to many carefully crafted, assiduously 
<br />
researched and annotated, thoughtful arguments. I suspect, without 
<br />
having done the research, that there is, by now, a hefty accumulation of 
<br />
contemporary publications assessing Landauer’s dogma of material 
<br />
information upon the metaphysical discussion.
<br />
All these ideas interest me thoroughly, but I can’t say I’m able to 
<br />
discuss them from a perspective of knowledge of the seminal discourse 
<br />
provided for us by eminent philosophers. Still, I think it’s a mistake 
<br />
to assert that “if metaphysics exists, then information theory can only 
<br />
be a toy model of entropy, at best”. I suspect you mean that if anything 
<br />
exists which is not observable, then my support for Landauer’s 
<br />
conclusion that all information is physical, must be invalid. That’s the 
<br />
implication I find incorrect, Guy, and I understand that to be the point 
<br />
of our disagreement.
<br />
Thanks for your stimulating reply.
<br />
Cordially,
<br />
Michael Devereux
