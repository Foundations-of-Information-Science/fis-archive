</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what happens when some of our background assumptions are wrong?
</em><br />
<p>There is an idea in computational learning theory called 'agnostic learning'
<br />
(Haussler, 1992). Even if you know that all your theories are wrong, you can
<br />
still find one that works best. For example, there is probably no invisible
<br />
hand making sure that the relationship between education and economic growth
<br />
is linear, but we can nevertheless find which linear function best describes
<br />
the relationship. Instead of placing trust into the language we use to
<br />
express theories, we place the trust into the *utility* of the theories. By
<br />
&quot;language&quot; I mean the common ground, a part of the paradigm: the formal
<br />
space of all possible theories; a point in this space is a theory. Such a
<br />
perspective needs fewer break-downs as the language continues to develop:
<br />
for every problem there are two possibilities: find the best approximation
<br />
or develop a new language.
<br />
<p>There is a particular division in every community: there are the people that
<br />
try to do better with the existing language, and there are rebel boat
<br />
rocking people who are proposing new languages. For example, the information
<br />
science community is proposing a new language with 'information' inside it,
<br />
for example.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In normal science, Kuhn pointed out that scientists tend not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to question the background theory so long as it keeps solving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; puzzles.  But what happens when normal science ceases to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solves puzzles?  What happens when science is in crisis?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to Kuhn this leads to a breakdown in communication.
</em><br />
<p>True. At that point the community splays apart in search of the new
<br />
language. But due to the nature of this, the communication is difficult due
<br />
to the abundance of mutually incomprehensible dialects. Eventually, one of
<br />
them will be better then others (or at least better funded), and others will
<br />
abandon and join in. Alternatively, there will be a chain reaction of
<br />
consiliences between the dialects with the hope of a new standard paradigm
<br />
emerging.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Following this line of thought, the discovery of new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consiliences (and the preservation of old ones) is the key to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developing new common ground that leads to more powerful and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accurate decision making.  More powerful and accurate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication does not refer to the increasing the number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bits of information (the channel capacity).  This by itself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot lead to more successful decision making.  It has to do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the quality of information, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not its quantity.   That's why something along the lines of Dretske's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantic notion of information married with the concept of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consilience might be the right way to go.
</em><br />
<p>I always view &quot;information&quot; as conditional to some paradigm. Namely, the
<br />
information of a certain phenomenon depends on whether I view the process as
<br />
linear or as non-linear. The linear view implies a simpler model with less
<br />
information (more noise, more Shannon entropy), and the non-linear view
<br />
implies a complex model with more information (less noise, less Shannon
<br />
entropy). There is an interesting trade-off here, if one considers the
<br />
information of the model: a complex model requires more information to
<br />
specify than a simple model. The idea of Rissanen's minimum description
<br />
length is to combine these two pieces of information: the information needed
<br />
to specify the model and the information needed to explain the data with the
<br />
model.
<br />
<p>Some people think that some particular paradigm is intrinsically true. In a
<br />
true paradigm, the information would correspond to physical information. I
<br />
cannot deny that they are right, but I can see various kinds of problems
<br />
(breakdowns, revolutions) that can arise by putting too much faith into a
<br />
particular paradigm. On the other hand, a more relaxed perspective of truth
<br />
has the negative side effect of a Babel-like lack of common ground, and the
<br />
ensuing problems in achieving synergy and collaboration.
