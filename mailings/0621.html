Dear Cristophe and colleagues,
<br />
<p>Sorry but I could not answer your really interesting message 29/5/02 --it
<br />
was too hot the fis weather. Now, more quietly, here there are some points
<br />
about your comments. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your theme &quot;entering the observer&quot; addresses several interesting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;items, among them the horizon of observers and the risk of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reductionism that the observer introduces in info sciences. Let me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;try to join these two points vs the degree of complexity addressed. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with you that the horizon of observers is wide: from cells 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to firms, including  insects (swarm intelligence) and humans. And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perhaps the spectrum could be widened even more with your other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theme &quot;molecular recognition&quot; (assuming we can consider 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecule as an observer. Would you ?).
</em><br />
<p>-- There should be some minimal conditions for 'observers', in my opinion.
<br />
At least, they should be able to 'categorize' the received info and have ad
<br />
hoc knowledge and internal representations, conducing to effective action
<br />
(of adaptive nature). Their material stuff has to be very especial to allow
<br />
these capabilities (for instance, a living cell, with an intact genome and
<br />
protein sysnthesis-degradation looks capable, also a brain, or a firm...).
<br />
Conversely, an isolated molecule has only 'conformations', is not adaptive,
<br />
has no representations, etc. This rules even for the most complex enzymes
<br />
or proteins, or for a piece of DNA. Once they have been extracted from the
<br />
organization of the living cell, they leave the realm of the informational
<br />
and enter into the '3 mechanics' provinces: classical, statistical,
<br />
quantum, and associated disciplines.  
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, regarding the risk of reductionist approaches to info entering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the game, I also agree with you about the reality of that risk, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;especially when pointing at the notion of meaning. But with so wide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an horizon of covered items, I feel the risk can be managed. And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one can estimate that there is place for several different models of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers, so avoiding being taxed of reductionism. The question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will then be about the coverages of the proposed models and about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the completeness of used hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For cells or insects, I believe we can look at them as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;living machines&quot; and find some ways to modelize them as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers with little risk of reductionism.
</em><br />
<p>-- I agree with you except in the closing sentence (for me, 'living
<br />
machines' is but an oxymoron: in my paper there is a strong rebuttal of a
<br />
famous similar quotation, by Shannon, echoed by Gell-Mann). The problem
<br />
with reductionism is not that it is a priori wrong (quite much good science
<br />
is reductionist) but that it lacks an appropiate balance in the form of
<br />
'integrative' or 'integrationist' science. Unfortunately, making good
<br />
integrative science is far more difficult than its counterpart, if only
<br />
because of its multidisciplinary demands. The problems to advance such type
<br />
of science become really worsened when an official ideology declares the
<br />
absence of such integration problem, the exclusivity of the downwards
<br />
causation, and the futility of any balancing efforts. Information is then
<br />
automatically lost. (At least, in the sense I deffend, as communication
<br />
intertwined within an 'evanescent permanence', that can only be appreciated
<br />
looking at the 'whole' dance of structural elements). In simpler biological
<br />
terms it is the dismissal of synthetical physiology for the sake of
<br />
molecular biology analytical tools. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When we reach the level humans (sorry for the gap...), then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comes for sure a risk of reductionism: modelization of human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as observer is not possible today. I mean  globally. Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ignorance about the nature of human brings us to  address 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only limited and very partial possible models. This because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do not understand the nature of reflected consciousness, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emotions, of free will, and so. Philosophy, neurosciences, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;psychology, cognisciences and others are still turning around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these subjects, looking for a way in. The &quot;hard problem&quot;...
</em><br />
<p>-- I absolutely agree.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But coming back to the level of insects, a simple modelization can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do it. Like the one proposed for a  &quot;meaning generator system&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Information and Meaning. FIS 2002). For instance, pheromone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;smell can be looked at as a signal creating a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information in an ant. The meaningful information being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;pheromone smell has some positive link with vital constraints to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be satisfied, so trail is to be followed&quot;.  
</em><br />
<p>-- Your paper is quite intriguing, and I believe it points out a fertile
<br />
direction ofpragmatic  bioinfo modelling. My ad hoc suggestion: why you do
<br />
not try to apply it to the 'two component system' that controls cellular
<br />
motility and many other functions in prokaryots? Besides, if you have a
<br />
glance into my cellular scheme (FIS2002) you may find a few further
<br />
categories to consider in relation to the contents of your model (in
<br />
Lahoz-Beltra FIS 2002 too). Perhaps the future discussion of these two
<br />
papers together in the same batch would be interesting.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, observer/meaning at the level of human or firms address
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;degrees of complexity that have little to do with insects. Other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models are needed, à priori. But it is interesting (and risky
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reductionism wise) to investigate a possible usage of previous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;model by transfering the complexity increase to the constraints
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the meaning generator system. More precisely, by trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imagine how some new constraints to be satisfied came up during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the course of evolution. This approach is to be looked as an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis to be validated (not validated as of today). 
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;-- Your use of the 'constraints' is wise. I was using the term
<br />
'principles' for such theoretical constructs that are directly related to a
<br />
functional optimization (your 'to stay alive' is for me 'keep your fitness
<br />
intact'). These principles are enigmatic entities, bridging different
<br />
functional levels, and endowed with a profund asymmetry (remember Ted's
<br />
posting). How do they work?, and how do they interrelate? Well, it depends
<br />
on the direction we look at them. The progressive addition of constraints
<br />
upon living cells is a necessary condition for the emergence of further
<br />
complexity, for they unify and simplify organismic functions... but I have
<br />
no idea on how this can be expressed formally (beyond trite systems of
<br />
equations). It is a fundamental question of the biological 'integration'
<br />
problem. Maybe we could find inspiration in the engineering design of
<br />
complex systems (Kauffman's Boolean views seem interesting, but really?).  
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And there may come in also some form of the Schumpeter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;creative destruction&quot; you propose to introduce. A constraint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be satisfied only at the expense of a new (cheaper) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraint, coming in as more acceptable for the system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(group survival vs individual survival, pleasure/reality and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Freudian repressions, ...). 
</em><br />
<p>-- I believe you are right about that. Although I was introducing
<br />
Schumpeter &quot;creative destruction&quot; as a case example of the structural
<br />
flexibility (and continuous self-production/self degradation) in which all
<br />
natural observers are immersed--otherwise there is no informational
<br />
properties emerging. As you imply, new constraints and principles, to be
<br />
added, have to be adaptive, somehow contributing to a competitive advantage
<br />
(fitness, behavioral efficiency, economic benefit) and so to perform the
<br />
funtions cheaper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Many are the Foundations of Information Science...
</em><br />
<p>Indeed! This modest e-conf., in spite of all its problems and limitations,
<br />
is converging upon several 'islands' of relevance for future work of the
<br />
natural, computer and social scientists involved in this Foundations
<br />
enterprise: info &amp; physics, partitions vs symmetry, molecular recognition,
<br />
bioinformation ('computational') principles, abstract underpinning of firms
<br />
and social info... The philosophical and semiotic interpretations are a
<br />
good company for science, no doubt about that, but very rarely do
<br />
contribute to advance it.  
<br />
<p>best greetings to all
