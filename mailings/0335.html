International Conference on Systems Thinking Globally Concerned
<br />
<p>UNITY through DIVERSITY
<br />
<p>November 1-4, 2001, in Vienna
<br />
<p>University of Vienna and Vienna University of Technology
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
<p>in the Böckl-Saal (first floor)
<br />
of the University of Technology of Vienna (in the old building)
<br />
Technische Universität Wien
<br />
located  in Karlsplatz 13 (*), A-1040 Vienna (AUSTRIA)
<br />
<p><p>Ludwig von Bertalanffy, the founder of the General Systems Theory, was born
<br />
100 years ago. This is a perfect occasion and his native city of Vienna is
<br />
the proper place to review those of his ideas which have left their traces
<br />
on current systems thinking. It is in the interest of the whole scientific
<br />
community to evaluate the impact the humanistic ideals - which Bertalanffy
<br />
formulated for the era of globalisation - have had on the development of
<br />
science.
<br />
<p>FORUM for presentation of papers, lectures, speeches, posters and also an
<br />
Open Space for self-organized debates and discussions.
<br />
<p>(*) Karlsplatz 13 is located in one of the borders of Ressel Park. It can
<br />
be accessed through underground (U-bahn U4, and also U2 and U1), Station
<br />
Karl Platz, Exit Ressel Park. It is the old building of Vienna University
<br />
of Technology (Technische Universität Wien) in front of the end of this
<br />
exit (300 meters). You just cross the Park.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>You may copy the following  14 lines, fill it with the information required
<br />
and send as a message

<p><p><p><p>SYMPOSIA on some of BERTALANFFY'S MAIN CONCERNS
<br />
<p><p>Symposium (I). &quot;The creation of a sustainable society depends on Innovative
<br />
Systems Thinking (IST) supported by General Systems Weltanschauung (GSW)&quot;
<br />
aims at exploring how it might be feasible to reach Sustainable Development
<br />
as a steady state or flow equilibrium of humankind's dynamics.
<br />
<p>...to move forward makes necessary to study the socio-cybernetic processes
<br />
which drive the system or to seek to outline the developments that are
<br />
required to introduce a more effective socio-cybernetic system. The
<br />
question is: how are we to identify and map these systemic forces and how
<br />
are we to design a more effective socio cybernetic system. (John Raven)
<br />
<p>GSW, as a methodological tool, helps to identify reliable views about the
<br />
world situation, needed for creating feasible ways to reach Sustainable
<br />
Development as a steady state or flow equilibrium of humankind's dynamics.
<br />
This steady state is today in danger of being abruptly broken because the
<br />
Homosphere which comtinues growing is causing faster and faster not only
<br />
the destruction of fragile areas of the Biosphere but also the crack of
<br />
essential elements of the  Ecosphere (elohimjl)
<br />
<p><p><p>Symposium (II) &quot;Wholism (or Holism) The way forward into the 21st century&quot;
<br />
aims at searching further how human beings may and also should learn to
<br />
develop their way of thinking for clearly seeing the forest before they may
<br />
start dealing with one or another tree; and also for grasping the meaning
<br />
of a tree before trying to handle one of the leaves or a flower or a fruit.
<br />
<p>(W)Holism transcends both the metaphysical approach of the Middle Ages and
<br />
the scientific method, which has shown that the successful conquest and
<br />
transformation of natural resources carried out by masses of people
<br />
employed as human resources generates huge and quite undesirable effects
<br />
that make its assumed positive contributions more and more questionable
<br />
<p>At present, humankind faces  global problems reaching a crisis point. The
<br />
main reason for this is that  prevailing decision-making processes
<br />
completely ignore the need for respecting a wholeness required to
<br />
counteract the devastating consequences of 'scientific' fragmentation.
<br />
<p><p><p>Symposium (III) &quot;General Systems Theory as a Methodological Maxim&quot; aims at
<br />
pondering why and how GST could and should prescribe better foresight
<br />
rather than hindsight; be used for crisis prevention in preference to
<br />
crisis management: may widen the scope of inquiry for asking first whether
<br />
a certain project, policy or action is justified,...
<br />
<p>GST emerged (as) &quot;an exact doctrine of wholeness as a &quot;pure nature science&quot;
<br />
or &quot;reine naturwissenschaft,&quot; ...a  hypothetical-deductive system of
<br />
principles which followed from the definition of the wholeness of an
<br />
organismic (open) system,...  &quot;the ultimate generalization of the
<br />
organismic conception&quot; that started in  Organismic Biology , was followed
<br />
by an Organismic-systems Psychology continued with organismic insights in
<br />
societal systems and culminated assuming possible an organismic model of
<br />
society and considering necessary a GST discipline or science about
<br />
&quot;principles common to the several levels of organization&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p>Symposium (IV) &quot;New Image of Man and Woman&quot; supported by a new General
<br />
Anthropology&quot; aims at searching reliable ways for building the
<br />
interdisciplinary enterprise (comprising human biology, psychology,
<br />
psychiatry, sociology, linguistics, economics, the arts,...) that may help
<br />
to create societal circumstances needed for allowing the individual
<br />
emergence during the life of every person learning on his/her own to
<br />
consciously develop his/her peculiar personality, while his/her intrinsic
<br />
spontaneity was confronted to diverse cultural, economic and social
<br />
conditions determined peculiarly by the performance of those humans that
<br />
constitute every human society,...
<br />
<p>...humanity faces a clear danger of being dehumanized, even destroyed, by
<br />
debasing self-images, created through mass persuasion by means of
<br />
behavioral engineering (conceived by Watson and developed by Skinner, who
<br />
were inspired by the Pavlov's conditioned reflexes in rats). Behaviorism
<br />
lead towards totalitarianism (either a benevolent one, as in Huxley's Brave
<br />
New World, or a malevolent one, as in Orwell's 1984) that aims at
<br />
increasing the control of people.
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy aware of this danger consider necessary to find out a &quot;new
<br />
science of man&quot; or general anthropology &quot;The image of man is not only a
<br />
theoretical question,... it is a question of the preservation of man as
<br />
human&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p>Symposium (V) &quot;Development of Perspectivism, as a Systems Epistemology&quot;
<br />
aims at making explicitly how the validity of knowledge depends on the
<br />
PERSPECTIVE from which that knowledge is perceived and  also at making
<br />
clearer how the disciplinary and mutidisciplinary validity of the
<br />
Bertalanffian Perspectivism is a way of getting closer and closer, though
<br />
diversely, to the 'absolute truth' of every aspect of the whole reality.
<br />
Obviously all the perspectives, as views explicitly expressed of a certain
<br />
aspect of the reality, are valid. At the same time none of them is more
<br />
authentic than the other.
<br />
<p>The Bertalanffy's perspectivism oblige every learned person, while
<br />
learning, to be aware of his/her relative ignorance,  to recognize that
<br />
using his/her brain to the utmost he/she must increasingly try to be aware
<br />
of the limits of his/her (human) powers of cognition, because &quot;perception
<br />
is not a reflection of 'real things' [but rather] is an interaction between
<br />
knower and known&quot;. The result of every observation is partly the result of
<br />
the viewpoint and methodology of the observer
<br />
<p><p><p>Symposium (VI) &quot;Business based on Bertalanffy's Weltanschauung&quot; aims at
<br />
searching how to build the optional circumstances that are needed for the
<br />
emergence of a new ENTREPRENEURSHIP SPIRIT, as required for leading
<br />
business to be oriented by the &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; suggested by Bertalanffy,
<br />
as the  global awareness that may generate the ecological, ethological &amp;
<br />
ethical values needed:
<br />
<p>1)	for taking care of the proper preservation of GAIA's features;
<br />
<p>2)	 for maintaining the BIODIVERSITY that may help humans to learn how
<br />
to increase the survival chances of our species;
<br />
<p>3) 	for making feasible to interpret humanely and implement cogently a
<br />
Terrestrial Bill of HUMAN RIGHTS and COMMITMENTS.
<br />
<p>Managers and decision makers must recognize today, before it might be too
<br />
late, that humankind must not be disassembled by means of successful (?)
<br />
competitive firms between wealthy entrepreneurs and well paid workers and
<br />
employees on one side, and unemployed people and poor and miserable
<br />
customers who become desperate beings trying to learn, whatever the means,
<br />
how to survive the next day.
<br />
<p><p><p>Symposium (VII) &quot;Peace Research through General Systems Theory
<br />
(Weltanschaung)&quot; aims at exploring how General Systems Theory might be used
<br />
as an approach to the prevention of wars - military, economic, political
<br />
and cultural ones.
<br />
<p>The General Systems Theory that Bertalanffy conceived and developed is an
<br />
approach for all fields and all kinds of problems,... a systems approach
<br />
for dealing with the disarray and disturbances caused by some
<br />
inconveniencies in the way a certain number of factors involved are
<br />
interacting among themselves and altogether -as an assumed entity or system
<br />
- with its environment.
<br />
<p>The GST approach to Vietnam, according to Bertalanffy would have included
<br />
the primary question of whether or not the U.S. should have made a military
<br />
commitment in Vietnam at all. Today this approach may encourage belligerant
<br />
entities to examine jointly why any  conflict could arise and to explore
<br />
together how to reduce and eliminate the causes of conflicts.
