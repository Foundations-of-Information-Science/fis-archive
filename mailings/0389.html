Edwinas view here is very interesting:
<br />
<p>&quot;To me, information is, again, the
<br />
result of relations. Matter/energy...in relation to other
<br />
matter/energy is not longer non-informed but IS informed, it is
<br />
information, it operates, in order to be in these relations, as
<br />
'information'. A mass of energy, when it is organized such that it has
<br />
a particular relation of its energy/mass...with one proton and one
<br />
electron, IS informed mass. Its informed nature permits it to enter
<br />
into specific relations with other informed mass - ie - more hydrogen
<br />
atoms...to become a molecule..or whatever. So, these relations, which
<br />
operate according to rules, are most certainly, in my view, actions of
<br />
information.&quot;
<br />
<p>It can be understood in many ways. she declares she is not a Platonic but an Aristotelian. From my other readings this is only partially true, I think, as she is also an evolutionary thinker. I cannot find out if she subscribes to Aristotl's concept of active reason  (nus poieticos) that is a common intellect for al human as it is the godlike reason behind nature too and if information is an actor in itself doing things with it self and with other things. I often perceive Edwina's information concept to be alive and with a rudimentary mind that then develops as information organize material structure to become cells and later nervous systems, but I am not sure. We have had this debate a couple of times, and to me it get a bit clearer every time.
<br />
<p>Again this type of clarification is essensial to find out what the point, advantages and shortcomings are in a paradigm of information as the one Edwina is developing. I would like FIS and it conferences to do that.

I guess the debate between the 'lowest limit' of the site for
<br />
information processing will continue to be debated and I don't see the
<br />
point of coming to a single conclusion, for I feel that it would be
<br />
not only impossible but counterproductive. Science is about
<br />
exploration not about consensus. So-  I disagree with a 'lowest limit'
<br />
that considers that information processes only take place within the
<br />
living organism. James Barham writes about the 'reification of
<br />
information' and I don't know what he means by this. A reificiation of
<br />
anything, to me, is the transformation of a dynamic process into a
<br />
closed symbolic process and I don't see how this relates to my theme
<br />
that information processing takes place within physical and chemical
<br />
processes as well as within biological and socioconceptual processes.
<br />
<p>I agree that we operate within both internal and external realities.
<br />
However, I do not agree that information exists 'as itself' . Never.
<br />
That's Platonic and I'm a die-hard Aristotelian. Information is
<br />
matter-in-relation-to-other matter. Such relations, of both habitual
<br />
and immediate type, can take place within all interactional processes
<br />
in this cosmos - the physical-chemical, the biological and the
<br />
socioconceptual. I therefore don't agree that information exists
<br />
&quot;only in conjunction with living matter&quot; (quote from Barham). I think
<br />
that the nature of 'what is information' and 'what is knowledge' has
<br />
to be very clearly defined by each researcher - and we probably will
<br />
not come to a unanimous conclusion. To me, information is, again, the
<br />
result of relations. Matter/energy...in relation to other
<br />
matter/energy is not longer non-informed but IS informed, it is
<br />
information, it operates, in order to be in these relations, as
<br />
'information'. A mass of energy, when it is organized such that it has
<br />
a particular relation of its energy/mass...with one proton and one
<br />
electron, IS informed mass. Its informed nature permits it to enter
<br />
into specific relations with other informed mass - ie - more hydrogen
<br />
atoms...to become a molecule..or whatever. So, these relations, which
<br />
operate according to rules, are most certainly, in my view, actions of
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>The biological realm operates within a more complex process of
<br />
relations - but again, the axioms are the same - ie, with the
<br />
necessity for these relations to operate according to codal rules, and
<br />
the result of the relations meaning a more complex formation of
<br />
mass/energy.
<br />
<p>I don't agree that in the abiotic or 'inanimate universe', that
<br />
'information is always relative to us as knowers&quot; (Barham quote).
<br />
Information is part of the abiotic formation of mass. As I said, an
<br />
atom has to organize itself in a particular relation of mass/energy,
<br />
in order to be that atom, to be that molecule. That's an informed
<br />
relation...and most certainly the molecule doesn't rely on us, as
<br />
agents-who-come-along- and -describe, in order to exist as that
<br />
organized/informed molecule.  Our description is irrelevant to its
<br />
reality.
