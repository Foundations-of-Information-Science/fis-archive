Dear Pedro and colleagues, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I take the liberty to fight this argument all the way since I wish it to
<br />
be correctly understood. I agree with much of what you say and I
<br />
appreciate the example of the enzyme regulating the flux efficiently.
<br />
However, I think that it is important not only to distinguish between
<br />
the flux of resources and the entropy that it generates, but also
<br />
between the thermodynamic and probabilistic entropy that is generated by
<br />
this flux. Thus, there would be three systems of reference (theories) in
<br />
the case of your example. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The distinction is important because we are interested in information
<br />
theory. Historically, authors from the side of physics and chemistry
<br />
have attempted to subsume probabilistic entropy under thermodynamic
<br />
entropy as a special case or a little fraction that can be fully
<br />
understood using (chemical) physics. The argument becomes then often
<br />
unclear because the authors do not specify the system of reference other
<br />
than as &quot;the&quot; system. With &quot;the&quot; system, of course, they mean &quot;nature&quot;.
<br />
(One can show that the probabilistic entropy is smaller than the
<br />
thermodynamic entropy times the Boltzmann-contant.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Information theory however provides us with an entropy calculus that is
<br />
first independent of the system of reference. Therefore we can also
<br />
study the probabilistic entropy in an economic system. Whenever
<br />
something is communicated a probabilistic entropy is generated by this
<br />
redistribution. For example, in this exchange of emails we can count the
<br />
threads, the mails, the words, etc., and compute in each dimension how
<br />
much (probabilistic) entropy is generated. This is straightforward and
<br />
it does not have anything to do with the thermodynamic entropy produced
<br />
by or the energy needed for all the systems which carry the exchange.
<br />
(One can compute a thermodynamic entropy of the exchange of message, but
<br />
that would not inform us at all about the exchange.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I am sure that you are able to elaborate this for your example of the
<br />
enzyme. The question one has to raise first when one studies the
<br />
probabilistic entropy of a system is: what does the system redistribute
<br />
when it communicates? This provides us with the specification of an
<br />
hypothesis. (George Spencer Brown would call this an observation = a
<br />
distinction + an identification, but that may be confusing.) Second, one
<br />
can ask how one can indicate the communication. This provides us with an
<br />
operationalization. Thirdly, the measurement can inform us about the
<br />
relative quality of the hypothesis. A system which operates in terms of
<br />
energy redistribution can then be considered as a special case that
<br />
requires a special theory (e.g., physics). But the one system cannot
<br />
reduced to the other without a specific theory (that can be tested!).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards and season's greetings,
<br />
&nbsp;

Subject: Re: [Fis] Again about coupling resources and information
<br />
<p><p>Dear Sergio and All,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the many ideas packaged in your message. Let me start with a
<br />
brief return to the disagreements.
<br />
<p>Am affraid that in my comments two weeks ago about your sentence, the
<br />
'hard-core reductionism' expression was rather inappropriate --too trite
<br />
and contentious. And maybe in your recent exegesis on my comments there
<br />
was inappropriate wording too, as I clearly separated in my text your
<br />
own sentence -- with quotations and italics-- from my own inferences
<br />
about it (as Alicia said in Wonderland: &quot;I do not mean that you mean
<br />
what I mean&quot;). Anyhow, enough of the trivial.
<br />
<p>Let me discuss again the the relative presence of absence (the 'weigh')
<br />
of the Second Law in the dynamics of living beings. It is for me a very
<br />
important subject, rather obscured even by illustrious authors of the
<br />
field of physics (and of thermodynamics: Shu-Kun has written some clear
<br />
sentences about that). Here, rather than arguing from sweeping
<br />
statements  --in favor or against--- I would like to enter a few
<br />
specific ideas from the scientific discipline in charge of the energetic
<br />
analysis of the living: bioenergetics. 
<br />
<p>Initially, most of living matter is composed by polymers of enormous
<br />
lenght, thermodynamically pretty unusual, for all of those reactions
<br />
imply an entropy decrease.  Who pays for that evident entropy decrease?
<br />
It is enthalpy, the other player in the Gibbs free energy of almost
<br />
every biological reaction--bigger, far bigger quantitatively, around one
<br />
order of magnitude, or even two in most reactions within the living. The
<br />
famous DNA polymer, for instance, repeating a eloquent saying by GR
<br />
Desiraju (2003) is but &quot; a manifestation of mutual recognition, a
<br />
storage device for structural information, and a victory of enthalpy
<br />
over entropy&quot;. 
<br />
<p>In enzymes, the influence of entropy in their overall efficiency is
<br />
extremely low --they fantastically decouple information and energy
<br />
processes, and they do so by becoming extremely good players with the
<br />
enthalpy processes (always evitating the conversion to heat). Up to the
<br />
point that, for instance, the whole cost of our brain processing
<br />
operations is in the order of 10 watts. Almost of all of the energy
<br />
transformations occur throughout the enthalpic path, scaping from the
<br />
thermalization inherent to the change of entropy --it is crucial working
<br />
always at room temperature, opposite of our engines, until now, for
<br />
socially what we try to do now with the 'fuel cells' is but an imitation
<br />
of biological metabolism.
<br />
<p>One of the consequences of the energy-information decoupling is the
<br />
almost arbitrary complexity of the circuits of the latter --in types,
<br />
forms, relative magnitude, connections, etc. By this extra informational
<br />
complexity, the biological type of extremely efficient use of
<br />
'resources' may escalate up to 99.999 % (e.g., in key mitoch.
<br />
respiratory chain reactions). This is only possible because there is the
<br />
previous enormous accumulation of information classes both in the
<br />
sequence of DNA and in the dynamic processes of the enzymic agents and
<br />
the numerous concentration gradients around. Without that information,
<br />
and without genes and ad hoc machinery, there is no detection of the
<br />
necessary resources, no efficient transportation and inner
<br />
transformation, no exchange of metabolic processing functions with other
<br />
cellular types, etc.
<br />
<p>Even more interesting is the theme of enzyme degradation. Actually, it
<br />
does not exist 'per se', rather it is a sophisticate mechanism of
<br />
chopping away  the unnecessary enzymes and proteins (idle ones, or
<br />
misfolded, or oxidized ones) and reconverting them to their original
<br />
amino acid constituents, isolated. Then, these amino acids are used
<br />
again and again to produce new proteins, i.e., other types better suited
<br />
to the immediate metabolic circumstances of the cell. Perhaps this is a
<br />
big lesson for our linear industrial system of products and wastes --and
<br />
that lesson could be prolonged up to the many strands of biological
<br />
wisdom that converge on GAIA. The planetary wisdom exists by means of a
<br />
myriad of co-adapted genomes &amp; intracellular &amp; intercelluar info
<br />
labyrinths.
<br />
<p>In my opinion, the information provided by science and technology for
<br />
our societies, is not far away from what is done in such a complex way
<br />
around the cellular genomes. Then, I think that Loet is quite right when
<br />
he concludes that &quot;there is no alternative to knowledge-based
<br />
innovations.&quot; So to speak, in our own societies Information and
<br />
Resources become equal partners too, indeed mutual pre-requisites of
<br />
each other: without knowledge and techniques we could not even talk
<br />
about such resources --would coal, or oil, or the nuclear be a
<br />
'resource' without the appropriate know-how? Irrespective of their
<br />
immediate environmental wealth, 'clever' societies have always found
<br />
resources --and will keep finding them quite probably, provided an
<br />
overall wisdom guides them. 
<br />
<p>Implicitly, I was recognizing that, for good or for bad, science is not
<br />
alone and does not cover the whole spectrum of human life and human
<br />
knowledge. It is a robust  but, in actuality, a very modest player that
<br />
far from been situated 'on top' is 'on tap' ... The many (and factually
<br />
incommensurable) dimensions of the social body: cultural, political,
<br />
moral, religious, nationalistic, racial, esthetic, hedonistic, etc.,
<br />
steer our global trajectory in very strange ways--irrational ones quite
<br />
often. And for us, scientists, it is quite difficult to convey our
<br />
messages beyond our narrow disciplinary bounds and to be heard. Actually
<br />
society listen to us as a cacophony of little voices.
<br />
<p>In this aspect I think we need the mutual tuning up, as much as
<br />
possible, of our disciplinary messages to society, and a continuous
<br />
adaptation of our paradigms to the changing intellectual circumstances
<br />
--as Enzo put. These days maybe I have exaggerated the critical part in
<br />
my comments on the second law (another poor expression, thanks Sergio,
<br />
was my &quot;putting the tool on the altar&quot;). But I might have a grain of
<br />
truth in my freshman vision of the current clash between neoclassic and
<br />
ecological econometrics. Ecological economics and information science
<br />
might have important  goals  in common, and somehow we should get along
<br />
concerning some particular discussions in the future, I think. (The
<br />
informational theory of value is for me sort of a 'pot of gold'
<br />
relatively close by).
<br />
<p>Well, given that we will close the session at the end of next Monday,
<br />
this is my final posting in the session. My personal thanks to all of
<br />
our ecological economics invitees who have contributed so informatively:
<br />
Sergio, Enzo, Pavel, Edgar, and particularly to our elegant chairs Jerry
<br />
and Luis. 
<br />
<p>best wishes--season greetings.
<br />
<p>Pedro
