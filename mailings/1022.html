Hi John,
<br />
Thanks for introducing Scott Muller's work. I am really interested in
<br />
peiople who have own, creative ideas and are industrious enough to pursue
<br />
them, regardless of general public opinion. Multidimensional partitions are
<br />
a slimy, unpleasant, yecchy affair, because they have so many forms and
<br />
varieties. (Some discussions in the last weeks about quantum physics and
<br />
multi-valued logic etc. might greatly benefit if the subject had been, would
<br />
be, earnestly addressed by logicians and mathematicians.)
<br />
So, I am pleased to help Scott in his travails. Please advise him that I
<br />
have counted these beauties all in 1985 (and published it in
<br />
&quot;Biocybernetics: A Mathematical Model of the Memory&quot;, deposited with the
<br />
Austrian National Library and the University libraries in Wien, Graz and
<br />
Innsbruck TU's), so he needs not redo the work already done. &quot;Zaragoza
<br />
Lectures on Granularity Algebra&quot; repeats the same, a bit more elaborately.
<br />
Easier access can be found via the J of Theoretical Biology, where I discuss
<br />
the combinatorics of theoretical genetics, by comparing information carrying
<br />
capacities of temporally transversal and temporally longitudinal assemblies
<br />
(of things that are here all at the same time, like the cell itself vs.
<br />
things that are read one after the other, like the DNA). A good introduction
<br />
and some proposals as to how to go about structures on sets can be found in
<br />
the online article Messages Transmission By Counting States of Sets,
<br />
published on <a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/resources/preprints.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/resources/preprints.html</a>.
<br />
<p><p>One more point: it is in fact not relevant, what the objects are made of.&quot;
<br />
the possible partitions are object dependent (they depend on properties of
<br />
the object or kind of object in real situations).&quot; is not true.  &quot;At least
<br />
that is so inasmuch as I understand what you said in relation to Scott's
<br />
language &quot; is definitely not what I tried to say. Really, a mathematical
<br />
object has absolutely no properties to start with.
<br />
Instead: What comes out of the deeper investigation of mathematical objects
<br />
that are parts of a set (that gets partitioned according to stochastic
<br />
principles) is, that there appear KINDS or TYPES or ARCHETYPES of (clusters
<br />
of) objects. These can be compared to the physical and chemical objects that
<br />
the natural scientists refer to when they speak of &quot;entries in the periodic
<br />
table of elements&quot;.
<br />
You take a sufficiently big set (somewhere between 32 and 97, for some
<br />
obscure number theoretical reasons), make subsets on it and will see that
<br />
there appear kinds, types or archetypes of objects that are definitely
<br />
present. You cannot avoid meeting these.
<br />
<p>If you understand sociology and market research, you will understand the
<br />
following:
<br />
in any city, in any culture, in any field research, if you ask more than a
<br />
few dozen people, you will have types of answer collections. There will be
<br />
some &quot;really average&quot;, &quot;rather average&quot; and &quot;slightly off-stream&quot; and
<br />
&quot;eccentric&quot; types, characters, kinds or archetypes.
<br />
If you understand this, you have understood the periodic table of elements
<br />
as truth values of a multidimensional partition table of a sufficiently big
<br />
set.
<br />
<p>Cheers to Scott. Does he write letters?
<br />
Karl

<p>I am not sure we can go as far as the last, but his method does
<br />
involve &quot;count how many multidimensional partitions are possible on n
<br />
objects (that
<br />
is: how many distinct group relations can be generated on a set of n
<br />

<br />
the possible partitions are object dependent (they depend on properties
<br />
of the object or kind of object in real situations). At least that is so
<br />
inasmuch
<br />
as I understand what you said in relation to Scott's language.
