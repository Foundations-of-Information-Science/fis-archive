Dear Jerry,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As responding to my saying that
<br />
<p>occurrence of a Planck's quantum is very peculiar in that both the context
<br />
(the particle-like nature) and the contextual elements (the wave-like
<br />
nature) appear simultaneously as bare empirical phenomena,
<br />
<p>you said it to be a very curious statement. This may be a good starting
<br />
point to respond to your various concerns. I would agree with you if the
<br />
above statement is made as an instance of theoretical syllogism. I cannot
<br />
deduce the above as a theoretical deduction in terms of acceptable component
<br />
propositions. The way I understood the above is through observation of
<br />
events or empirical induction. Although I appreciate modal logic as a scheme
<br />
of the classification of logical propositions according to their asserting
<br />
or denying the possibility, impossibility, contingency, or necessity of
<br />
their contents, it is not clear to me how myriad single instances occurring
<br />
in nature fall under the general scheme of modal logic, prior to the
<br />
relevant events. Empirical observations run risks every time they are made.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical questions like you raised mostly refer to what, when, where
<br />
and how. Although the aspects of what and how, may be properly abstracted
<br />
depending upon the questions to be phrased, the other two aspects of when
<br />
and where remain concrete particular throughout without suffering from
<br />
abstractions. Anybody interested in raising theoretical questions, including
<br />
myself too,  presumes a scheme of space and time, in one form or another.
<br />
Unless we have a prior framework of space and time, it would be hard to
<br />
raise questions of when and where. A most weakest framework must be
<br />
homogeneous space and time. Once we accept spatiotemporal homogeneity to
<br />
start with, the real numbers would turn out quite convenient in accessing
<br />
how close or separated once something happens to be located there.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big problem associated with the real numbers is how one could come up
<br />
with the natural numbers. Emergence of the natural numbers to us is what
<br />
emergence of quanta, the atomic numbers and the like is to nature.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation surrounding the issue of information seems very tricky. If
<br />
we stick to the habit of understanding whatever subject matter theoretically
<br />
in terms of component propositions, there would remain no room of being
<br />
further informed once the endeavor is successfully accomplished. Information
<br />
is of no use there. In contrast, if we are willing enough to tolerate
<br />
empirical synthesis of curious or surprising implications for some time to
<br />
come, we may run the risk of making fatal errors. But, there may also be a
<br />
possibility of being informed of a new situation if we are lucky enough.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
