Dear Wolfgang,
<br />
Here are some points your article brings up that I would like
<br />
to comment.   
<br />
Presentation of &quot;information&quot; as a super concept that deserves
<br />
being subdivised into relevant particular concepts is an interesting
<br />
way to addres the subject, as it is true that &quot;information&quot; per se
<br />
addresses an immense field of events.
<br />
Your next point is to propose three fields: Cognition (content of 
<br />
consciousness), communication (common understanding), 
<br />
cooperation (sense embodied in social structures).
<br />
A comment would be about the entry point you choose (in terms
<br />
of complexity) to introduce the concept of information: the level
<br />
of human (cognition). 
<br />
I feel one can take information as beginning to exist at the level 
<br />
of basic life (lower organization level than human), or even
<br />
at the level of matter (see Edwina's approach relative to 
<br />
&quot;informed matter&quot;). But later, in your &quot;unifying perspective&quot;,  you 
<br />
reword this entry point as &quot;self organizing systems cognizing their 
<br />
umwelt&quot;. This wording can be looked at as containing basic life (but 
<br />
not matter). Could you provide more precision about your entry point 
<br />
for information concept introduction ?
<br />
Also, you write that &quot;properties of information in non human 
<br />
domains are usually extrapolated from properties of information in the 
<br />
human domain&quot;. I agree with this statement as being a fact, but do not 
<br />
really understand the rational behind it.
<br />
Indeed, I feel that information really exists, and is to be considered, at 
<br />
levels of organization lower that human. And extrapolating to non human 
<br />
cases the properties of information as understod for human is a bit risky. 
<br />
This because the level of human posseses specific performances (reflected 
<br />
consciousness, highly developped domain of emotions) that are not 
<br />
currently extrapolatable to non human cases. 
<br />
And anthropocentrism may be misleading (one could prefer an evolutionist 
<br />
approach starting from a well understood position at basic life level, and 
<br />
then climbing up the ladder of complexity. Understanding that the nature 
<br />
of human is still to be explained in scientific terms).  
<br />
Then you distinguish two views on information: subjectivist and objectivist. 
<br />
This seems quite close to the two approaches of knowledge: constructivism 
<br />
(knowledge as specific build up of reality by the knowing element) and 
<br />
representationalism (knowledge as a true image of the outside world).
<br />
Would you agree on this comparison ?
<br />
If by any chance you have developped elsewhere some of the points 
<br />
addressed in your short article, please let us know.
<br />
<p>Regards
<br />
<p>Christophe
