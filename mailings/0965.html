<p>
It seems necessary to be aware enough of the man-made (*) activities 
<br />
that are nowadays gravely disturbing the evolvement of our 
<br />
magnificent homosphere.
<br />
<p>(*) I dare to argue that these activities are conceived, designed and 
<br />
accomplished mainly by men, but so far certainly passively supported 
<br />
by diverse kinds of adaptability exerted by self-resigned women
<br />
<p>After the Gulf War (1991) due to the misrule of the authoritarian 
<br />
government - as it was scarcely motivated to attend the needs of 
<br />
Iraq's people - aggravated by the embargo imposed by means of UNO 
<br />
dispositions, quickly proliferated the manifestation of infectious 
<br />
diseases such as cholera and typhus. In addition the malnutrition of 
<br />
children became a national problem that could not be overcome by the 
<br />
UNO's program &quot; Oil for Food&quot; that started to be implemented in 1997, 
<br />
six years later. UNICEF has estimated that the Gulf War and the 
<br />
embargo had been causing the death of 200 children every day or 12 
<br />
children dying every hour according to International Amnesty. UNICEF 
<br />
claims that 95% of pregnant women suffer anemia and 25% of children 
<br />
are affected by grave malnutrition.
<br />
<p>However, it has been, is and will continue being the radioactive 
<br />
contamination caused by the depleted uranium the main problem that 
<br />
the international community should deal with, because it has 
<br />
seriously affected winners and losers in that military confrontation 
<br />
and also those involved in other recent conflicts. This uranium: the 
<br />
U-238, is what causes the ill-defined symptoms, which gradually have 
<br />
been recognized as the marking features of the &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;.
<br />
<p>This question is alarmingly tragic for the future of human life. It 
<br />
arose as the outcome of the way it has been decided to organize the 
<br />
disposal of large amounts of this uranium, which - since 1977 until 
<br />
today - is obtained from the debris generated during the production 
<br />
of nuclear devices and also through the operation of nuclear power 
<br />
plants. Based on an unilateral and shortsighted judgement, derived 
<br />
from very simplified interpretations of what efficiency and 
<br />
productivity must be in these industrial domains, it has been 
<br />
cleverly thought that this uranium can be employed for military 
<br />
purposes in order to increase the impact and power of traditional 
<br />
weapons. Military minds, being also infected by the inhumane trends 
<br />
of the whole civilizing adventure, have been increasingly fascinated 
<br />
by technological innovations conceived and designed for killing a 
<br />
larger number of enemies with a single shoot. Rather recently the 
<br />
technological innovations that made possible the creation of 
<br />
airplanes, motivated military minds to destroy the enemy's 
<br />
possibilities -faster and more effectively - by means of bombing. 
<br />
Pretty soon the same military minds chose to bomb innocent civil 
<br />
people, as a terrorizing procedure that has aimed at making weaker 
<br />
the internal support of the enemy. Nowadays, in the super modern 
<br />
epoch where automation is reducing the number of human resources 
<br />
required for maintaining the functionality of the societies 
<br />
constituted, to create weapons for massive annihilation has become 
<br />
one of the main objectives of those intelligent governors who aim at 
<br />
pushing ahead the progress of humankind. Indeed they have cleverly 
<br />
realized that it is no longer needed to defeat peoples for being 
<br />
submitted and exploited afterwards.
<br />
<p>Therefore the depleted uranium has become, through scientific and 
<br />
technological research, the modern substance employed for covering 
<br />
the conventional munitions used in guns, tanks and airplanes. It is 
<br />
used also for protection of these devices, being included missiles. 
<br />
This is one important aspect of the prevailing civilizing processes, 
<br />
which have been oriented towards the exhaustive exploitation of 
<br />
everything, whatever the consequences, instead of expending money for 
<br />
excellently built depots for depleted uranium whose radioactivity has 
<br />
been estimated may disappear on its own after 4,500 years. After 
<br />
being successfully evaluated such a decision the managers of public 
<br />
organizations dealing with the Defense and the Energy concerns have 
<br />
chosen to offer the depleted uranium, free of charge, to military 
<br />
factories all over the world but certainly being excepted the evil 
<br />
Iraq. At present USA, England, France, Canada, Russia, Greece, 
<br />
Turkey, Israel, Arab monarchies, Taiwan, South Korea, Pakistan, 
<br />
Japan,... at least buy or produce weapons with depleted uranium
<br />
<p>In 1996 and later in 1999, U.S. and OTAN respectively employed bombs 
<br />
with depleted uranium in the territory of the ancient Yugoslavian. 
<br />
Along the last three years the features of &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; have 
<br />
been gradually identified among the population of Irak, Bosnia y 
<br />
Kosovo and also among veteran U.S., British and Spanish soldiers and 
<br />
their children. Hinde Pomeraniec has denounced the immediate effects 
<br />
of being successfully carried out these defense (?) experiments: 
<br />
increasing number of malformations in children recently born, growing 
<br />
rate of unexpected abortions, larger number of cancer in children. 
<br />
Still is insufficiently known all the consequences of these 
<br />
procedures employed for civilization sake.
<br />
<p>¿¿¿#%§&quot;&amp;#%&amp;!!!
<br />
<p>The troubles as a whole are provoking the most serious crisis ever 
<br />
face by humankind. Once again the actions that are causing it are 
<br />
announced for the sake of ordering the functionality of selected 
<br />
countries, though today through the insertion of democratic 
<br />
procedures in order to push ahead the progress of the ultra 
<br />
modernized humanity. A tragic paradox derived from human minds 
<br />
capable of shortsighted and narrow-minded rationality. Many human 
<br />
minds need to be creative enough for building HUMANELY the World 
<br />
Order, as Ludwig von Bertalanffy claimed in the 1960s.
<br />
<p>&quot;...the overall fate of the world depends on the adoption by humanity
<br />
of a new set of values, based on
<br />
a general systems WELTANSCHAUUNG  (worldview)&quot;.
<br />
<p>«We are seeking another basic outlook: the world as organization.
<br />
This [outlook] would profoundly change the categories of our thinking
<br />
and influence our practical attitudes.
<br />
<p>We must envision the biosphere as a whole ...
<br />
with mutually reinforcing or mutually destructive interdependencies.
<br />
<p>[We need] a global system of mutually symbiotic societies,
<br />
mapping new conditions into a flexible institutional structure
<br />
and dealing with change through constructive reorganization.»
