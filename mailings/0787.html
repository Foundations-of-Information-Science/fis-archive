<p>
Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This message addresses several posts from recent weeks.  Response to 
<br />
Karl, Pedro and Christophe are included.
<br />
<p>First, Karl's innovative post of Tue, 24 Sep 2002 13:00:57 +0200 (MET 
<br />
DST), deserves further consideration.  (It is possible that some have 
<br />
already deleted this post so the entire post is attached at the 
<br />
bottom of this message.)
<br />
<p>Karl's brings several important issues into the discussion, 
<br />
scientific issues that are critical to a coherent philosophy of 
<br />
science and for FIS.
<br />
<p>One issue is the concept of &quot;optimization&quot; in biology.  Generally 
<br />
speaking, I fail to find a substantial basis for the concept of 
<br />
&quot;optimization&quot; in biology or medicine.  While local behaviors may 
<br />
appear to be quite desirable, the mathematics of optimization require 
<br />
a maximum or minimum.   But how is a concept of maximum or minimum to 
<br />
be applied to a living system where the flow relationships between 
<br />
internal and external processes are continuous? It seems that one or 
<br />
the other must be held constant in order to invoke an optimum.  But 
<br />
in biological systems, both internal values and external values are 
<br />
variable - this is the very concept adaptability of which we speak! 
<br />
Any suggestions on how to address this dilemma?  (Such dilemmas are 
<br />
avoided by the Herbert Simon's concept of &quot;satisfactory and 
<br />
sufficient&quot;.)
<br />
<p>The second issue of periodicity and the origin of natural 
<br />
periodicity.  I conur with Karl's comments.  The period of biological 
<br />
orbits can be highly irregular.    Searching for the source of these 
<br />
orbits is a critical problem in theoretical biology and medicine. 
<br />
These orbits are closely related to the structure of diseases - 
<br />
displacement of attractors from normal flows.  FIS should be actively 
<br />
involved in creating a solid basis for the description of such 
<br />
orbits, in my opinion.
<br />
<p>Karl's discussion of the role of counting is critical. Again, I 
<br />
concur with the general trust of his remarks, but note some important 
<br />
distinctions.
<br />
<p>The nature of counting is part of the philosophy of mathematics.  In 
<br />
modern educational systems, counting assumes a central role in 
<br />
information processing.  Karl correctly points out that such simple 
<br />
views do not correspond with most biological phenomenon.  I would add 
<br />
that counting in chemistry is highly complex and simple enumeration 
<br />
of the elements present is only the first step.  The distinction 
<br />
between counting with reference to abstract rules and the countings 
<br />
of the natural sciences with reference to natural objects is a 
<br />
critical distinction.
<br />
<p>Karl lists his view of the basic attributes of counting.  I concur 
<br />
that these attributes are important ones, but wish that Karl had 
<br />
selected a different word than &quot;element&quot;.  The chemical &quot;elements&quot; 
<br />
**DO NOT** follow these simple rules.  For examples, the chemical 
<br />
elements are not &quot;equidistant&quot; apart; the chemical elements end after 
<br />
a short series.
<br />
<p>Karl suggests a &quot;dual way&quot; of counting, going back to the sequence. 
<br />
One reading of his paragraph suggests he is thinking of the complex 
<br />
numbers to generate cyclicities, but I suspect he is not referring to 
<br />
the complex plane.
<br />
<p>How is the specificity and sensitivity of biological communication 
<br />
generated?  If not from the natural numbers or the complex numbers, 
<br />
then how?
<br />
<p>Karl:  Is chemical and biochemical counting sufficiently complex to 
<br />
address your concerns about the nature of counting in FIS?  Is 
<br />
correspondence with chemical counting a necessity for biological 
<br />
counting?
<br />
<p>Pedro re-visits to the issue of &quot;Doctrine of Limitations&quot; but I 
<br />
remain unclear about how such philosophy relates to FIS.  I remain 
<br />
concerned that the philosophical doctrines bring hidden sources of 
<br />
causality into the discussion, thereby creating logical fog which may 
<br />
obscure logical clarity.
<br />
<p>Christophe:
<br />
<p>Thank you for your responses.
<br />
I remain somewhat perplexed concerning the potential relations of 
<br />
your MGS and subjectivity.
<br />
When you say (Thu, 3 Oct 2002 22:59:07 +0200 (MET DST):
<br />
<p>&quot;All components of a signal are information. But an information is
<br />
not always meaningful. Only information that has been produced by
<br />
an Meaning Genarator System (MGS) is meaningful (and there can be
<br />
an infinity of MGSs). The meaning is not &quot;something else&quot; added to
<br />
information that makes it becoming meaningful. The meaningfulness
<br />
of an information comes from the origin of the information.&quot;
<br />
<p>I ask:
<br />
<p>Can you provide an example of an MGS that produces meaningless information?
<br />
Can you provide an example of a message that has different meaning 
<br />
for two different meaning generating systems?
<br />
<p>Cheers to All.
<br />

<p><p>Karl's post: Tue, 24 Sep 2002 13:00:57 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear FIS colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Following the recent exchanges on 'Is information a disease?' I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would like to add that the nervous system appears to be optimised 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for an environment with a predictable amount of sensory input. See 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the classic rat experiments --3 populations, &quot;nirvana&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;stressy&quot; environments, with luxurious, demanding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and very overburdening surroundings. The animals in the cage with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;tasks of a middle complexity&quot; had the longest survival. With 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans, sensory deprivation surroundings are a recognised form of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;torture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, the nervous system is definitely prepared for a middle amount of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changes in the surrounding space. This may go back to natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;periodicities and the revolving quality of the Earth (that sometimes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is dark /cold/, sometimes sunny /warm/, imbedded into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;succession of days, moon phases, seasons, etc). One may wonder 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether it is conceivable that life ever evolved in a strictly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stationary /stable/ surrounding. Indeed the basic pattern of life is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;based on periodicity and cyclicity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My contention --jumping to a theoretical science level-- is that we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to let loose the conceptualizations transported by our way of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counting (1,2,3,...) because they carry in an implicit way of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking that does not agree with biological phenomena. The ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behind a basic assumption about the world that are implicit in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counting like 1,2,3,... seem to be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- all elements are alike in their basic unit (there is only one kind of basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;units),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- the distance between elements is the same,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- the increase from one element to the next is the same (the basic element),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- there is no end in sight to this series,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- there are no preferred sizes to elements,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- there are no two basic kinds of elements that cooperate in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generation of a new element.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Instead, one might try to explore the use of an improved way of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counting. In that new way, one would count congruencies between two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different ways of counting, both going back to the sequence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1,2,3,... By following this dual way of counting, we can engineer a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system which:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- uses periodicities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- uses cyclicities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- does have preferred sizes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- does have several different elementary units,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- has two basic realisations, that in their co-operation evolve a new system,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- there is a conspicuous generation of variety in the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The numbering system one uses impregnates one's ways of thinking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very deeply. Then - so have we learnt - if you can rely on something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be actually true, then it is something we may publicly count. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact, that is the etalon on which we gauge whether we think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correctly. The fundamentals of our rational thinking go back to that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;basic counting ability which we have learnt at the age of 6 years: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;this is thinking&quot;. &quot;These are the rules how reasonable thinking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happens&quot;. That style of thinking may be OK in numerous fields of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;learning, but not really suitable for the contemplation and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representation of the living.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So the task for FIS is - in my eyes - to build the new logico-philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;foundations necessary for a rationally enlarged discourse about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biology (&amp; neurosciences) and the whole humanities. Just like the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Encyclopaedists historically worked on a new catalogue of rational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concepts...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
