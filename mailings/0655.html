<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>I cannot avoid the impression that some of us have not yet stepped past the
<br />
magic-mythical phase of the childhood evolution. In this first attempt of
<br />
explaining the world, one assumes that things have a will, an intellect and
<br />
forces. (That is, one cannot distinguish Mother from Non-living yet.)
<br />
If making a system of beliefs out of this idea, one talks about an
<br />
animalistic religion. In this religion, one worships specific trees,
<br />
forests, hills, waters, global truths and the like.
<br />
Newton has put an end to all this by declaring that things do not move by
<br />
themselves, or, if they move, they cannot alter their course out of their
<br />
free will.
<br />
<p>Please let us not go back beyond Newton and
<br />
specifically please let us stop discussing whether a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protein recognises the correct amino acid,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a molecule imitates an enzyme's natural substrate,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one enzyme fools another enzyme,
<br />
and the like animalistic concepts.
<br />
<p>Things have no souls and no free will and will not exert any forces and have
<br />
no insight.
<br />
<p>Do we want to start talking about what can be otherwise? Information is the
<br />
pointing out of one realisation out of many possibilities. That is,
<br />
information points out something which could (have been) otherwise.
<br />
<p>Let me point out again that a contemporary collection of objects carrying
<br />
symbols can be lined up in many different ways and thus serves quite well to
<br />
demonstrate the concept of what could be otherwise. One specific line-up
<br />
carries information insofar as it is one specific realisation out of many
<br />
possible line-ups. One specific overlap structure carries information
<br />
insofar as it is one specific realisation out of many possible overlap
<br />
structures. You can stretch a structure out into a linear sequence and you
<br />
can fold up a linear sequence into a structure and hereby both ways generate
<br />
information. This is what genetics is all about. The relation between
<br />
contemporary and temporally sequenced symbol carrying media is the task to
<br />
concentrate on (and not whether trees and waters have an insight and
<br />
recognise each other).
<br />
<p>Phantasising about forces coming out of thinking and recognising molecules
<br />
is a waste of time.
<br />
Hope you want to let loose childish concepts of things having a free will
<br />
and an insight. We are grown-ups now. Things have no properties on their
<br />
own, only those we look into them. The proposition is to look properties
<br />
unto such things as have no properties so far, that is, into numbers. There
<br />
will be excitement enough with numbers, once we want to start working.
<br />
<p>Best wishes
<br />
Karl
