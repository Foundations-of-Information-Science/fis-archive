Thank you Stan for the comments,
<br />

<br />
they provoked some more comments from my point of view focusing more to the
<br />
other side of the &quot;coin&quot; though...
<br />

<br />
SS:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Entropy production finds its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning in Universal disequilibrium, the result of accelerated expansion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Universe, while self-organization finds its meaning only locally in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;drive for self-realization.
</em><br />

<br />
V:
<br />
isn't the Universe a self-organizing &quot;global system&quot; sustaining its
<br />
internals (with us amidst all the scales and levels of systems) intact by
<br />
means of expansion &quot;in order&quot; to minimise heating effects of Entropy
<br />
production. It cools down to keep us alive and expansion of the Universe is
<br />
a sign of it's &quot;sustainability&quot; and &quot;global long-range correlations&quot;. This
<br />
is local position from global system's (Universe's) point of view.
<br />
Self-organization plays also a global role here.
<br />

<br />
If we look at the history, then we also see that economies that survive
<br />
longest periods of time and expand are not the most aggressive ones. The
<br />
most aggressive empires with their bulky &quot;world domination&quot; plans - all are
<br />
dead. Interestingly some of them were destroyed from inside - the subsystems
<br />
enforced to serve to an empire one bright day refused to do so. So survivors
<br />
are the most relatively sustainable ones - where culture, knowledge plays a
<br />
major role, and not weaponry and number of divisions. What was the Soviet
<br />
Union 50 years ago and where is it now ? What about Maya, Inka, Roman Empire
<br />
&nbsp;Hitler, Stalin, Alexander, Chingiz Chan ? All they were too &quot;hot&quot;- so they
<br />
burned themselves from inside, either were exterminated by a supersystem. At
<br />
certain levels of produced entropy system can no longer sustain its internal
<br />
structure, and self-destruction starts. So whats is left - those whose
<br />
internal Entropy production levels are lower - i.e. where heat due to an
<br />
entropy production is higher than T1 but lower than T2. Natural selection
<br />
and limited heat-resistance of bonds among system parts rules out all that
<br />
are lower than T1 and higher then T2. Its like &quot;entropic niche&quot; of a system.
<br />
So it does not look like entropy maximisation, rather it is an optimization
<br />
task. If we think about apoptosis and destruction of non-sustainable
<br />
cancerous cells - there are some parallels with examples from above
<br />
economies indeed.
<br />

<br />
By the way, number of wars decreases... Sweeden for example hasn't had major
<br />
wars for some 200 years (it did not participate in WW2) and probably is
<br />
among the most sustainable and the most developed countries in Europe. It is
<br />
probably most educated too. It is a nice example where absence of wars plays
<br />
a major role in evolution of sustainable and prospering economy, science and
<br />
technology as well as high prices and the most possibly highest taxes. 
<br />

<br />
Best wishes
<br />
Viktoras

Replying to Viktoras, then to Igor, and then to Søren
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
First to Viktoras, who said:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a clear distinction between entropy and reallocation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resources both from economical and ecological standpoints?
</em><br />
SS: I have argued that in non-perfect Second Law dissipation, waste
<br />
products of better energy quality than heat should also be considered to be
<br />
'entropic'. They certainly function to reallocate resources, as other
<br />
systems can (and do) move in and utilize them. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oxygen is produced by plants as waste. However it is consumed by animals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a resource... Mitochondria wastes lots of energy into their environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still it enables superior systems (cell, organ, body) functioning, moving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or sustaining stable temperatural regime. And, once we speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about money flows - taxes play a role of entropy (just paid my taxes, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it really looks like entropy from internalist positions :) ). Still one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has to admit that taxes are used by a superior system (country) as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resource by redistributing it elsewhere to ensure functioning of its parts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that otherwise would have not influenced each other.
</em><br />
SS: This kind of thing is just the point of my view above. I believe
<br />
that ecosystems (and economic systems) are basically formed by primary
<br />
energy gradients being fragmented by initial poor Second Law dissipators,
<br />
to be distributed by increasingly better Second Law dissipators in a tree
<br />
of consumption ending with heat energy being produced from the final
<br />
dissipators. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Isn't then entropy and (self)organisation like two sides of a coin ? What
<br />
is a loss for one system, may easily become a resource or direct gain from
<br />
a point of view of an embracing superior system. And so on - through many
<br />
scales and embedded systems in a fractal-like fashion... Best wishes
<br />

<br />
SS: Yes, I agree with Viktoras here. I like to distinguish, however,
<br />
between the 'purposes' of the two sides. Entropy production finds its
<br />
meaning in Universal disequilibrium, the result of accelerated expansion of
<br />
the Universe, while self-organization finds its meaning only locally in the
<br />
drive for self-realization.
