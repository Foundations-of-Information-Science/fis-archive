<p>
Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>One of the main avenues for advancing the biological consequences of the 
<br />
new mol. recognition views discussed here might concern cell 
<br />
signaling.  Let me please expostulate a few a ideas about that.
<br />
<p>In principle, the constellation of molecular recognition events that occur 
<br />
throughout the cellular membrane looks ordinary pysico-chemistry, 'business 
<br />
as usual', be it related to receptors, channels, transporters, pumps, or 
<br />
just to pores. Precisely by means of this series of molecular components 
<br />
(the 'signalome' of the cell, to follow the bioinformatic jargon) the cell 
<br />
itself couples specifically to particular happenstances at its outside 
<br />
('abduces' them, as we discussed in this list).
<br />
<p>The term 'abduction' has to be entered because the signalome itself is in a 
<br />
state of flow, and will change quite dynamically in response both to the 
<br />
external items and to the advancement of the life cycle of the cell. And 
<br />
this needs quite a bit of emphasis: by selectively communicating with the 
<br />
environment and by channeling inner/outer resources of free energy the 
<br />
living cell can keep itself 'one step ahead' of the surrounding conditions, 
<br />
and may continue the advancement of its life cycle just by closing or 
<br />
opening the appropriate molecular windows. Putting together the inner codes 
<br />
of the generative information of the cell, plus the catalytic capabilities 
<br />
of its structural machinery, plus the selective communication srategies: 
<br />
the cellular entity may behave 'anticipatorily'.
<br />
<p>This behavior of life departs from mechanics and from ordinary physical 
<br />
matter. The living cell couples to its 'boundary conditions' through 
<br />
COMMUNICATION, and by doing so it separates its informational dynamics from 
<br />
the mechanical coupling through FORCE that belongs to mere mechanics, to 
<br />
the 'non-informed' matter. Along this conceptual thread we could connect 
<br />
with Robert Rosen and his search for a new kind of maths which could 
<br />
describe life --just let us note that dynamically the living matter has no 
<br />
'state'; rather it has a 'phase' that has to be referred to the advancement 
<br />
of a life cycle.
<br />
<p>We have to contemplate a cellular 'factory' that systematically couples 
<br />
generative and structural classes of information in a variable way that 
<br />
depends on the communication results, on the signals picked up from the 
<br />
boundary conditions. This becomes evolutionarily significant up to the 
<br />
point that the whole phenomenon of multicellularity (nervous systems 
<br />
included) is based on the communication strategy --actually most of the 
<br />
effective coding space of the eukaryotic genome is devoted to the signalome 
<br />
molecular agents and their cohort of associated molecules enegaged in the 
<br />
communicational activities. All an organism has to do is to send a 'signal' 
<br />
and let circulate free energy --to let the transfer of knowledge from the 
<br />
generative to the production of a series of structurally acting machines to 
<br />
occur.
<br />
<p>In its own right, communication has to be seen as the third informational 
<br />
dimension of life always, accompanying and orienting the generative and the 
<br />
structural coupling. And perhaps communication can be directly 
<br />
related  with the organismic 'constraints' we discussed last year 
<br />
(Christophe). Constraints would appear just as massive (populational) 
<br />
communication acts.
<br />
<p>The molecular recognition 'frontier' opens new paths both towards physics 
<br />
and towards biology (indeed its discussion is a very long-term concern, far 
<br />
beyond the very limited inroads we could do during these weeks). My 
<br />
personal hope is that it will contribute to put an end to the 'Darwinian 
<br />
constipation' that theoretical biology is suffering from very long ago and 
<br />
will pave the way towards an elegant bioinformation approach.
<br />
<p>Best greetings
<br />
<p>Pedro
