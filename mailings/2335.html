                <p>
                    Dear Colleagues,
                    <br />
                    I have enjoyed the tangent that recent conversations have taken and
                    <br />
                    would like to interject some more visual contributions. This time I
                    <br />
                    will put the textual information up front, within this message. That
                    <br />
                    is probably appropriate, since the projects whose images I send are
                    <br />
                    in large part responses to texts. But, please, do not think that the
                    <br />
                    text has given you the essential information. Images are sent as
                    <br />
                    attachments.
                    <br />
                <p>Jim
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>**********************************
                    <br />
                    The Fountain and Tattoo
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>These two murals were inked directly onto gallery walls with a set of
                    <br />
                    rubber stamps, twenty-six alphabetic compositions and five morphing
                    <br />
                    grids. Both installations were transcriptions of texts from Herman
                    <br />
                    Melville�s Moby Dick. Both texts allude to a quality of
                    <br />
                    indecipherability appropriate to the system of signs that I am using.
                    <br />
                    But they are also sharp reminders of the limits of our perceptions,
                    <br />
                    the cost of our search for certainty, the unknowable core even of
                    <br />
                    that which seems most obvious.
                    <br />
                <p>The grids are animations of a dance sequence that was translated
                    <br />
                    frame by frame from video stills imported into a computer program
                    <br />
                    designed as a bio-statistical tool to detect anomalies in the human
                    <br />
                    brain. Like the alphabetic compositions they punctuate in my murals,
                    <br />
                    these grids map the human body into a patterned system of signs
                    <br />
                    measuring, recording, and obscuring human experience.
                    <br />
                <p>The Fountain, a collaboration with graphic designer Ben van Dyck, was
                    <br />
                    part of a group exhibition titled Water. The timing of the show
                    <br />
                    coincided with a period of national obsession over the inundation of
                    <br />
                    New Orleans and the South Asian tsunami a year earlier. Melville�s
                    <br />
                    speaker might well have been debating policy coverage with an
                    <br />
                    insurance adjustor: damage by wind or water?
                    <br />
                <p>The stamps were applied over a grid of chalk lines. Areas of the
                    <br />
                    wall were painted in spumes of off-white color behind the stamps.
                    <br />
                    More layers of paint veiled sections of inked wall over which my
                    <br />
                    collaborator applied an array of enigmatic markings in string, tape,
                    <br />
                    and tinted plexi-glass. Letters in wood, vinyl, and acrylic quote
                    <br />
                    directly from the text; �from air� at the upper left, �water� at the
                    <br />
                    center.
                    <br />
                <p>Tattoo was installed as part of a solo exhibition of small-scale
                    <br />
                    paintings, drawings, prints, and mixed-media images from my alphabet
                    <br />
                    series. The stamps flow under and around a wine cooler, a fire
                    <br />
                    extinguisher, and two framed drypoint prints of anthropomorphic
                    <br />
                    letters, each tattooed by a morphing grid excised from the paper
                    <br />
                    using a Laser CAMM.
                    <br />
                <p>The title of this solo show, NOW SEE HERE, was adhered to the
                    <br />
                    gallery�s front window in an arrangement of ten vinyl images. There
                    <br />
                    it blended with the street-side parade of vinyl retail signs, the
                    <br />
                    cacophony of names and logos of businesses whose existences depend on
                    <br />
                    being transparently obvious.
                    <br />
                <p>**********
                    <br />
                    But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
                    <br />
                    You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
                    <br />
                    tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
                    <br />
                    settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the
                    <br />
                    knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand
                    <br />
                    in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>************
                    <br />
                    And this tattooing, had been the work of a departed prophet and seer
                    <br />
                    of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on
                    <br />
                    his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a
                    <br />
                    mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in
                    <br />
                    his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
                    <br />
                    volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his
                    <br />
                    own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore
                    <br />
                    destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
                    <br />
                    they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last.
