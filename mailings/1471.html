<p>
Dear FIS,
<br />
it is a pleasure to contribute to a discussion about order and disorder. You
<br />
will (not) be surprised that this again boils down to linearisation of
<br />
structured sets.
<br />
<p>Definition: order means that objects that could be other places are on one
<br />
of specific places that carry symbols that point to those objects that are
<br />
this moment in fact there. (This means: things have properties. Properties
<br />
of things regulate which place they belong to. Places appear to have
<br />
properties that match - in our perception - those of the objects. E.g. in a
<br />
&quot;clean&quot; place one puts &quot;clean&quot; things but not &quot;dirty&quot; ones.) If everything
<br />
is maximally matched to where it belongs, we have maximal order.
<br />
Disorder therefore means that objects are on a place among possible
<br />
differing places that does not suit the match between descriptor_object and
<br />
descriptor_place maximally.
<br />
Now we start to count:
<br />
a) we count how many differences are there among n places;
<br />
b) we count how many differences can there be among n objects;
<br />
c) we count if the proportion between possible charactersitics of objects
<br />
and possible characteristics of places changes as n grows.
<br />
To the results:
<br />
ad a): Places do not have properties of their own. We can assign an
<br />
individual attribute to each place. (Like in a new house, it is not that
<br />
important, where the place for clean and for dirty objects is, but we must
<br />
foresee it, that it is somewhere.) For the individual attributes we take the
<br />
numbers 1,2,3... etc. and we number the places. As the places are the
<br />
background on which order (or disorder) shall be diagnosed, we shall take
<br />
into consideration each and every way the places can be enumerated. There
<br />
are n! ways of assigning a number from among 1..n to an object from among n.
<br />
ad b): Objects have those properties as symbols attached to objects show. On
<br />
a finite set of objects only a finite number of nonredundant, distinct
<br />
symbols can be distinguished. The distinction happens by contrasting objects
<br />
that have a symbol (of a specific kind) with objects that have not this
<br />
(specific) symbol. The meaning of the symbol is derived from the differences
<br />
between those objects that have this symbol and those that have this symbol
<br />
not. (The terms &quot;red&quot;, &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;continuous&quot; are learnt by pointing out
<br />
those that are so and contrasting these to such objects that have this
<br />
symbol not.) Therefore, parts of a set can have only a limited number of
<br />
properties (as there is on a finite set only a limited number of contrast
<br />
backgrounds available).
<br />
A set of n objects can possess E(n)**ln(E(n)) ways of inner differentiation.
<br />
Beyond this number of distinct arrangements of symbols, only repetitions of
<br />
properties that already have been pointed out can happen. About the parts of
<br />
this set everything will have been said (with respect to the inner
<br />
differentiation of its objects).
<br />
Ad c): Of course, as n grows (as we have more objects that can be in an
<br />
orderly or a disorderly arrangement) we have more places these objects can
<br />
be in and also more differences these objects can have among themselves.
<br />
(The more differences the objects have, the more they can be ordered. If all
<br />
objects were alike, they could be neither in order nor in disorder, because
<br />
no one would register that you have changed the position of one object with
<br />
that of another.)
<br />
What is surprising (to me) is
<br />
that the concept of a maximally structured set has so far been neglected by
<br />
mathematics, information theory and combinatorics;
<br />
that it explains very clearly how places and characteristics of objects
<br />
interdepend;
<br />
that it helps understanding why nature uses a long sequence (the DNA) that
<br />
interacts with a broad presence (the cell).
<br />
<p>A more detailed elaboration is to be found in the article published in
<br />
Entropy - thanks to Pedro and Su-Kun.
<br />
<p><p>To the terminology: order can be defined by pointing out one from among
<br />
several possible alternative states of property/place matches. If a thing
<br />
with &lt;this&gt; property is on a place with &lt;that&gt; property then we speak of
<br />
order. If either a thing with &lt;this&gt; property is on a place that has not the
<br />
&nbsp;property &lt;that&gt;; or, on a place with &lt;that&gt; property an object with not
<br />
&lt;this&gt; property, then we speak of disorder.
<br />
The extent of disorder can be measured by using measures of similarity
<br />
between properties and between places and making a matrix.
<br />
<p>Looking forward your suggestions on this.
<br />
Karl
