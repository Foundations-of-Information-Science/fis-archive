Dear Loet
<br />
<p>You wrote:  &quot;The meaning processing in discourse is much richer than the
<br />
lower order systems because it is no longer biologically constrained.&quot;
<br />
<p>This is the traditional humanistic-social science understanding of
<br />
language. But the new understanding is that it is. We are just not aware
<br />
of it. The core of our ability to express our selves is not so much a
<br />
grammatical and logical generative model as it is our bio-social
<br />
embodiment. I would claim that living systems with differently 
<br />
organized bodies would not be able to understand our words. As
<br />
Wittgenstein said &quot;If a Lion could talk, we could not understand it.&quot;
<br />
<p>&nbsp;ritualized seeking for a mate. Thus meaning is biologically
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embodied, psychologically experienced and socially expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and ritualized in language.
</em><br />
<p>Yes, but the next-order system has more control mechanisms (meanings)
<br />
available than the previous-order one. For example, if you observe two
<br />
animal mating, you can
<br />
say that they are mating using a biological language. That is, you have
<br />
a metaphor available for describing this behaviour. However, what it
<br />
means for the animals involved
<br />
is not directly accessible using this metaphor. Perhaps, there is a
<br />
psychology possible for studying these animals, but it may need another
<br />
paradigm than the biological
<br />
one.
<br />
<p>Thus, the meaning generation and processing proliferates at the social
<br />
and cultural level. We do not only use language, but proliferate
<br />
languages by using higher-order
<br />
codes of communication in paradigms. The meaning-processing in discourse
<br />
is much richer than the lower-order systems because it is no longer
<br />
biologically constrained.
<br />
While the individual (psychology) is still facing the problems of life,
<br />
the next-order level of culture is also supra-individual and
<br />
proliferating with a dynamics other than the
<br />
(sum of the) psychological ones.
<br />
<p>The sciences themselves are part of this next-order development. The
<br />
scholarly discourse is the very assumption under Stan's pansemiotics;
<br />
the ground on which he
<br />
stands. But the idea of unifying this into one big metaphor is
<br />
self-defeating. Because the big metaphor remains a metaphor among other
<br />
possible metaphors. At the
<br />
cultural level, it is more useful to use diaphors (distinctions) because
<br />
they can be enriched with meaning and knowledge.
<br />
<p>For example, the transitions between the levels are different. As
<br />
psyches we have no direct access to our body, that is, without providing
<br />
meaning (in language and
<br />
thought) to the signals that we receive. This metaphor is not adequate
<br />
for studying the relations between individuals and society because the
<br />
two systems have more
<br />
means of communication among them in language and symbolic media of
<br />
communication at the same time. At the cultural level there are many
<br />
more options than
<br />
providing a signal with a single meaning.
<br />
<p>Even the concept of &quot;level&quot; entails a biological metaphor. I submit that
<br />
it is more useful to think of the next-order as another dimension that
<br />
stands potentially orthogonal to
<br />
the ones on which it reflects. The projection on the new axis allows us
<br />
to discard most of the incoming information as noise and the keep the
<br />
signal as meaningful
<br />
information.
