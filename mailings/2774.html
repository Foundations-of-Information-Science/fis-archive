                    <br />
                <p>Welcome Robin. You can do little better than to engage John Collier on
                    <br />
                    this. I usually agree with him. But in this message, I will try to color
                    <br />
                    some of his references a bit differently.
                    <br />
                <p>Before we start, you should know that there are several communities here,
                    <br />
                    and you may as well get used to the fact that members from different groups
                    <br />
                    talk past each other. So when you meet each of us virtually, you probably
                    <br />
                    should get an intro as to their basic views.
                    <br />
                <p>I interpret the agenda of FIS as having a particular challenge. I believe
                    <br />
                    we have need of and are close to a new science, that refactors basic
                    <br />
                    abstractions. And that emergent design and information will be the levers
                    <br />
                    into this new collection of mechanisms. I think it will be intellectually
                    <br />
                    disruptive. I think it will resolve several vexing problems in science and
                    <br />
                    greatly better our state. In this, I am not alone.
                    <br />
                <p>Others here have a more tempered view. Some come from the semiotic side and
                    <br />
                    apply those notions to physics and chemistry. They are a particularly
                    <br />
                    articulate group.
                    <br />
                <p>Another rather substantial group I will call the statistical machinists who
                    <br />
                    go the other way in terms of basic abstractions from physics carried over
                    <br />
                    to all phenomenon. They at least have good arithmetic, and that's not be
                    <br />
                    taken lightly.
                    <br />
                <p>You may think of these groups as revolutionaries, neopeirceans and
                    <br />
                    anentropists. While we are pretty levelheaded and generous here - guided by
                    <br />
                    the example of our kind host and moderator Pedro - we do tend to stick to
                    <br />
                    our own religions.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, John said:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The most Wittgensteinian approach to intentionality is, in my opinion, in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Situations and Attitudes by Jon Barwise and John Perry. I think it is
                        flawed,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;as it does not properly incorporate standard logic (this is a problem that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jerry Fodor harps on, a bit excessively perhaps, and to the wrong effect,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;but basically he is right).
                    </em><br />
                <p>(snip)
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is a nice, accessible account of Barwise and Perry in Keith Devlin,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Information and Logic.
                    </em><br />
                <p>John is right about Barwise and Perry, at least initially. But you have to
                    <br />
                    place that in perspective: 25 years ago, when situation theory was cooked
                    <br />
                    up to deal with a fairly quaint and now forgotten linguistic problem.
                    <br />
                    Situation theory in later years under Barwise was used as the basis for a
                    <br />
                    rather clever axiomatic approach to formalizing abstraction mechanisms.
                    <br />
                    This would hardly be characterized as Wittgensteinian, and by this I think
                    <br />
                    you both mean the middle period.
                    <br />
                <p>Perry and Israel have stuck with the original notion as John noted.
                    <br />
                    Devlin's book doesn't merely describe Barwise and Perry, but rationalizes
                    <br />
                    them in a more general domain of formal reasoning.
                    <br />
                <p>As it happens, next week I will be with Devlin. You may have gotten the
                    <br />
                    impression that situation theory does not &quot;properly incorporate standard
                    <br />
                    logic.&quot; This is incorrect in many uses of the system. Many workers,
                    <br />
                    including Devlin with Rosenberg, Barwise in later work, myself with
                    <br />
                    Cardier, and Ginzburg and Sag, work with the system as if it were fully
                    <br />
                    &quot;standard logic&quot; plus an axiomatic basis and workable calculus to include
                    <br />
                    context or alternatively, draw intention.
                    <br />
                <p>Next week with a colleague I am presenting a paper describing an &quot;emergent
                    <br />
                    situation theory&quot; that empowers agent systems with just the sorts of
                    <br />
                    abstractions the revolutionaries here might appreciate to create the
                    <br />
                    emergent behaviors we observe in the world. This mechanism allows agents to
                    <br />
                    build &quot;narratives&quot; from the bottom up and seemingly addresses some of the
                    <br />
                    more vexing problems of the FIS agenda.
                    <br />
                <p>Of course John is on solid ground as well with his approach which by his
                    <br />
                    vocation needs to be more respectful of the past than mine.
                    <br />
                <p>On this, here you will find two different viewpoints. Some will argue that
                    <br />
                    what they present is the correct, best, even the only way. Figuratively,
                    <br />
                    God must have imagined it so.
                    <br />
                <p>I'm with the other camp who believes that all this is a matter of modeling.
                    <br />
                    You choose your abstractions and circumspectly invent your logics to suit
                    <br />
                    what you wish to accomplish and what needs you have of understanding the world.
                    <br />
                <p>Welcome again.
                    <br />
