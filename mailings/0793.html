<p>
In reply to Karl's very interesting post, which I don't claim to 
<br />
understand in full,...
<br />
<p>I very much like the hypothesis that the interactions are logical. I 
<br />
fully agree with this. In my view, our abiotic and biotic realms 
<br />
operate 'as logical orders'. My question concerns the nature of this 
<br />
logical interaction. 
<br />
<p>Karl seems to be dealing with, if I understand him, aggregates of 
<br />
discrete entities. That would be the Gaussian distribution. This 
<br />
assumes that these physical variables already exist - and the 
<br />
archetype is an a posteriori description, a statistical average of the 
<br />
many actualities (hair, skin, eye colour etc). But is this a posteriori 
<br />
statistical average what is really meant by a logical archetype?
<br />
<p>Karl introduces the idea of asymmetry and this, I think, is 
<br />
important, for asymmetry inserts gradients of organization and 
<br />
therefore, establishes interactions between these gradients. 
<br />
Gradients develop within logical structures - and - the relations 
<br />
between these gradients is also logical. This precludes random 
<br />
interactions as the key force in our cosmos, moving randomness 
<br />
(which does exist and remains vital) to the peripheral domain.
<br />
<p>Logical relations establish structures that set up relations of 
<br />
precedence and dominance. It is not just sets and subsets but the 
<br />
principles of interaction that both set up these sets/subsets and 
<br />
also, establish the relations between them. These principles are 
<br />
logical. Key aspects of the logical interaction, I think, are codes 
<br />
that define temporality, so that an earlier form is dominant over a 
<br />
later form (this is an indexical logical relation); and type of code, so 
<br />
that digital (non-local, distributed) is dominant over an analog 
<br />
(situated, undistributed) codification.
<br />
<p>The archetype that I am thinking of would not be viewed as an a 
<br />
posteriori statistical distribution but as an a priori digital type of 
<br />
codification. It would set up energy interactions that produce 
<br />
discrete particles, according to its dominance and precedence in 
<br />
structure. Now- this seems to be a different type of archetype than 
<br />
Karl's. I consider Karl's archetype an important one - which I would 
<br />
call an 'external Thirdness' and the one I am outlining, is an 
<br />
'internal Thirdness'. My suggestion is that our world requires both 
<br />
types.  And - the external archetype or 'normative habit' is not just 
<br />
an a posteriori distribution figured out by humans. It exists in reality.
<br />
Same with the internal one. [That is, I think that 'universals' are 
<br />
real].
<br />
