JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPECIAL ISSUE on:
<br />
COMPLEXITY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM
<br />
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS
<br />
<p>Deadlines:
<br />
Deadline for submission: March 1st 2006
<br />
Reviews returned:   May 5th 2006
<br />
Final Submission:  August 1st 2006
<br />
Publication:  December 2006
<br />
<p>Special Issue Editors:  Yasmin Merali and Bill McKelvey
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet and related advances in information and  
<br />
communications technology are implicated in the emergence of the  
<br />
network economy and the network society. Greater connectivity and  
<br />
access to increased variety and volume of information has generated  
<br />
greater informational complexity, whilst enhanced communication  
<br />
capability makes possible new and complex forms of organisation  
<br />
embodying distributed network structures and processes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quest for coherent integration of social, economic,  
<br />
information and technology networks has resulted in the convergence  
<br />
of strategy, OD and information systems research on issues of  
<br />
information and informating, connectivity, co-ordination, competition  
<br />
and collaboration, learning and transformation at multiple levels of  
<br />
analysis in the networked world. These developments highlight the  
<br />
importance of trans-disciplinary research.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication, informational and representational  
<br />
capabilities conferred by IT have profound significance for social,  
<br />
economic, political and organizational scholars. The opportunities  
<br />
and threats posed by the entanglement of information, economic,  
<br />
political and social networks raise various organizational, IT, and  
<br />
IS performance problems as well as ethical and philosophical issues.  
<br />
One consequence is that scholars from all disciplines have turned to  
<br />
complexity science in their search for new paradigms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complexity science is viewed as a source of concepts for enabling  
<br />
the trans-disciplinary exploration of complex organisation in the  
<br />
network economy and network society. Complex adaptive systems, chaos,  
<br />
emergence, self-organisation and co-evolution are examples of  
<br />
commonly used complexity concepts in this context, and numerous  
<br />
computational techniques are available for modeling the non-linear  
<br />
dynamics associated with these concepts.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambition of this issue is to provide a forum for opening up  
<br />
the IS discipline to perspectives offered by scholars from diverse  
<br />
fields, in order to stimulate a discussion about the changing role of  
<br />
the Information Systems community and scholarship in the  
<br />
interconnected world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental purpose of this Special Issue is to explore the  
<br />
utility of complexity science and its concepts in advancing the  
<br />
development of paradigms for IS research in the networked world. We  
<br />
welcome papers that explore the potential contribution of complexity  
<br />
science to the development of ontological and epistemological  
<br />
constructs deployed to articulate the nature and role of information,  
<br />
IS and IT in the networked world.  Papers that address trans- 
<br />
disciplinary themes are encouraged, as are papers from scholars from  
<br />
disciplines other than Information Systems.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the limited number of papers the Special Issue can publish,  
<br />
we are also preparing a book, and we invite papers for that on the  
<br />
same basis as for this Special Issue. The authors of papers invited  
<br />
for revision will be invited to participate in a trans-disciplinary  
<br />
research meeting on the special issue theme at Warwick Business  
<br />
School. Attendees will be expected to cover the costs of their travel  
<br />
and lodging.
<br />
<p><p>Submission Procedure
<br />
<p>•    Please make electronic submissions.  Word for Windows and  
<br />
Powerpoint are preferred.
<br />
•    Submissions must be sent to both Special Issue Editors at the  
<br />
following addresses:
<br />
Yasmin.Merali&#64;warwick.ac.uk  AND  bill.mckelvey&#64;anderson.ucla.edu
<br />
AND to the JIT Editorial office at jit&#64;templeton.ox.ac.uk.
<br />
<p>•    Submissions will be extensively refereed by two reviewers and an  
<br />
Editor.
<br />
•    Please feel free to contact Yasmin Merali with queries relating  
<br />
to the Special Issue.
