Dear John and colleagues,
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stephen Seely's recent article in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Medical Hypotheses is heading in your direction:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;At an early stage of evolution the body of a higher animal divides itself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into three &lt;compartments, each specialising on a different task of life. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The three parts correspond to the &lt;entoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearing at an early part of ontogenetic development. The task &lt;of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entoderm is metabolism, that of the mesoderm mainly the mechanical aspects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of life, that &lt;of the ectoderm gathering information from and reacting to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the outside world.
</em><br />
<p>You raise a very interesting point that we have not discussed here, on how 
<br />
the organization of cellular communication in the body of an animal 
<br />
conduces to three macro-categories of function. We should include it into 
<br />
future speculations, in relation with the gap between cellular and 
<br />
organismic realms --perhaps it is here where Christophe's notion of 
<br />
'constraints' can be really useful. It is intriguing because the 
<br />
ecto-meso-endo distinction also echoes the three categories I proposed for 
<br />
the dynamics of cellular info (structural, generative, communicational)...
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Re Homo loquens --An exciting prospect. Is Homo loquens an advance on Homo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sapiens?
</em><br />
<p>I think that Homo loquens cannot get a much more advanced position in 
<br />
nature than other Homo or even other Anthopoidea --until writing. The 
<br />
coupling between loquens and the written stuff would remind a Turing 
<br />
machine, its 'body' (or head) is powerless in itself, but capable of 
<br />
universal computing when a 'tape' for writing and erasing binary digits is 
<br />
added. The power of exoinformation, once it gets very well designed (eg, 
<br />
alphabetic writing, arabic ciphers with zero) is that it boosts the mental 
<br />
operations of people, multiplying the social possibilities of collective 
<br />
action.
<br />
<p>But perhaps the direct interplay between the endogenous info (oral 
<br />
cultures, generic group interaction) and the exoinformation stuff is not 
<br />
enough to advance further the analysis. More distinctions would be 
<br />
necessary--entering a third player? I am inclined to enter 'knowledge' (or 
<br />
perhaps 'closure'?) into the game but it looks on a different level than 
<br />
the endo/exo distinction. The items we may consider as knowledge have sort 
<br />
of two legs --going one into each side. Seemingly 'learning' is the leg or 
<br />
the bridge towards the endo, whereas 'validation' goes towards the other 
<br />
side... In 'the social life of information' (Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000) there 
<br />
are very interesting ideas on how the endo (informal group life) and the 
<br />
exo (well-structured knowledge) continuously interact.
<br />
<p>The general problem I see for advancing further distinctions and 
<br />
relationships between endo/exo is the lack of a good metaphor. Once we get 
<br />
too close in touch with the symbolic realm we are at a loss (everything has 
<br />
already been said!). Why we do not try to explore something really 
<br />
different? Although it may sound awkward, the metaphor of the 'mental 
<br />
engine' could be useful to illuminate some aspects of the endo/exo 
<br />
interplay as it occurs within our heads. Like in the Otto or Diesel engine 
<br />
of our cars, circling at fantastic revolutions per minute, and in each 
<br />
cycle performing an astonishingly complex transformation process between 
<br />
forms of energy (pretty well captured in the essential by macroscopic 
<br />
thermo formulations), our brains would run at fantastic speeds performing 
<br />
cognitive (action/perception) cycles that would transform the forms of 
<br />
information... Ideas of our great colleagues Michael Conrad and Tom 
<br />
Stonier, respectively on entropy functionals and on info transformations, 
<br />
could be invoked here, but also from Arbib, Edelman, Erdi... Maybe we can 
<br />
think on approximate formulations that capture the essential of our 
<br />
information (mental entropy) cycles.
<br />
<p>Does it look interesting that we get ahead for a while with the 'roaring' 
<br />
metaphor?
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Our colleague Mohan Karel from Nepal (in his abstract weeks ago) made a 
<br />
proposal from quite an opposite point of view. Should we ponder rather a 
<br />
non-mechanistic metaphor on endo-exo such as Yin-Yang? Could Terry's 
<br />
fractalities or John's optimization trough self-organization be at an 
<br />
intermediate territory between the two?
