Dear Jerry,
<br />
<p>Thank you for this excellent introduction.
<br />
Perhaps, we should consider the asymmetry between &quot;economics&quot; and
<br />
&quot;ecology&quot;. For example, the ecology of economics may be quite different
<br />
from the economics of an ecology. These words get meaning when the
<br />
systems of reference are specified.
<br />
<p>I agree with your appreciation of Bob Ulanowicz's work. I use his work
<br />
extensively in my own work. For example, in:
<br />
&nbsp;&lt;<a href="../../www.leydesdorff.net/th4/index.htm">http://www.leydesdorff.net/th4/index.htm</a>&gt; The Mutual Information of
<br />
University-Industry-Government Relations: An Indicator of the Triple
<br />
Helix Dynamics, Scientometrics 58(2), 2003, 445-467. &lt;
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../users.fmg.uva.nl/lleydesdorff/th4/T(uig">http://users.fmg.uva.nl/lleydesdorff/th4/T(uig</a>).pdf&gt; pdf-version&gt; 
<br />
<p>The relation is mainly the potential production of a negative entropy in
<br />
tripartite relations at the network level. It seems to me that this
<br />
provides us with an elegant indicator of a self-organizing economy.
<br />
However, I don't see the relation with ecological thinking that easily
<br />
because the system of reference is very different in the biological
<br />
case. Of course, the formal models can be similar. However, we should
<br />
not mix them up as in Luis Serra's paper:
<br />
<p>Question 8
<br />
<p>Could our civilization survive in a lower energy and natural resources
<br />
world?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;The survival of our civilization is to be discussed in terms of the
<br />
social sciences (unless one assumes that civilizations are literally
<br />
alive). But this seems only a metaphor to me.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Question 9
<br />
<p>What is the economic-politic-cultural, global paradigm that could help
<br />
humanity to develop the necessary symbiotic relationships with the
<br />
biosphere?
<br />
<p>I doubt that such a paradigm exists. I think that there is compelling
<br />
evidence that the social sciences don't work with a global paradigm. In
<br />
the social sciences, the abandonment of this ideal of a global paradigm
<br />
has been one of the major achievements of post-modernism.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Question 10
<br />
<p>Should we radically change our views on information, both in economy and
<br />
in nature? In other words, should we radically change our means and ways
<br />
of scientific thinking?
<br />
<p>This is a philosophical project if not a theological one. Scientific
<br />
thinking is not so voluntaristic, in my opinion.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Question 11
<br />
<p>Is our present society capable of confronting this challenge?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;I doubt it and I am not too unhappy about that. Society can also not
<br />
solve that there are spots on the sun. But we can sometimes do a lot for
<br />
solving natural disasters technologically.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>The central point is that society is not a living being. Otherwise, one
<br />
arrives at mythical thinking. The great advancement of Galilei was to
<br />
understand that nature is not alive and that it can be made the subject
<br />
of mathematical reasoning without being harmed. Similarly with society:
<br />
it is a network system. The hypothesis that the development of this
<br />
system exhibits autopoiesis is perhaps fruitful as a heuristics. For
<br />
example: Paul Krugman, The Self-Organizing Economy (Malden, MA/Oxford:
<br />
Blackwell, 1996). 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Niklas Luhmann has been mentioned before on this list for his
<br />
contribution in generalizing the notion of society as a functionally
<br />
differentiated system that processes not living, but meaning in an
<br />
autopoietic mode. While &quot;living&quot; is based on the exchange of molecules
<br />
(Maturana), &quot;meaning-processing systems&quot; are predicated on
<br />
communications that are symbolically mediated (for example, by using
<br />
money for making payments). 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>However, it seems parsimonous to me to define &quot;information&quot; not
<br />
specifically with reference to any of these systems, but yet
<br />
content-free. A mathematical definition of information (like Shannon's)
<br />
has the advantage of being content-free. The content-free information is
<br />
provided with meaning when a system of reference (a communication
<br />
system) is specified. For example, when molecules are assumed to be
<br />
communicated, a biology is generated. (When atoms are communicated, a
<br />
chemistry is generated. When prices are communicated, an economy is
<br />
generated. Note that these are hypotheses!)
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>For example, at this list an economy is generated by the (symbolically
<br />
mediated) rule that one is allowed to send two messages in one week. One
<br />
could study the distributions thus generated as an ecology, but the
<br />
exchange of ideas is only conditioned by this ecology and economy. The
<br />
fluxes provide the exchanges with meaning. Hopefully.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>With kind regards, 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear FISers:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The topic assigned by Pedro, &quot;Ecological Economics and Information&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is extraordinarily challenging. The vast scope of these terms is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nearly beyond comprehension.  In these brief remarks, I can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; touch on a few qualitative concepts of central importance in my work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantitative concepts are addressed in Luis's writings which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posted in the accompanying post.   I am deeply grateful to Luis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his views and the assistance of Pedro.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us start by noting that the root of both &quot;Ecological&quot; and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Economics&quot; is the derived from the Greek, oi, oikos (house, home).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A simple implication of this common source of the two terms is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the pair of words, taken together, enjoy a mutual reflexivity.  At
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conceptual level, the common root, &quot;eco&quot;, suggests that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of economics is implicit within the concept of ecology.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rough translation of the reflexivity in a logical sense could be &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; study of the study of the laws of the home.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The semantics of the third term &quot;information&quot; offer many possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations. I choose  to draw from the direct source of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; languaging of the term itself, the notion of information as bringing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form into a system.  An example of this usage of the term information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists of supposing one has an open system and it acquires new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms.  The information acquired by the system introduces new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations within the system.  The acquired forms have a potential to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduce a dynamic within the informed system.  This usage is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closely associated with a general conceptualization of the concept of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To summarize the preceding two paragraphs, one interpretation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phrase, &quot;Ecological Economics and Information&quot;, is a reflection on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the nature of the rules of the flows of a system.  What structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could provide a basis for such a meditation on the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transdisciplinary relationships?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The concept of a system requires a distinction between the &quot;self&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system and the circumstances surrounding the system.  But, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the self of a system?  We might answer this perplexing question by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stating that we can imagine two incommensurate classes of systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One class of systems being defined inside of a boundary.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundary separates the interior from the exterior.  An example of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundary is our skin.  Our language is rich in terms describing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundaries.  Terms such as wall, container, bank, cup, bowl, room,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building, and so forth imply a boundary of one type or another.   The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of a boundary serves as an initial step in generating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of specificity of form.  Thus, in one class of the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classes of systems, we speak of boundaries as one source of form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The concept of boundary is thus deeply entangled with the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity in such systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Boundary-less systems form a second class of systems.  Obviously, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundary-less  systems lack a boundary.  But, the absence of boundary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not mean the absence of an identity.  The relation of boundary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to identity in the first class of systems can be replaced by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-physical boundary.  The boundary becomes an abstraction in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind of the student of the system.  The absence of  a crisp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separation of the interior from the exterior in boundary-less systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not mean the absence of form nor the absence of form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components of the system.  For example, we may speak of an ecosystem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as the &quot;Mississippi River Basin Ecosystem (Miribe)&quot;.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic flow of materials through the Miribe can be roughly estimated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of averages of annual cycles. For example, the cycling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemicals (CO2, H2O, Carbon, N2, minerals, and so forth) recurs each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; year in greater or lesser amounts.   The flow of materials is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative in biological ecosystems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The components of boundary-less systems may possess boundaries.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundaries of components convey specific forms on the components of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Miribe.  Thus, an analysis, a study of the study of Miribe  requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we ask for a classification of the components of the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In earlier work (Chandler, NYAS,vol. 879, 75-86, 1999, vol. 901,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 75-85, 2000)  a suitable classification of systems was developed. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed classification is organic.  That is, a degree of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organization is used to distinguish among components.  The chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis of the classification provides a natural relation with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological systems without discarding the concept of distance.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organic basis of the scale, grounded in the atomic numbers of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical elements, provides an intrinsic meter for counting and for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accounting of relations in terms of semantic names of components.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a simple, direct scientific classification that separates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components on the basis of the degree of organization rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linear distance or arithmetic operations .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The categories are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 1 subatomic particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 2 chemical elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 3 molecules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 4 biomacromolecules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 5 cells
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 6 organs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 7 individuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 8 populations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O° 9 ecosystems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O°10 planet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The objective of this categorization is not to give a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything.  Rather the objective is to provide a basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflection on the structure of scientific languages and the potential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for relations among these scientific languages in nature. Other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categorizations can add finer structures to the distinctions.   Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degree of organization provides a &quot;home&quot; for a collection of terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and scientific theories.  Frequently, individual terms may be used in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple layers or stages or hierarchical levels or degrees of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organization. The multiplicity of usages generates a polysema that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strongly influences communications among different scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subdisciplines. Usage of a term in multiple degrees of organization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduces uncertainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The concept of communication varies with the degree of organization.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the levels of O°1, O°2, and O°3, communication occurs as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical process of interaction.  At levels O°5, O°6, O°7, and O°8,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the principle means of communication are by active acquisition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Components of levels O°5, O°6, O°7, and O°8, have acquired the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capacity to generate information, to transmit information and to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpret information.  Commutative relations among information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creation, information transmission and information re-arrangements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are essential features of biological and social structures. At the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of ecosystems, information flows include possible permutations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of information flows among the individual components of each degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of organization. A general approach to analysis of combinatorial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components of informational signals is needed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The concept of relation differs among the categories of organization.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, a biological relation may be expressed in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descendents and sexual mating activities.  A chemical relation may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressed in terms of bonds among elements and molecules.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical relation is ordinarily expressed in terms of functions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mappings between two abstract objects, a domain and a codomain.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different nature of the concept of relation between different degrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of organization contribute to polysema.  It also can restrict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculations and accounting principles for the individual economies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within an ecosystem.  Relations within an ecosystem include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, chemical and biological relations, that is, ecosystems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are polyralational. The polyrelational nature of human health is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful metaphor for the polyrelational nature of ecological economics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The ordinary usage of the term &quot;economics&quot; includes the concept of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic flows of goods and services within a system and among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neighboring ecosystems.  The dynamics of flows within ecosystems is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of enormous perplexity which is far beyond the scope of these brief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remarks.  A few sentences introduce the critical features.  The flows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include physical and material flows.  One flow of particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance to all ecosystems is the continuous flow of oxygen and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon dioxide.  The genesis of the planetary balance between plants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and animals depends on the release of oxygen by plants after the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon has been separated the &quot;dioxide&quot;. This gift of oxygen from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plants to animals establishes the basis for respiration in the animal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kingdom and is essential to the mammalian lifestyle.  Other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ecochemical cycles (nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, etc) are critically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important to sustaining the life cycles of both plants and animals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantitative work on ecological information flows is not common.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, the work of Robert Ulanowicz must be noted. His book, Growth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Development, Ecosystems Phenomenology (1987) deploys Shannon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information principles in the analysis of ecosystem flow data.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequent work, Ascendency, discusses both theory and observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His views have influenced the development of the perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presented here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The perplexity of polyrelational systems requires the study of mutual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations among systems representing different degrees of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organization.  For example, the planetary cycles of chemical flows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are sustained by biological life cycles.  Biological life cycles are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sustained by chemical flow cycles. Sustainable flows thus emerge from
</em><br />
