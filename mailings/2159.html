                    I don't think so, I give an account of causal connection without
                    direction (direction enters only with dissipation) in my Causation is the
                    Transfer of Information. It is completely compatible with mechanism. A

                    I don't see this. There are natural differences, or else there would be
                    no perceived ones. One of the fundamental premises of perception theory
                    is that something has be there in order for us to perceive it. Even
                    Berkeley had the differences in the mind of God.<br><br>

                        This is where Peirce suggests his category of Firstness which is a
                        Hypercomplex chaos with a tendency to take habits. That makes evolution
                        possible. </blockquote><br>
                    This is somewhat similar to David Layzer's view in Cosmogenesis. But he
                    thinks the chaos exists (see below).<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite="">But he also adds that there must
                        be a kind of pure feeling there in order to make distinctions. This is
                        what I think most of you wants to avoid, because this is traditionally
                        part of the scientific project to explain the wolrd without any mind
                        qualities in the beginning.<br>
                    </blockquote><br>
                    Pure feeling does not exist for Peirce. It is real, but only seconds
                    exist. Peirce is very clear on this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    &quot;So, then, there are these three modes of being: first, the being of
                    a feeling, in itself, unattached to any subject, which is merely an
                    atmospheric possibility, a possibility floating <i>in vacuo</i>, not
                    rational yet capable of rationalization; secondly, there is the being
                    that consists in arbitrary brute action upon other things, not only
                    irrational but anti-rational, since to rationalize it would be to destroy
                    its being; and thirdly, there is living intelligence from which all
                    reality and all power are derived; which is rational necessity and
                    necessitation.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A feeling is what it is, positively,
                    regardless of anything else. Its being is in it alone, and it is a mere
                    potentiality. A brute force, as, for example, an existent particle, on
                    the other hand, is nothing for itself; whatever it is, it is for what it
                    is attracting and what it is repelling: its being is actual, consists in
                    action, is dyadic. That is what I call <i>existence</i>. A reason has its
                    being in bringing other things into connexion with each other; its
                    essence is to compose: it is triadic, and it alone has a real
                    power.&quot; ('Some Amazing Mazes, Fourth Curiosity', CP 6.342-343, 1908)
                    <br><br>
                    So unless one thinks that perception is merely the having of ideas,
                    perception involves at least secondness. No pure firsts exist.<br><br>
