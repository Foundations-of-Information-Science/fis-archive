<p>
Steven,
<br />
As a painter, I can relate most closely to your discussion, but I am not 
<br />
sure I can sensibly  discuss it.
<br />
<p>Does painting have meaning?: of course, as a form of human intentional 
<br />
activity it has meaning.
<br />
<p>Does a painting have meaning?: maybe not.  Suppose for a moment that having 
<br />
a meaning is  an indication  of failure. if the artist has intentionally 
<br />
done everything possible to make every element of his or her work 
<br />
absolutely interdependent so that no part can be extracted without 
<br />
destroying the whole.  The reverberations amongst the parts are what make 
<br />
it what it is..The trace is perhaps then only information but not meaning.
<br />
<p>In that case, meaning, (I am thinking in a pedestrian way about paintings 
<br />
whose meaning is discussed through verbal language, perhaps occasionally 
<br />
through mathematics or geometry --as in Michael Leyton's work-- or some 
<br />
other system of signs), meaning can no longer accomodate the experience, 
<br />
particularly the sensory elements of the experience.  What is left, 
<br />
stripped of those elements, is an empty shell. Perhaps the explanation is 
<br />
not the meaning, but only pointing to the meaning, which remains within the 
<br />
experience.  But if the meaning is not extractable from the experience, 
<br />
then can we say that there is a meaning at all?
<br />
(My lack of background in philosophy and science is leading me into a 
<br />
quagmire here. I wish I were better prepared to understand all the elements 
<br />
of your discussion)
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my wish to refuse meaning an impossible  wish for an art of 
<br />
irreducible essence,and perhaps really rather silly?  Yet, some examples, 
<br />
particularly in music, being discussed here seem to approach that state.
<br />
<p>We clearly don't approach other phenomena with the same severe restrictions 
<br />
as I have expressed above concerning art, which casts serious doubt on my 
<br />
prejudices.  That is why these fis discussions continue to fascinate me, as 
<br />
incomprehensible as they mostly are to me.
<br />
<p>Jim Cogswell

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear FISers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Last postings, that have dealt with the very difficult and interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic of meaning (even the meaning of meaning has been questioned and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analyzed), have reminded me the discussion about music and information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which, if I am not wrong, Juan G. Roederer made the question &quot;what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; music?&quot;  Of course, the context and central topic of that discussion was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very different, but at least in my modest opinion it is connected with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the present discussion. I would appreciate a lot to know your opinions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the meaning of music.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it correct to say that music as a form of communication has a meaning?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what about other forms of art (painting, sculpture, poetry...)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that we have some FIS colleagues from Arts and Humanities fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and/or very close to them,  I would appreciate a lot that they share with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us their perspective.  Maybe this issue could provide a bridge of formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection between science and humanities... don't you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best regards,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Luis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are a few of the things that keep me awake at night.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So here is the perspective of a modern semiotician interested in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundations of such questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meaning is the experience of the trace of experience left by a sign -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where a sign is the individuated experience of a mark.  All individuated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences are signs.  The subjects of signs are marks.  Marks are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either natural marks arising from nature or metaphysical marks arising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from intent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A definition is the meaning / sign pair.   Only by the assembled set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions embodied by the organism can it distinguish between signs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose subjects are natural marks and signs whose subjects are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical marks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you care about such things you might look at it this way:  imagine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embodied set of meanings as a complex vector space where each state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vector represents a trace of experience, imagine each sign as existing in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a similar complementary space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, in this generalization it really does not matter if we are speaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of music, painting, or theatre.  Equally it does not matter if we speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the marks of literature, science or the stars.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The distinguishing factors are the nature of meaning synthesis that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; marks undertake in the organism and the learning of convention that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surrounds them. There are two forms of meaning synthesis, formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synthesis and intuitive synthesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [As an aside, to see how this works consider the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astronomers and astrologers.]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, to answer your question directly I will cast it so:  How does an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organism distinguish between the music of Beethoven and the song of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lark?   And depending on the nature of the organism the answer is it can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or it cannot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A member of our species that is newly born cannot distinguish the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it has not yet learned the formal conventions that allow it to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It will treat the birdsong and Beethoven in precisely the same way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, the question of communication extends from this model. Is it correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that music as a form of communication has a meaning?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is. But again the question is no different than that which relates to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication in general.  The distinguishing factor between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical marks left by artists and those left by scientists is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intent - where intent is the meaning state evoked within the creator of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mark in the creation process (which I call semiosis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does it make sense to say &quot;What did Beethoven intent in his fifth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symphony?&quot;  Only if you are interested in Beethoven's internal processes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but not otherwise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Artists, in general, are nature's provocateurs. We often use ambiguity to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provoke questions and challenge convention.  Scientists, by contrast,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seek to establish convention.  We do so to enable reliable communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of knowledge about the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your next question should relate to the notion of &quot;truth.&quot; :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The answer to that question and background to my particular work can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; found at: <a href="../../www.what-it-all-means.com/default.htm">http://www.what-it-all-means.com</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since I anticipate the question I will answer it here.  Truth is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.  It is the map between what we know (our experience-of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embodied complex vector space of meaning) and the way things are.  Can we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate truth by any means?  Beethoven or Einstein?  No.  Each of us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must individually undertake the labor to construct an internal definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set that can enable that rare experience.  There is, after-all, no royal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; road to geometry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With respect,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Steven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
