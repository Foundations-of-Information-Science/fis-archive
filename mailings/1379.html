<p>Friends -
<br />
<p>I am sorry to have been absent from the 
<br />
discussion recently. It looks like some very 
<br />
impressive ideas have been introduced and 
<br />
massaged a bit. But I am a little concerned that 
<br />
we may have strayed a bit from what I thought 
<br />
this group was about.
<br />
<p>It is my impression that the reason for FIS to 
<br />
exist is to explore the relatively new idea that 
<br />
there is a discourse of sorts among chemical 
<br />
entities and similarly among physical ones; that 
<br />
the nature of the &quot;information&quot; of this discourse 
<br />
needs to be induced (taking out the human 
<br />
observer); and further that if some new, 
<br />
non-human based notion of information can be 
<br />
distilled then universal mechanics of such things 
<br />
as evolution and emergent behavior can be 
<br />
usefully applied across many disciplines.
<br />
<p>The key here is not to discuss what WE think 
<br />
information &quot;is,&quot; rather what do CHEMICAL 
<br />
ENTITIES &quot;think&quot; it is. I believe nearly all our 
<br />
precedents - our giant minds of the past - fail 
<br />
us on this score because they entangle the 
<br />
notions of knowledge and insight with information.
<br />
<p>Pedro has wisely led us through examination of 
<br />
some candidate abstractions and notions. But this 
<br />
most recent one has pitfalls; I think perhaps 
<br />
because &quot;meaning&quot; is too fraught with 
<br />
anthropomorphic overtones to be very leverageable 
<br />
for the FIS agenda. Therefore we may have gone 
<br />
into a rather off-topic albeit interesting 
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<p>This message is in response to Pedro's 
<br />
reintroduction of the question whether sets, 
<br />
groups or categories are more fundamental to the 
<br />
&quot;conversations&quot; within the chemical and physics 
<br />
domains. Since introducing the question, I have 
<br />
struggled with this quite a bit.
<br />
<p>I think natural numbers, symmetry and time are 
<br />
probably elements of this primitive notion of 
<br />
information, possibly in that order. I think we 
<br />
should be thinking of transformation or process 
<br />
rather than identity and therefore functions 
<br />
instead of operations. Identity in this context 
<br />
is a question of history; I believe time is 
<br />
always retrospective and never conditional. 
<br />
Causality is an imputed notion.
<br />
<p>This - I'm simplifying here - has led me to 
<br />
prefer groups rather than sets in thinking about 
<br />
the mathematics. It allows for both geometric and 
<br />
algebraic operations, provides for simple 
<br />
abstraction mechanisms, and can be structured to 
<br />
be sparse and purely symmetry-based. &quot;History&quot; of 
<br />
the kind that seems appropriate is accommodated 
<br />
and the mechanics are natural to those frequently 
<br />
employed by physicists and chemists.
<br />
<p>I am attracted to Leyton's work because it is a 
<br />
workable instance of something close to what we 
<br />
need. To make it applicable we've got to retool 
<br />
the cognitive mechanics, something that will give 
<br />
Michael fits I suspect. I plan on meeting with 
<br />
him after Easter to see about this and will 
<br />
report back.
<br />
<p>I'm talking here about the notions native to the 
<br />
primitives involved. In order for us to REASON 
<br />
about this (another matter entirely) I see no way 
<br />
out of a categorical logic. That's the new 
<br />
science part. As I have said before, I'm very 
<br />
impressed by Barwise's work toward a new 
<br />
information theory as a candidate for this.
<br />
<p>Away with sets, I say! Peirce is marvelous, but 
<br />
inapplicable, as with Shannon and the overly 
<br />
encumbered regime of entropy. I think this 
<br />
upcoming session will be another attempt to 
<br />
stretch a rabbit skin over a horse.
<br />
<p>We need to be very clear about this: there are 
<br />
two vocabularies involved: that which the species 
<br />
uses to organize and affect others and that which 
<br />
we use to reason about (create science about) 
<br />
those effects and systems. Groups and categories 
<br />
are likely not what we need, but they seem to get 
<br />
us closer to what Jerry calls an &quot;organic&quot; 
<br />
mechanics of information.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
