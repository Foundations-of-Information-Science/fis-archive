Dear Loet,
<br />
<p>thank you for picking up the discussion. I understand you to mean that
<br />
&#x201c;While observation can be observed without further reflection, the
<br />
specification of a redundancy and thus a selection operating requires a
<br />
theoretical specification of the system of reference. This system of
<br />
reference is always specific and therefore there can be no general theory of
<br />
order and disorder.&#x201d;
<br />
<p>Please allow me to point out that the Set N (1,2,3,&#x2026;) is indeed firmly
<br />
rooted in a theoretical specification of the system of reference.
<br />
That the Set N is specific is a point one may discuss long about, presumably
<br />
arriving at the definition of the word &#x201c;specific&#x201d;. If anything can be
<br />
general in science (non-specific, transcending each specific science), then
<br />
it is &#x2013; so I believe &#x2013; the system of measurements (that is, the set N).
<br />
<p>Hope to have given you back the faith in the possible theoretical existence
<br />
of a general theory of order and disorder.
<br />
<p>Karl

Betreff: [Fis] general theory of order and disorder
<br />
<p>Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From an evolutionary perspective order is a consequence of selection.
</em><br />
Selection and variation belong together as two sides of the same coin. For
<br />
example, one can consider the expected information content of a distribution
<br />
as a measure for the variation, and the complement of the redundancy as an
<br />
indicator for the selection. However, the epistemological status of the two
<br />
concepts is different. There are specific theories of communication and a
<br />
mathematical theory of communication (as the formal abstraction of the
<br />
specific theories of communication), but the one theory cannot be reduced to
<br />
the other. In other words, these theories can be considered as specific
<br />
windows on the complex dynamics or the chaos. The various theories are
<br />
differently codified and therefore expected to specify different selection
<br />
mechanisms.
<br />
<p>At the formal level, one can note that if a variation occurs, other variants
<br />
must have been deselected. Thus, a selection mechanism can be infered. The
<br />
selection mechanism, however, has the status of a hypothesis. For example,
<br />
in biology one operates with a notion of &quot;natural selection&quot; which allows
<br />
for the specification of (non-observable) missing links. The operation of a
<br />
market on commodities as another selection mechanism can be expected to be
<br />
different from &quot;natural&quot; selection because markets are not natural, but
<br />
culturally constructed. For example, selection mechanisms on the market may
<br />
differ with institutional and constitutional frameworks among nation states.
<br />
<p>Selections can be selected, for example, for stabilization. Selection
<br />
operates at each moment in time, but stabilization operates over the time
<br />
axis. Stabilizations can be selected for globalization. Thus, selections are
<br />
recursive operations. The generate order from the chaos of variation, but
<br />
this order is produced reflexively, that is, in terms of (scientific)
<br />
discourses. Of course, the orderings refer to external realities and can be
<br />
tested against them. This plays a role in the further codification of the
<br />
scientific insights that are retained.
<br />
<p>Is this a general theory of order? I would say &quot;no&quot; because it denies the
<br />
next-order from either the formal theorizing (math) or the substantive
<br />
theorizing. The latter is addressed as soon as one asks &quot;what is
<br />
communicated when the system communicates&quot;. For example, in classical
<br />
physics the system communicates in terms of energy and momenta (because
<br />
these two quantities have to be conserved). In addition to conservative
<br />
systems, we entertain also notions of dissipitative systems. They provide us
<br />
with yet other discourses. In summary, the order is a knowledge-based order.
<br />
<p>Let me finally note how this relates to the issue of symmetry. If one
<br />
observes a variation which provides the impression of symmetry, one can
<br />
proceed by raising the question of the mechanism which produced the
<br />
symmetry. This mechanism will have to be articulated in one scientific
<br />
discourse or another. Symmetry is not an essential characteristic of a
<br />
presumed &quot;reality&quot;, but an attribute provided by the reconstructing
<br />
discourse.
<br />
<p>With kind regards,
<br />
<p><p>Loet
