Dear Birger,
<br />
<p>your point is important. I will have to let it partly unswered now as I am 
<br />
leaving for vacations. This was exactly what I tried to say when I 
<br />
rised the question of analogy, equivocity or synonymity concerning 
<br />
the use of the information concept in different fields. I can 
<br />
understand the use of a 'general concept of information' in the sense 
<br />
we have been using the concept of  _causa formalis_ and indeed the 
<br />
concept of _form_ in philosophy (metaphysics). The concept of form 
<br />
was use for instance to say: the soul is the form of the body, and: 
<br />
the form of this wood is a chair. The peculiarity of the FIS-approach 
<br />
is the evolutionary approach. With qualitative different levels of 
<br />
reality with have also qualitative different information concepts 
<br />
related to phenomena that could not be forseen from the former level.
<br />
In other words, we have to take always the specific parameters of the 
<br />
phenoma we study whe we talk about information as a domain-related 
<br />
concept, but we can take this concept in the sense of the _causa 
<br />
formalis_. Is this a better way of thinking? Maybe. 
<br />
Concerning LIS (Library and Information Science) we have indeed to 
<br />
introduce specific differences as we have to do with actors and 
<br />
observers capable of language. I think Luhmann's difference between 
<br />
_Mitteilung_ (communication) and _Information_  (and _Verstehen_ 
<br />
understanding) is a useful paradigm. We have being dealing with with 
<br />
problem of understanding (hermeneutics) of 'Information' but not 
<br />
being much aware that there must be something like an offert 
<br />
(_Mitteilung_) out of which the system can create a new 
<br />
understanding. The concept of _Mitteilung_ was, ironically, a basic 
<br />
idea of the processes done by _Hermes_ as the god who brought the 
<br />
messages, announcing them (he was also the god of commerce and thief: 
<br />
all this is part of our joy, isn't it?!)
<br />
With kind regards
<br />
Rafael

<br />
<p>Dear Rafael (and discussion group), 
<br />
<p>I could not quite follow your answer about the human versus the physical
<br />
information concept, and Ill try to reformulate my question. 
<br />
<p>First, we are a group discussing FIS. In this group I know that Soren is
<br />
also connected to the LIS field, and that you have published
<br />
&quot;Hermeneutic der Fachinformation&quot; which I also regard as connected to
<br />
the LIS field. But most other people in the LIS field are not members of
<br />
this group, but have a lot of other journals, seminars, conferences, and
<br />
so on. And: Most members of this group may understand the concept
<br />
&quot;information science&quot; in quite another way than I do. So: What do we
<br />
mean by information science, and consequently: what do we mean by
<br />
information? Who have the authority to define these concepts? 
<br />
<p>Secondly, F. Machlup (1968) in the book &quot;The study of information.
<br />
Interdisciplinary messages&quot; claimed, that the concept of information
<br />
always has a human informant. Somebody is informing someone about
<br />
something.  Information in the sense &quot;DNA contains information about
<br />
individuals&quot; is only information in a metaphorical sense (and should
<br />
thus be written in &quot; &quot;  - as you told in your first answer). F. Machlup
<br />
is one opinion (or theory) about the concept of information. For my
<br />
purpose, I see a dilemma in adopting F.Machlup's view. The positive side
<br />
is that it helps delimit the object of information science. The negative
<br />
side is, that it does not allow studies comparing users utilization of
<br />
&quot;texts&quot; versus natural information sources (like DNA). 
<br />
<p>Many in this group may say, that they are not interested in limiting IS
<br />
to documents, texts, or what information professionals do in electronis
<br />
databases. They are interested in a much broader concept: everything
<br />
(physical, biological or mental) , that can inform everything else.  If
<br />
this is the case, let us use a little time to discuss, what the
<br />
implications of the claim of such a science might be. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
kind regards, 
<br />
Birger
