<p>
Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>In my second cent this week, let me expand the arguments on possible 
<br />
enlarged acceptations of consilience (I hope that better informed parties 
<br />
will progressively enter in the discussion of its strict logical sense too).
<br />
<p>I will start with a short &quot;time travel&quot;. During recent decades we have 
<br />
witnessed a number of intellectual fashions and scientific schools that 
<br />
have emphasized the importance of interdisciplinarity, multidisciplinarity, 
<br />
transdisciplinarity, etc. For instance: systems science,  nonlinear science 
<br />
(irreversibility), &quot;new age&quot; science, complexity sciences, etc. Earlier on, 
<br />
logical positivists were engaged in similar discussions around the unity of 
<br />
science and its methods against a motley crew (holists, organicists, 
<br />
idealists, etc.); several types of &quot;reduction&quot; within a hierarchical scheme 
<br />
of the sciences were advocated. We might go earlier on --perhaps to the 
<br />
time where Ortega y Gasset, Whitehead and other scholars (unfortunately 
<br />
&quot;full of dust&quot; nowadays) made eloquent allegations on the evolution of the 
<br />
social system of knowledge (its lack of balances), the &quot;barbarism of 
<br />
specialization&quot;, the &quot;overextension of paradigms&quot; (outside their proper 
<br />
disciplinary bounds)...
<br />
<p>To sum up, in spite of elegant writing and a number of classification 
<br />
schemes of the sciences (Comte, Dilthey, Carnap, Bertalanffy, 
<br />
Hempel,  Bunge...) one can find not much substance about the much 
<br />
publicized phenomenon of interdisciplinarity (for simplification I drop all 
<br />
the multi-trans- terms). While, in fact, the interdisciplinary mixing has 
<br />
been widespread as most of scientific progress occurs following the 
<br />
turbulences of those disciplinary encounters (origins of computers, 
<br />
'molecular biology', bioinformatics, neurocomputation... to name but a 
<br />
few). How could one find out about the &quot;systematization&quot; of such 
<br />
interdisciplinary phenomena or ponder about interdisciplinary ways of 
<br />
&quot;explanation&quot;, or about some general interd. &quot;method&quot;?
<br />
<p>Following the dominant metaphor of disciplines as &quot;fields&quot; I presented in 
<br />
FIS Madrid 1994 a scheme of the systematic emergence of 
<br />
inter-subdisciplines out from the vertical overlapping of the basic 
<br />
sciences --the big &quot;canonical&quot; ones that we usually assume as models on 
<br />
what science is or should be. See an interesting series of figures at 
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/fis94/introduction.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/fis94/introduction.html</a>
<br />
that show how can systematically emerge up to a couple of dozens, or so, of 
<br />
different subdisciplines. In the figures, every number corresponds to an 
<br />
existing subdiscipline formed by a basic science working outside its 
<br />
&quot;preferred&quot; level e.g., 1: chemical physics, 2: biophysics, 5: 
<br />
biochemistry, 8: psychobiology, 10: psychosociology, etc. (see figures and 
<br />
complete text). Horizontally, there appear the 'object oriented' 
<br />
integrative disciplines: e.g., engineering, physiology, anthropology, and 
<br />
so on. The proposed information science and its vertical overlappings with 
<br />
the other basic sciences also appear in the figures. Some of these info 
<br />
sci. overlappings might roughly correspond with recent interdisciplinary 
<br />
explorations (molecular computing, bioinformation, artificial intelligence, 
<br />
artificial life, etc.)
<br />
<p>Apart from a possible systematicity or taxonomy in the occasions of 
<br />
interdiciplinarity, the questions on the interdisciplinary methods look 
<br />
much pressing. Let us note that the previous &quot;field&quot; metaphor of science 
<br />
has been carried over to the social discourse with relevant success, eg., 
<br />
by Vannevar Bush and his &quot;Endless Frontier&quot; --the emphasis was then, many 
<br />
decades ago, on exploring the outside, expanding the 'borders' of the sci. 
<br />
territories. Whereas that image may be more or less appropriate for the 
<br />
expansion of the canonic sciences (or to discuss about the &quot;limits&quot; of 
<br />
science), one could argue al least about a contemporary change of emphasis. 
<br />
If one witness the literature on sustainable development, climate change, 
<br />
ecosystem dynamics, sociopolitical and entrepreneurial management, 
<br />
etc.,  the crucial importance of interdisciplinarity becomes obvious. So to 
<br />
speak, it is the INTERNAL FRONTIERS of sciences that have ostensibly become 
<br />
of importance for our collective survival.
<br />
<p>Let me venture an opinion on the workings of those internal frontiers, on 
<br />
the &quot;interdisciplinary methods&quot; that are established there (although the 
<br />
term &quot;Int. Meth.&quot; could be close to be an oxymoron), and perhaps about its 
<br />
relative absence in the literature. For a long time I thought that in 
<br />
actuality interdisciplinarity becomes an &quot;art&quot; ---somehow, only criteria of 
<br />
economy, aesthetics and intellectual pleasurability could help in such 
<br />
navigation. Sort of &quot;the Art of Interdisciplinary Explanation&quot;. I already 
<br />
made several postings in this list  close to that intuitive idea.
<br />
<p>But the approach to consilience after reading several publications on its 
<br />
enlarged version (Wilson, Emery, Berthoz, Ceccarelli), including the recent 
<br />
exposure to Malcolm's more rigorous stuff, would suggest me that in those 
<br />
few crucial places at the borders between disciplines --genuine 
<br />
'checkpoints' where an efficient traffic and even an autonomous production 
<br />
may be established-- a deep logicality is at work. There, the consilience 
<br />
dynamics between  very separate &quot;inductions&quot; (heterogeneous 
<br />
conceptualizations and methods) does not return empty or with irrelevant 
<br />
stuff, but full of insights and pathways to explore. Strict consilience 
<br />
might be used to explain the enlarged one. And in that line, it is also 
<br />
probable that quite a few of the fis discussions on the conundrums of 
<br />
informational dynamics could help to establish a new interesting doctrine 
<br />
of interdisciplinarity...
<br />
<p>Thanking your patience!
<br />
<p>Pedro
