<p>
Dear Koichiro,
<br />
<p>thanks for your answer. I will comment your ideas separetaly from the 
<br />
ones by  Soeren.
<br />
<p>1) Dichotomies:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;(Western) Philosophy has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;been asking itself for centuries about the possibility of the 'out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;there' and the question of a bridge (quaestio de ponte) between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;'there' and 'here'. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Ain't there still many adherents to this view?
</em><br />
<p>Well, you can never get completely rid of your past! And metaphysics 
<br />
(in Heidegger's sense of the separation between Subject/Object) is 
<br />
part of our Western past (and of scientific thinking). Think about 
<br />
the concept of 'representation' of an 'outside world' for instance, 
<br />
or about the constructivist idea, that everything is a construction 
<br />
of our brain (I call this 'cerebralism').
<br />
<p>2) Information and Language
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The possibility of saying (!) something is 'out there' is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;possibility given to us through language, as far as we can say: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;something 'is' (or 'is not'), and to broad-cast our 'casting'. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    This is exactly the point that has intrigued me. Our linguistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; institution seems to underlie the issue of information, instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply that information be something to adequately be represented 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a language.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>Yes! I have been reading these days Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker's 
<br />
ideas on the relationship between language and information 
<br />
(particularly his early essays in his book &quot;Die Einheit der Natur&quot;, 
<br />
that he continues to think in his later works). He connects the 
<br />
concept of information (in an objective sense) to the (Greek) concept 
<br />
of form. So he can speak of information and understanding (!) at a
<br />
biological level. But at the same time, the stresses the idea, that 
<br />
information is only given through (!) language, as far as language 
<br />
makes explicit the form ('eidos'/'idea') of that, which is. So there 
<br />
is a (hermeneutic) circle between language and information. It seems 
<br />
as if language, not beeing reduced to univocity, goes 'beyong' 
<br />
information, or, in other words, as we have the possibility of saying 
<br />
more that what we 'simply' can univocally say.
<br />
<p>3) Broadcasting messages
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As far as I can see, your question has also to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;do with two interesting subject matters: what does it mean to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;'broadcast' a message? We need, I think, something we could call a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;theory of messages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Rafael, you seem to imply here that the descriptive author of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any text on messages is willing to accept behavioral active agents 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surviving even within the text. Am I right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>I am not sure if I get your message now! I was trying to say, that 
<br />
our language has the basic structure of message, as it is directed 
<br />
towards somebody else. A text is not just something to be interpreted 
<br />
but primary a message that can be interpreted. We have had a theory 
<br />
of interpretation that does not take this pre-condition sufficiently 
<br />
into account. The reason for this is, in my opinion, that the concept 
<br />
(and the phenomenon) of message in our Greek tradition (the concept 
<br />
of 'angelia')was left aside by the powerful 'logos' of philosophy, 
<br />
that implied another structure for the distribution of what is being 
<br />
said ('angelia' was primarily a 'hierarchical' or 'vertical' and 
<br />
mythical structure). But this is a long story!
<br />
<p>4) Information and time:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;And the second point is, what does it mean to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;talk about information in the present tense and in the present 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;progressive tense. This last question concerns the relationship 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;between message transmission and time. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    How about the possibility that even time itself, whether global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or local, might be a human construct especially in the context of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;When talking about information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without making the (human) difference between past, present and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;future, we get a specific form of information (or message) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;transmission. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    You may have some idea of time here. Could you explicate it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a little bit more? Your view looks quite challenging.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>Weizsäcker is also concerned with the question of the relationship 
<br />
between information and time, from the point of view of quantum 
<br />
physics. He also knows from philosophy that the conception of time a 
<br />
a linear sequence of equal points does not take into account not only 
<br />
the problem of irreversibility, but also the kind of relationship we 
<br />
(!) have to time as tri-dimensional (or four-dimensional, as far as 
<br />
we can think the three dimensions: past, presen, future in their 
<br />
togetherness).
<br />
So much for today
<br />
