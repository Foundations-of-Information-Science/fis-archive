Dear FIS friends,
<br />
<p>Please, allow me to try to mix number theory as a style among the points
<br />
discussed presently. As Jerry points out:
<br />
<p>It appears to me that attempting to identify a common basis of
<br />
representation for communication among us requires ... an attempt to use 
<br />
language consistency.
<br />
<p>Maybe the language of numbers will be acceptable and suited to get to the
<br />
skeleton of what we try to express.
<br />
<p>Loet:
<br />
I do not understand what you mean by &quot;asymmetry&quot; in this context.
<br />
Perhaps you mean an ecological system?       I would not even guess
<br />
at what you are seeking to communicate with the term &quot;triple Helix
<br />
Dynamics&quot; unless this is a metaphor for a particular belief system.
<br />
Perhaps you are suggesting an intertwining of relations?
<br />
Symmetry appears as a mathematical concept if one renumbers the numbers 
<br />
according to their being made up of dissimilar units. Using the symmetrical 
<br />
property of logicl statements as an additional criterium of whether this 
<br />
statement is true, one finds differing heights of truth levels. Therefore, 
<br />
the concept of symmetry and asymmetry is indeed deeply intertwined in 
<br />
whatever logical, reasonable we say (about Nature).
<br />
<p>Rafael:
<br />
Based on your posts in May / June, I ask:  How can one include and
<br />
exclude terms in communicating about information?  If one is to
<br />
separate words into two classes, one related to information and one
<br />
not, then what is the boundary between the two classes?    After our
<br />
discussion in Baden-Baden, I wonder how you view the treed structures
<br />
of statements (Satz) from the basic  (Grund) structures.
<br />
There are dependencies of sentences. One can draw like family-trees of
<br />
logical statements (that are variations on one logical sentence). This also
<br />
without having to transform the language from sequence-based into
<br />
common-based representation or back. In the language itself there are
<br />
parents and dependents. If it specifies and individuates more than the
<br />
other, then this is the son, the other the parent.
<br />
The description of the sentence in a meta-communicational way happens by 
<br />
its translation into the other language. (Human brain can hardly separate 
<br />
the biochemical and the electrical components within thinking but we 
<br />
discuss the effects the interplay between feeling and thinking causes in us.)
<br />
<p>Heiner:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I admire the works of several economists, including Herman
<br />
Daly.  However, how is this philosophy of economics to be related to
<br />
natural principles?  What in you mind distinguishes intelligent
<br />
opinions from scientific information?  With effort, many posters to
<br />
this list serve can create plausible scenarios about our common
<br />
future.  What allows us to distinguish between pessimistic and
<br />
optimistic scenarios?
<br />
What logical set of syllogisms will tie these threads of ideas into a
<br />
persuasive picture?  The concept of Human Destiny?  How do you relate this 
<br />
concept to &quot;information&quot; or communication?
<br />
<p>Emotion and intelligence are intertwined in the brain like in a sponge
<br />
producing electrical impulses. It is the interplay between how the fluids
<br />
are made up and in what pattern the discharges happen. If one speaks 
<br />
exactly that what he feels then he generates for himself no information, 
<br />
tho for his surroundings he may have given communication.
<br />
What we talk about is the weather in our brain. We exchange feelings and
<br />
ideas about how
<br />
a) relative to how wet and humid the ground is how many or few lightnings
<br />
happen; or,
<br />
b) relative to how many lightnings are there, how barren and dry the ground
<br />
appears.
<br />
Information is how and in what one translation of the same sentence into 
<br />
the other language differs (an intraindividual evaluation), communication 
<br />
is the change in the oral (receiving, integrating, including) partner's
<br />
representation of the present as opposed to the remembered: this may be
<br />
caused by an anal (sending, discharging, excluding) partner in the
<br />
communication.
<br />
<p>Pedro:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are correct in picturing a bifurcation between the
<br />
individual and the population.  In purely mathematical terms, there
<br />
is a syllogistic separation.  In another sense, if it takes a village
<br />
to raise a child, does it take a society to heal a patient?  My point
<br />
is that the mathematical usage creates a complete separation between
<br />
the component and the assembly while the biological and social usage
<br />
sustains a relation between the component and the assembly.
<br />
<p>Set theory tries to deal with the individual and the whole. Usually,
<br />
marketing, sociology and statistics (and games and programming, etc.) try 
<br />
to find a focus in the middle between unit and collection. Agglomerational,
<br />
granulational questions are not that easy to formalise because they do have 
<br />
emotional connotations. The chi-square distribution is quite useful in
<br />
discussing expected densities of (combinations of) properties on
<br />
individuals. The field is wide open for a good theory for an averagely
<br />
structured assembly.
<br />
<p>Luis:
<br />
I continue to think about your questions but have not a clear vision
<br />
of what you are asking.  Is a concealed component of your question a
<br />
desire to apply the MKS system of coherent measurements across all of
<br />
nature?  What is your view of &quot;units&quot; such that the commonality of
<br />
mathematical operations is preserved? How can we be assured that
<br />
local relations are extensible to global relations?
<br />
<p>Indeed, if one could come up with a good interface between biological and
<br />
mechanical, that would be an interesting proposal, isn't it. There are some
<br />
currents saying that this is possible. Then one would understand biology
<br />
like one understands navigation. As a unit they propose &quot;matches&quot; or
<br />
&quot;congruences&quot; between logical statements, because these are by far not
<br />
infinite (although quite a lot). These matches even translate into a more
<br />
solid presence, as the proponents of this approach calculate the average
<br />
number of logical relations per object and re-extrapolate how many objects
<br />
are there if the logical space is that dense.
<br />
This schmuck little invention of renumbering 1:0, 2:-1, 3:0, 4:+1; 5:-1, 6:0,
<br />
7:+1; 8:-2, 9:-1, .... is of a huge practical value. One can transport form
<br />
sentences over sizes by just sending the m-equivalents. In fact, this is the
<br />
technique of meta-communication.
<br />
<p>I do hope that by this re-rendering of what I understood to be the status of
<br />
the discussion, there appear more possibilities to explain to each other
<br />
what we have in mind.
<br />
<p>Best wishes
<br />
Karl
