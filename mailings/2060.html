                <p>A plant is paying the bee with sugar to disperse the pollen. A potato is
                    <br />
                    paying humans with carbohydrates to disperse the plant. A cherry tree
                    <br />
                    pays the bee first for doing the matchmaking, and the bird later for
                    <br />
                    doing the child-rearing. Lice pay the ants to guard them. Plants release
                    <br />
                    distress signals when attacked by lice to call the predators. Flowers
                    <br />
                    smell and look good so that the bees don't need to think that much to
                    <br />
                    find them (how strange that we like what the bees like?). When I go for
                    <br />
                    a walk around the bushes, I am saddened to see the prickly dog rose
                    <br />
                    plants loaded with the rotting red fruit that the birds no longer &quot;buy&quot;

                    (they prefer sunflower seeds). Food is money: ATP is cash, glucose is
                    <br />
                    bonds, fat is property.
                    <br />
                <p>As a human, I don't feel that our monetary economics is *that*
                    <br />
                    special... It just operates on a higher level, but there is nothing
                    <br />
                    conceptually different, if you allow for the inter-level
                    <br />
                    self-similarity. The message of entropy and energy is that essentially
                    <br />
                    the same descriptors can be applied to any level. We are not being
                    <br />
                    reductionists reducing information to joules and degrees centigrade.
                    <br />
                    Instead, we're thinking on what corresponds to &quot;joules&quot; and &quot;degrees
                    <br />
                    centigrade&quot; at the information level.
                    <br />
                <p>When you spend energy, you pay. When you obtain energy, you are paid. We
                    <br />
                    are all paid here by the Sun to do something. We, humans, are paid to
                    <br />
                    maintain an ecosystem of symbols and thoughts, not to generate entropy.
                    <br />
                    Anyone who's talking here is selling ideas, and those who are listening
                    <br />
                    are buying them. As long as there are sellers and buyers and profit for
                    <br />
                    both, the forum exists.
                    <br />
                <p>There is a distinct tendency for ideas to disperse. Eventually, each of
                    <br />
                    us might know everything. There will no longer be a gradient, and there
                    <br />
                    will no longer be trade. That's when the entropy will win, and that's
                    <br />
                    when it will be the death of the forum.
                    <br />
                <p>Both selling and buying of ideas, even listening to them involves
                    <br />
                    spending energy at the lower level (our breakfasts). When there will no
                    <br />
                    longer be bread that can be used for thinking, the ideas and the medium
                    <br />
                    in which they dwell (us), both of them will be gone.
                    <br />
                <p>The ideas can consume their owners (suicide cults, self-sacrifice,
                    <br />
                    workaholism, university education), and the ideas can make their owners
                    <br />
                    multiply (Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of
                    <br />
                    all flesh, including birds, cattle, and every creeping thing that creeps
                    <br />
                    on the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be
                    <br />
                    fruitful, and multiply on the earth.ï¿½)
                    <br />
                <p>Culture is an ecosystem that maintains and nurtures a particular set of
                    <br />
                    ideas and values (is it prolific, is it sustainable?). Knowledge is
                    <br />
                    granary of ideas (will you ever eat it, or will it rot? does all the
                    <br />
                    knowledge make us obese? will anyone buy it?)

                    </em><br />
                <p>Let me try: Computation is a set of constraints you place on the flow of
                    <br />
                    energy. Some computations reinforce the flow in an autocatalytic fashion
                    <br />
                    (software you want to buy; the software that thus gets reproduced, like
                    <br />
                    we let good potatoes reproduce), others just produce entropy (&quot;10 goto
                    <br />
                    10&quot; that makes your computer suck electricity and pump hot air out from
                    <br />
                    itself). Viruses and worms are selfish autocatalytic loops, and we pay
                    <br />
                    for antivirus software to get rid of them, just like we have to pay for
                    <br />
                    the immune systems in our bodies. Operating systems are
                    <br />
                    centrally-managed artificial ecosystems that maintain order and allocate
                    <br />
                    resources. Etc.
