<p>Well I for one believe in women. Certainly some women can be vicious, and 
<br />
certainly some men can be loving, BUT men are not known for being 
<br />
nurturing. I think that the few or many or even most of the women who have 
<br />
the characteristics that men are famous for acquired them by trying to 
<br />
emulate man. Perhaps they have a sense of insecurity which drives them to 
<br />
constantly prove themselves. Perhaps this is shared by men alike. But not 
<br />
all people are insecure. Woman are known for running a family, an 
<br />
integrative affair to say the least. When men try that they usually are the 
<br />
brunt of jokes. I don't know about genes, I do know there are different 
<br />
genes in women than men, I don't know if that is sexist or even racist. 
<br />
Male and female go back quite a way, and it is not easy to determine what 
<br />
the original purpose was. I think that a large part of the problems we face 
<br />
today are the result of corruption. And further that this corruption is 
<br />
ubiquitous and even further the corrupt form a conspiracy
<br />
of association. In the scientific sense, it has been shown time and time 
<br />
again that women think differently than men. Not all women. But for the 
<br />
most part, women do not have the superior ego than men have. This ego does 
<br />
in fact translate into a different kind of person. The way I look at it, 
<br />
the male mind has the ego in control while in most women it is the 
<br />
intuition that rules. The thinking is different because in one the goal is 
<br />
separation while in the other the goal is bringing together. Perhaps if the 
<br />
world were run by honest men, we would not have to think about who could do 
<br />
better. Will it be any different if dishonest women gain control? Probably 
<br />
not. But I can remember a time when the current joke was about how a 
<br />
certain politician was on the take. The joke has been twisted around 
<br />
nowadays into &quot;who isn't on the take?&quot; But that ain't no joke. We live in a 
<br />
time when the world is being run by sick people. And anyone trying to 
<br />
change that has my support.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I've been getting the same post, on 'women saving the world' from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of sources. I find it quite offensive. Why? Because it's naive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reductionist, filled with false data, illogical ungrounded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclusions - and - racist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;False assumptions - that women are innately good, nurturing and etc,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when hard data shows that women are just as capable as men of hatred,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ignorance, jealously, malice and violence. False assumptions - that IF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;women were in charge, THEN, all would be good and peaceful. False
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption - that women are 'good and peaceful' due to some genetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characteristic lacking in men. Sounds racist to me - the attribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a behavioural characteristic grounded in genetic causality. So -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;men are genetically unable to generate peace? Prove it. And prove the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opposite- that women are genetically bonded to peace. False data -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that women do 2/3  of the work. False assumptions - of 'mind over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter' - assuming that all it takes is 'goodwill' to deal with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ecological, economic and educational disparities of the world. False
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumptions - that men have no desire to do so. These type of post are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evangelistic, advocacy rants. Not open to proof, to debate, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dialogue.
