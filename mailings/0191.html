<p>
I will try to present a possible Cultural Anthropology (CA)
<br />
perspective with respect to the current fis socio info discussion. 
<br />
<p>issue: the base of discourse
<br />
============================
<br />
IMO, when seeking to apply {biological /darwinian} metaphors 
<br />
for socio information we should be more aware that 
<br />
all scientific discourse is taking place on the social plane, 
<br />
(even without invoking Feyerabend), and it is primarily
<br />
governed by the social communications processes that
<br />
we humans use implicitly and without much reflection 
<br />
all the time, in order to make ourselves (more or less) 
<br />
understood by our peers.
<br />
<p>issue: Lamarckism / Genes / Memes / Weismann Barrier
<br />
=====================================================
<br />
IMO, Lamarckism vs. Darwinism is an issue of the Weismann Barrier,
<br />
i.e. by current scholarly consensus, ontogenetic information 
<br />
cannot pass with genes to the next generation.
<br />
To speak of Lamarckism in issues other than biological 
<br />
inheritance runs the danger of overstressing the metaphor.
<br />
socio info is about NOTHING ELSE than the transmission
<br />
of ontogenetic information. What is transmitted by
<br />
phylogenetic means (genes) is conversely an issue of genetics.
<br />
<p>We should note, though, that the Weismann Barrier does
<br />
not apply to (prokaryote) bacteria, since these can trade and swap
<br />
genetic information freely. See Howard Bloom's contribution
<br />
with his bacterial &quot;global brain&quot; concept. (also Margulis &amp; Sagan)
<br />
Therefore, the info lives of bacteria can possibly 
<br />
be used much more readily as models for socio info than
<br />
the eukaryote model.

<br />
(so to say: the www existed already in the pre-cambrium age). 
<br />
This may also be an insteresting connection to 
<br />
Tom Stonier's &quot;Global Brain&quot; concept.

<p><p>issue: Social Information, &quot;individual humans&quot; vs. &quot;society&quot; 
<br />
Tue, 27 Oct 1998 22:42:13 -0100 (GMT-0100)
<br />
Bob Artigiani &lt;artigian&#64;novell.nadn.navy.mil&gt;
<br />
and other contributions by Bob. (Royal Road...)
<br />
===================================================
<br />
In the CA perspective, the distinctions introducted
<br />
between &quot;individual humans&quot; and  &quot;society&quot; seem
<br />
artificially abstract and quite impossible in &quot;life out there&quot;
<br />
There is no such thing as an isolated &quot;individual human&quot;. 
<br />
(No man is an island). Therefore there is also no possibility that 
<br />
&quot;the individual humans will return to their initial state&quot;, 
<br />
because there never was one. (I believe that this error was
<br />
introduced by Rousseau, or was it Hobbes, with his &quot;short and
<br />
brutish life of primitive man&quot;)?
<br />
One writer (I believe it was Sahlins)
<br />
once said that the beginnings of humanity were most like 
<br />
&quot;a two-million year continuous encounter group&quot;, for the 
<br />
density of social interaction that took place. Current CA
<br />
accounts of hunter-gatherer tribes (like the Bushmen and 
<br />
the Australian Aborigines) corroborate this. (Sahlins)
<br />
<p><p>issue: social vs. natural environment 
<br />
=====================================
<br />
The distinction between the &quot;environment of society&quot; and
<br />
the &quot;natural environment&quot; likewise seems
<br />
artificially abstract if not downright impossible.
<br />
We may, to the contrary, consider most of the effort of 
<br />
ecology to formulate the &quot;society view&quot; of a natural ecosystem.
<br />
A good example for this would be:
<br />
Robert Ulanowicz: &quot;Ecology, the Ascendent Perspective&quot;
<br />
Columbia Univ. Press 1996. ulan&#64;cbl.cees.edu
<br />
Ulanovicz describes an &quot;Information Theory in Ecology&quot; 
<br />
in Ch. 4. that should be quite appropriate for the present
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<p>I refer again to the theoretical groundwork given by 
<br />
Whitehead in &quot;Process and Reality&quot;
<br />
and my email: on social complexity

<br />
<p><p>issue: VEMs vs. rites &amp; rituals
<br />
===============================
<br />
The same with VEMs vs. rites &amp; rituals. 
<br />
For this, a nice CA anecdote will be illustrative:
<br />
At one time the Indonesian government finally wanted to 
<br />
&quot;help&quot; the backwards superstitious Balinese farmers who 
<br />
were still letting their planting and harvesting cycles 
<br />
be determined by the Brahmin priests and their ritual 
<br />
calendar with all their &quot;superfluous&quot; festivities, 
<br />
and they called in some &quot;real&quot; and &quot;rational&quot; agronomic
<br />
specialists. The result was complete catastrophe. The
<br />
crops rotted in the fields and the pests ate what
<br />
was left of them. 
<br />
<p>Perhaps the ritual calendar embodied
<br />
some vital knowledge of mainly ecological issues
<br />
that the agronomists were entirely oblivious of. Animist
<br />
conceptions consider all of nature as animate, and therefore
<br />
communicable. What else but a society view of the world is this?
<br />
<p><p>issue: REPRODUCING vs. REPLICATING and the cultural memory
<br />
==========================================================
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bob Artigiani Tue, 27 Oct 1998 22:42:13: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;because every now and a great then some real deviation occurs&quot; 
</em><br />
In this matter, the dictum:
<br />
&quot;le plus ça change, le plus ça reste le même&quot; applies
<br />
strictly. Since most of the social development takes more than
<br />
one human's life span to come about, we must be aware, 
<br />
that our facility to notice change or continuity, is
<br />
also the same what we experience as change(d) or constant. 
<br />
This is a matter of the cultural memory. 
<br />
And it is controlled by certain cultural facilities such as 
<br />
writing or performative (oral) tradition. On this footing,
<br />
there are some slowly changing parameters in society, 
<br />
like language, VEMs, and &quot;rites &amp; rituals&quot;. Others are
<br />
changing faster, like fads, styles, attitudes, etc. But
<br />
there is no such thing as a clear (or &quot;natural&quot;) 
<br />
(or Weismann) distinction between the things changing, 
<br />
and those remaining constant. To introduce this distinction 
<br />
is strictly in the eye of the observer, or a matter
<br />
of the social consensus, which brings us back to the beginning.
<br />
<p><p>Conclusion: a more general substrate 
<br />
====================================
<br />
(See also: Stockinger, Wed, 28 Oct 1998)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;So we have to look, as you say, for new media...&quot; 
</em><br />
<p>It would be appropriate to consider, in an ecological manner, 
<br />
the whole living biosphere as &quot;a kind of&quot; society (see Whitehead).
<br />
also Stan Salthe:
<br />
(Evolving hierarchical systems, Columbia Univ. Press, New York (1985)
<br />
Science as the basis for a new mythological understanding, Uroboros, No.
<br />
1, 25-45. (1992)
<br />
Development and evolution, MIT Press, Cambridge (1993))
<br />
<p>We should therefore look for a more general substrate underlying
<br />
VEMs as well as &quot;rites &amp; rituals&quot;, the &quot;matter of
<br />
INFORMATION and its COMMUNICATION&quot; (Stockinger, Wed, 28 Oct 1998)
<br />
that is not subsumable by or commensurable with 
<br />
Darwinian (genetic) discourse. We would have to take a hard look 
<br />
into fashioning &quot;new media&quot; from a repertoire of 
<br />
&quot;close {neuronal/chemical/vibrational/behavioral} coupling&quot; 
<br />
of organisms that is only on the very highest levels 
<br />
reflected by the symbolic strata that we humans have evolved, 
<br />
and of which our western european-derived 
<br />
alphabetic/mathematical/etc./ symbol repertoire is again a very
<br />
narrow sample.
