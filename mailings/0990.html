<p>
Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>Let me arbitrarily choose a couple of aspects among the exciting 'musical 
<br />
landscapes' just popped out from our Pandora discussion box.
<br />
<p>The connection of music with DNA --by Sergei-- is really intriguing. It 
<br />
anticipates themes of the molecular patterns discussion that we will have 
<br />
after the current one. I think that the proposal of a genomic music has 
<br />
already been explored by several researchers and composers ---unfortunately 
<br />
in a more superficial way than the binary sub-codes he proposes (although I 
<br />
have never heard that new DNA music, seemingly there is a commercial CD 
<br />
just available). About the overall harmony connecting that genomic music 
<br />
with physiological and archetypal aspects, it looks rather baseless for my 
<br />
taste... Well, I am these days re-reading Thomas Mann (his 'Mountain'), and 
<br />
have found several disgressions on life, science, humanities, music, etc., 
<br />
that look pertinent to our present discussions: particularly our reverence 
<br />
for the 'formal' aesthetic aspects. That criticism is addressed --at least 
<br />
so I interpret it-- towards the Pythagorean-Anthropocentric veneer so much 
<br />
dominating entire territories of Western science and humanities. Pinch of 
<br />
salt added, I would apply that criticism, in different ways, to the second 
<br />
half of Sergei's mesage (pythagorean) and to several paragraphs of Juan's 
<br />
response to me days ago (anthropocentric)...
<br />
<p>Is music an exclusively human phenomenon? First language, then music would 
<br />
accompany to support in emotional manifestations...  However the apparent 
<br />
coherence of this anthropocentric view (I do not deny that, together with 
<br />
the ad hoc definition of attributes Juan proposes, it looks consistent) 
<br />
there is a new emergent field known as 'biomusicology' or 'evolutionary 
<br />
musicology'  where a bunch of interdisciplinary scholars are trying to make 
<br />
biological sense of the 'human' phenomenon of music. Indeed I take their 
<br />
part: see &quot;The Origins of Music&quot; by Wallin, Merker &amp; Brown (eds.) MIT Press 
<br />
2000. (among other illustrious contributors: Freeman, Jerison, Bickerton, 
<br />
Falk, etc.)
<br />
<p>The discussion on avian singing --and brains--- is too complex for being 
<br />
addressed here. However, there would be intriguing parallels in the 
<br />
mammalian groups and genera were genuine forms of music or quasi-music 
<br />
exist: dolphins, whales, orangutans, chimps --Bonovo--, homo (highest 
<br />
encephalization rate, big social groups, niche communicational strictures, 
<br />
courtship sophisticated behavior). Recently it has been found, for 
<br />
instance, that whales indulge on fashions and fads about their cultural 
<br />
repertoire of songs...  foreign males introducing new songs are 'adored' 
<br />
and rewarded by females (courtship is a crucial playground for all musical 
<br />
manifestations, in the human case too).
<br />
<p>In the above book, Dean Falk was suggesting a 'truce' to the evolutionary 
<br />
and to the anthropocentric champions on the origins of music. The idea is 
<br />
that in the neurological evolution of Anthropoids a vast information 
<br />
processing system is progressively configured about the analysis of 
<br />
sonorous landscapes, implying the interplay of two dominant modes 
<br />
(lateralization): a 'Learning Channnel'  dealing with protolinguistics, and 
<br />
a 'MTV Channel' dealing with the emotional holistics (music). As he says, 
<br />
it finally revolves on the information processing of &quot;sequences versus 
<br />
simultaneity&quot;... (clearly one is reminded about Karl's motto).
<br />
<p>Although I accept that at FIS we may 'seat' on the above consensus place 
<br />
about the origins of music, I am still uncomfortable. It is about the 
<br />
treatment of emotions. In the neurosciences they are almost universally 
<br />
conceived as a 'leftover' of the phenomenon of learning and particularly of 
<br />
the conceptual human capabilities. (Reverence to language--but it also 
<br />
relates to the strict conception of 'logic' that was mentioned by Ted). 
<br />
Most  classifications of emotions are just pathetic and even an offense to 
<br />
scientific intelligence... hopefully there is some revival and progress in 
<br />
the theme, mostly related to consciousness (Damasio, Ledoux, Edelman). My 
<br />
own interest on music, and particularly on laughter, is that these holistic 
<br />
sonorous phenomena provide an intriguing place to handle emotions in a new, 
<br />
neatly 'informational' way, were abstract patterns and deep emotional 
<br />
reactions directly shake hands (without 'meaning' intermediation), trying 
<br />
to go beyond the rather frustrating approach initiated by Rosalin Picard in 
<br />
her 'Affective Computing' book.
<br />
<p>So having clarified my evolutionary discrepancies with Juan (and perhaps 
<br />
also with Michael) concerning the Origins of Music, I am much excited 
<br />
waiting for their discussions on the formal aspects of music. Cleanly 
<br />
identifying the abstract patterns of music (the 'essentic forms'?--M. 
<br />
Clynes) that call into action our emotional powers I think is crucial for 
<br />
the new relation intelligence-emotions that we have to promote at FIS.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
