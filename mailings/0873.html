<p>
December 30th of 2002 as a date is quite near to the end of one year 
<br />
that has motivated several minds to CELEBRATE its disappearance from 
<br />
the present and its insertion forever in the past. This feeling has 
<br />
arisen due to many dramatically inconsistent and incoherent 
<br />
arguments, expressed through pretended clever reasoning, that aim at 
<br />
encouraging people - the highly civilized fellows and the masses - to 
<br />
maintain the unsustainable trends of our magnificent civilization. 
<br />
This celebration seems to be justified in the hope that the year 2003 
<br />
will become spontaneously the time for changing deeply rooted 
<br />
barbarian, therefore inhuman, intentions into really enlightened 
<br />
aims, therefore humane ones. Such assumption is in fact a childish 
<br />
reaction, but even most dissidents, nonconformists, rebels and 
<br />
heretics have been educated to believe in the emergence of renewed 
<br />
light every new year, refusing de facto to recognize that any 
<br />
calendar as a conventional arrangement would not contain magical 
<br />
power.
<br />
<p>Anyhow I have chosen to celebrate the end of 2002 after recognizing 
<br />
that it is urgently needed to comprehend sufficiently well what makes 
<br />
unsustainable our civilized way of life. For making feasible this 
<br />
requirement is indispensable to use explicitly the Bertalanffy's Top 
<br />
Ë Down approach in order to identify the causality of the problematic 
<br />
civilization through the perception of one or another of its features 
<br />
as a gestalt or a whole. I dare to choose DEMOCRACY as a problem.
<br />
<p>Lewis Mumford quoted in 1944 a reflection of Henry Adams written in 
<br />
1905: &quot;At the present rate of progression since 1600, it will not 
<br />
need another century or half century to tip thought upside down.  Law 
<br />
in that case, would disappear as theory or a priori principle and 
<br />
give place to force. Morality would become police.  Explosives would 
<br />
reach cosmic violence. Disintegration would overcome integration.&quot; 
<br />
Adams was certainly against the dogmatic way most of their 
<br />
contemporaries were implementing Democracy, as it had become a weapon 
<br />
for manipulating the mind of common people in order to lead them to 
<br />
believe that their interests and motivations had been taken into 
<br />
account.
<br />
<p>The democratic principle, that arose first as a conceptual tool, had 
<br />
been adopted several centuries before for the election of the Pope in 
<br />
order to temper the evils of absolutism and to fight against the 
<br />
weakness of nepotism. Gradually and even consistently the democratic 
<br />
procedures were developed for making functional the operation of 
<br />
communities and cities, under the assumption that to govern 
<br />
rationally any human organization becomes a feasible task through 
<br />
cooperation and consent. However, at the same time other humans 
<br />
cleverly chose to learn and develop deeply and extensively the 
<br />
Machiavelli's ideals in order to make effective to govern by means of 
<br />
force, terrorism and corruption.
<br />
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century the democratic principles 
<br />
had assimilated well the Calvin's doctrine which claimed that 
<br />
citizens were equal on Earth as well as their souls in Heaven. The 
<br />
ancient aristocracies and monarchies were substituted by the 
<br />
democratic election of Machiavelli's disciples who required only to 
<br />
be explicitly empowered by the enthusiastic participation of those 
<br />
masses who were learning well to be conducted, instructed and tamed 
<br />
by civilized means.
<br />
<p>Henry Adams recognized the degradation of Democracy, though mainly 
<br />
intuitively, when he argued &quot;Bombs educate vigorously&quot;. He did not 
<br />
know neither fascism as generalized controller nor national socialism 
<br />
for fighting against the dictatorial socialism which became soon 
<br />
fallacious alternatives, though they were influenced as well by 
<br />
Machiavellian ideals.
<br />
<p>&quot;Adams knew that the detonators of violence and destruction were 
<br />
present in every part of the social structure of the Western society&quot; 
<br />
(Mumford). He did not dare to imagine that it could be saved. He 
<br />
neither theorize that 100 years later Charitable Corporations - 
<br />
emerging spontaneously - would engage themselves in organizing 
<br />
Compassionate Warfare using economic, social, cultural and only 
<br />
exceptionally traditional weapons for fighting against the evil 
<br />
enemies of highly civilized humans. Nor could he recognize the 
<br />
tremendous advancement of Science for increasing ad infinitum the 
<br />
number of technological facilities. Those required for an exhaustive 
<br />
exploitation of natural resources in order to produce everything, 
<br />
anything and nothing needed by everybody, anybody and nobody for 
<br />
going everywhere, anywhere and nowhere, being excepted those 
<br />
individuals who are always complaining and should be eliminated by 
<br />
humanitarian procedures and be substituted afterwards, if necessary, 
<br />
by a generalized Automation.
