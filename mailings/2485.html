Dear Michael,
<br />
I am not sure whether I understand your question correctly, 
<br />
so I can agree conditionally with part of it, but not with 
<br />
all what you have written. Actually, I do not object the 
<br />
statements from the latter part, but I do not understand it 
<br />
well. 
<br />
You wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's my understanding that the quantum wavefunction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corresponds, one to one, with the state vector in Hilbert 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space. 
</em><br />
Please do not think that I am a maniac of precision, but I 
<br />
would restate it as follows. For one wave function and one 
<br />
vector the statement of one-to-one correspondence is not 
<br />
clear to me. 
<br />
&quot;The set of wave functions corresponds, one to one, with the 
<br />
state vectors (vectors of norm 1) of a Hilbert space.&quot;
<br />
<p>This sentence is a tautology (necessarily true) from the 
<br />
point of view of the Hilbert space formalism, or somebody 
<br />
who accepts it. More specifically, wave functions can be 
<br />
identified with  elements of the specific representation of 
<br />
the general Hilbert space as a Hilbert space of square-
<br />
integrable complex functions, distinguished by the condition 
<br />
that their norms are equal one. We can have representations 
<br />
using functions of position or functions of momentum giving 
<br />
different Hilbert spaces. 
<br />
But not everybody has to accept the Hilbert space formalism.
<br />
<p>DIGGRESSION:  The problem within this formalism (I wrote 
<br />
about it before) is that there are infinitely many fifferent 
<br />
wave functions, or if you prefere vectors, which describe 
<br />
the same state. They differ by a complex factor of modulus 
<br />
1, so typically (especially in practical applications) this 
<br />
violation of one-to-one correspondence between the states 
<br />
and vectors is ignored.  
<br />
<p>CONTINUATION: My first answer was conditional. Those who 
<br />
accept Hilbert space formalism, would agree. But what about 
<br />
those who do not?  
<br />
I am not sure what assumptions you have made about &quot;quantum 
<br />
wavefunctions&quot;. If you assume that :
<br />
a) wave functions have to be square integrable complex 
<br />
functions,
<br />
b) for a function to be a wave function is not necessary to 
<br />
be a state of any specific physical system,
<br />
then the correspondence is clearly one-to-one. 
<br />
<p>However, if these assumptions are not made, two questions 
<br />
may arise. 
<br />
Question 1: 
<br />
- Can every quantum state be represented this way? 
<br />
For instance, those who think interms of wave functions 
<br />
without the context of Hilbert space could argue that free 
<br />
particle should be described by a function with infinite 
<br />
norm (or no norm). 
<br />
But there is additional problem. If you assume that physical 
<br />
system can have only states described by wave functions, you 
<br />
eliminate possibility of the state which is not &quot;pure state&quot; 
<br />
(in terms of quantum logic which I presented briefly, you 
<br />
assume that systems are purely quantum systems, where in 
<br />
reality in most of cases we deal with systems which are only 
<br />
partially quantum systems. Yes mixtures (as opposed to 
<br />
superpositions) are incorporated into the picture in an 
<br />
articial way which from the mathematical point of view is 
<br />
questionable.
<br />
<p>Question 2:
<br />
- Is every wave function a state of some physical system?
<br />
I do not think it is possible to prove or disprove this 
<br />
statement. It is a matter of assumption. (I may be wrong in 
<br />
this point. I can imagine that some smart reasoning could be 
<br />
used to find example of a wave function for which there is 
<br />
no possible physical model. But I do not remember meeting 
<br />
with any such convincing reasoning)
<br />
<p>If you ask for my own view, as I wrote before, both the 
<br />
description refering to wave functions as phenomenological 
<br />
tools without any specific mathematical theoretical 
<br />
formalism and the Hilbert space formalism are for me too 
<br />
narrow to give correct description of the physical reality. 
<br />
Thus, you ask: do you agree that A is the same as B. My 
<br />
answer (yes, under some conditions...) does not endorse 
<br />
either of the approaches. In my opinion only approach of the 
<br />
level of generality provided by quantum logic gives us full 
<br />
picture. 
<br />
<p>It is more difficult to me to respond to your second 
<br />
question, or second part of your question. It could be a 
<br />
result of my limited knowledge, or a matter of very concise 
<br />
form of your question, but I cannot understand it well.  
<br />
You wrote: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The spatial representation of the wavefunction, Psi(x), for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example, is identical with the inner product, in Hilbert 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space, of the position eigenvector for x with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state vector, a. Or the momentum representation of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wavefunction, Psi(p), is identical to the inner product of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the momentum eigenvector, p, with the state vector, a.
</em><br />
<p>What I understand (not necessarily correctly) you are 
<br />
writing that for given state &quot;a&quot; (represented as a vector in 
<br />
Hilbert space) we can produce a wave function in position 
<br />
space (or wave function as a function of the variable x 
<br />
representing position) as the result of Hilbert space inner 
<br />
product of the vector &quot;a&quot; and &quot;the position eigenvector for 
<br />
x&quot;. 
<br />
The last part I do not understand, possibly because it is 
<br />
without any context. When you write &quot;the position 
<br />
eigenvector for x&quot; you apparently assume that there is one 
<br />
particular eigenvector for observable x. But there is no 
<br />
such unique eigenvector. Thus, you must have some way to 
<br />
identify which one you want to use. I do not know which 
<br />
eigenvector you wanted to choose, so it is difficult for me 
<br />
to say definitely &quot;I do not agree.&quot; I can only say that I do 
<br />
not understand, and I am afraid there is something important 
<br />
missing in your construction. 
<br />
Additional problem is that the Hilbert space does not have 
<br />
to be Hilbert space of complex functions defined for 
<br />
positions, or worse it does not have to be Hilbert space of 
<br />
functions at all. 
<br />
But, it odoes not make sense to multiply possible 
<br />
difficulties, when I should answer simply that I do not 
<br />
understand the question.
<br />
Also, unfortunately, I do not have any of my books related 
<br />
to quantum mechanics with me here in Japan. So, I can not 
<br />
look it up in Merzbacher.
<br />
Sorry for not being able to give you more definite answer. 
<br />
Regards,
<br />
Marcin

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Marcin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Its my understanding that the quantum wavefunction 
</em><br />
corresponds, one to 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one, with the state vector in Hilbert space. The spatial 
</em><br />
representation 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the wavefunction, Psi(x), for example, is identical with 
</em><br />
the inner 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;product, in Hilbert space, of the position eigenvector for 
</em><br />
x with the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state vector, a. Or the momentum representation of the 
</em><br />
wavefunction, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Psi(p), is identical to the inner product of the momentum 
</em><br />
eigenvector, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;p, with the state vector, a. And so on. My authority for 
</em><br />
this is 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Merzbachers textbook. Would you disagree?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
