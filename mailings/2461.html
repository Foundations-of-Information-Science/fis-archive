&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Aleks,
<br />
<p>On one hand I like very much your example and discussion, but on the
<br />
other hand I do not think that your example can be used to illustrate
<br />
the situation with Bell´s inequality. 
<br />
<p>Aleks:&gt; Bell\'s formulation implies that the hidden variable is
<br />
independent of&gt; the configuration of the detectors. On the other hand,
<br />
if we allow &gt; for  &gt; the fact that the hidden variable is dependent on
<br />
the mutual  &gt; configuration, then there is no need to abandon the
<br />
classical&gt; framework.
<br />
Andrei:I completely agree with this viewpoint.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To some extent this does imply some sort of non-locality. But it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &gt; same type of non-locality as in a perfectly classical context.
</em><br />
Let me&gt; describe an experiment.
<br />
Andrei: I completely agree with this viewpoint.
<br />
<p><p>Andrei: But regarding the experiment  -- see my comment after your
<br />
description of the experiment.
<br />
<p>Aleks:&gt; Imagine a bathtub. Imagine primitive measurement technology that 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involves putting person A in the water so that his nose is aligned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the water. He is measuring the incoming waves, and outputs 1 when a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; splashes into his eyes, and 0 otherwise. There is another person B 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measuring in the same way on the other side of the bathtub. You can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change the orientation of both people, and this will clearly affect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frequency of water splashing into their eyes. Now throw a stone in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &gt; bathtub, creating an entangled pair of wavefronts propagating in
</em><br />
both&gt; &gt; directions. Measure the correlation of splashes into person A\'s
<br />
eyes&gt; and &gt; person B\'s eyes.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are three interpretations of the resulting correlations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; splashes:&gt; *
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;(QM) The waves are in a superposition of splashing and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not-splashing, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until person A experiences a splash or not-splash, and collapses the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave function. The collapse telepathically \&quot;informs-at-a-distance\&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &gt; other entangled wavefront whether person B will experience a
</em><br />
splash&gt; or not.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * (New Age) The two detectors are not independent - they are an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entangled pair in the aether of global consciousness, with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incredible ability of transmitting thoughts at a distance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * (classical) The fact that two people are in a bathtub with their&gt;
</em><br />
big &gt; measuring apparatuses (bodies, noses and eyes) will affect the
<br />
joint &gt; distribution of splashes. The position of one person will affect
<br />
the &gt; measurements experienced by the other person, because it affects
<br />
the &gt; shape of the body of water in which the wavefronts propagate.
<br />
<p>Andrei: Unfortunately, you would not be able to violate Bell\'s
<br />
inequality in this way. Although you use waves, these are classical
<br />
waves. The crucial difference between the classical wave mechanics and
<br />
quantum wave mechanics is that the system of two classical waves is
<br />
still described by the wave on the same three dimensional physical
<br />
space, but in the quantum case (and this was first time emphasized by
<br />
Schrodinger) the corresponding equation for the the system of two
<br />
quantum waves, &lt;&lt;quantum particles&gt;&gt;, is written on the R^6 and not on
<br />
the physical space R^3. Essentially this is responsible for a special 
<br />
quantum correlations and the violation of Bell\'s inequality. So if you
<br />
like the source of nonlocality is already in Schrodinger equation.
<br />
Therefore I am not much excited by the Bell inequality. 
<br />
<p>However, one may say: well we have a rather strange description of
<br />
quantum waves-particles, namely, by using the tensor product of Hilbert
<br />
spaces to describe composite systems, but it may be, nevertheless, a
<br />
purely classical and local model behind this? Of course, Bell would say
<br />
you: not at all.
<br />
<p>But I say: it seems yes. And here I would like to follow precisely your
<br />
argument:&gt;if we allow &gt; for  &gt; the fact that the hidden variable is
<br />
dependent on the mutual  &gt; configuration, then there is no need to
<br />
abandon the classical&gt; framework.
<br />
<p>There is one thing that couple both detectors. This is nothing else than
<br />
time. In all experiments there is such a thing as  TIME WINDOW and 
<br />
experimenter identify two clicks as belonging to an entangled pair 
<br />
if these clicks are inside the time window. There is no other way to
<br />
identify a pair. We do not know times of emissions from the cristal.
<br />
Moreover, particles (considered as entangled and belonging to the same
<br />
pair) can be emited by different atoms. 
<br />
<p>This time window couple two detectors or I would like to say determine 
<br />
unification of two local contexts of measurements. If there are two
<br />
fixed orientations A and B in lab1 and lab2, respectively, then by using
<br />
the time window we identify a special series of clicks in labs, so we
<br />
extract a special ensemble S_AB of particles. If we choose another
<br />
orientations, say C and D, then through the time window we shall get
<br />
another ensemble S_CD. If the situation is really such and ensembles are
<br />
really statistically different, then this gives us purely classical
<br />
explanation of the violation of Bell\'s inequality. However, it is common
<br />
to say that S_AB has the same statistical properties as S_CD. This is so
<br />
called FAIR SAMPLING ASSUMPTION. I thing it is not justified, see
<br />
<a href="../../www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309010">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309010</a>
<br />
[Experimental Scheme to Test the Fair Sampling Assumption in EPR-Bell
<br />
Experiments]
<br />
<p>The main problem for me: to find such a dependence of statistics on
<br />
experimental settings in other domains of science.  May be somebody
<br />
could come with some ideas?
<br />
