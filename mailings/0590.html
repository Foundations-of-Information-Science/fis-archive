Dear Fisers
<br />
Before making small comments to some very interesting postings, some jockey words about the new NASA pictures of Hubble.  
<br />
<p>When we look at the universe, we look from some kind of &quot;inside&quot; &quot;out&quot;. Our inside is certainly very complex but is only capable to surveive in a very narrow frame of sharply determining parameters. We are intrinsic part and product of its whole evolution. If we consider that there is only one chance to 1 trillion that there are other evoluted planets, there are still uncountable possibilities left that this could happen. In other words, the universe is a huge quantity of mass-energy ruled by very &quot;determined&quot; laws which triggers evolution. This means that &quot;something&quot; from past is transmitted and &quot;survives&quot; in the future! So, this universe can be considered being a real huge Memory with about (maybe) 1033 bites of processing capacity. The number is quite casuistic but represents the aprox. temperature (in° K) of the (actually somehow criticized) Big Bang, considering temperature as a scale to measure movement of mass.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>So, why should I think that Information only emerges with us?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Now to some comments
<br />
<p>Christian said:
<br />
<p>I would suggest that self-organising physical and chemical systems are not just reactive, but also reflective in the sense of a &quot;widerspiegelung&quot;: they not only react in some way, also some influence/stimuli/perturbation results in the emergence of order and structural changes, a stimuli is reflected within the structure as an emerging new quality. this reflection is not a mechanical one, but a non-deterministic one that is constrained by systemic properties.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Comment: I agree absolutely, because this is exactly what makes evolution of the universe POSSIBLE. I must say that I called this stage of evolution reactive in lack of a better word to distinguish it from the next step. Maybe reflection and reflex ion are really better options.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Jerry: 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the Second Law and Shannon's Law are two different statements; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they have in common is a mathematical formalism. Such sharing of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formalism is not at all unusual in theoretical physics: thus water waves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and light waves obey the same differential equations---but nobody would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclude from this that light and ripples on water are the same thing.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Walter Elsasser, Reflections on a Theory of Organisms, Johns Hopkins
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;UP, 1998, p. 46.)
</em><br />
<p><p><p>Comment: The common mathematical formalism of the second and Shannon's law is being discussed for quite a lot of years. And there are still a lot of people divides on that question. Personally I don't believe that it is only a pure coincidence of mathematical formalism.
<br />
<p>In fact, both equations state the relationship between macroscopic stability and microscopic statistical probabilities of a system. That's why I am not surprised of their similarity.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Juan Roederer
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>&quot;...We say that a (complex) system A is in information-based interaction
<br />
with a (complex) system B if the configuration of A, or, more precisely,
<br />
the presence of a certain spatial or temporal feature in system A causes a
<br />
specific alteration in the structure of system B, with a final state that
<br />
depends ONLY on whether that particular feature is present in A. ... (I)n
<br />
an information-based interaction a one-to-one correspondence is
<br />
established between a spatial or temporal feature or pattern in system A
<br />
and a specific change triggered in B; this correspondence depends only on
<br />
the pattern in question, being independent of other circumstances. ...
<br />
While in basic physical interactions there is an energy flow between the
<br />
interacting bodies or to and from the interaction mechanism, in
<br />
information-based interactions any energy required for the participating
<br />
(but not controlling) physical processes must be provided (or absorbed) by
<br />
a reservoir external to the interaction process. ... (I)nformation-based
<br />
interactions are usually &quot;discontinuous&quot;, in the sense that if the
<br />
original pattern at the source is modified in a steady, continuous way,
<br />
the response in the recipient may not vary at all in a continuous way. 
<br />
. Although we have been talking about information, we must now provide a
<br />
more formal definition: information is the agent that mediates the above
<br />
described correspondence--it is what links the particular features or
<br />
pattern in the source system A with the specific changes caused in the
<br />
structure of the recipient B. In other words, information represents and
<br />
defines the uniqueness of this correspondence; as such, it is an
<br />
irreducible entity (the footnote here says: Think of the &quot;A-ness&quot; conveyed
<br />
in visual interaction with the symbols a, A, alpha, aleph, or the
<br />
&quot;three-ness&quot; conveyed by any set containing three elements. Note a certain
<br />
analogy between our definition of information with Cantor's definition of
<br />
integer number: &quot;that which all coordinable sets have in common&quot;). ... 
<br />
Note that in a natural system we cannot have &quot;information alone&quot;, detached
<br />
from any interaction process past, present or future: information is
<br />
always there for a purpose. ... (T)his indeed is Kuepper's &quot;pragmatic
<br />
information&quot;. ... Given a complex system, structural order alone does not
<br />
represent information-information appears only when structural order leads
<br />
to specific change elsewhere. ...&quot;
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Comment: This reminds me the excellent definition of Weizsäcker: &quot;Information is a structure, (this means) an order, a form of objects, carriers of potential information, able to release (trigger?) &quot;Self activity&quot; in a receiving system. Objective Information is so far a condition for the possibility of subjective Information&quot;.  
<br />
<p>I hope my translation is ok. Isn't it somehow what you mean?
