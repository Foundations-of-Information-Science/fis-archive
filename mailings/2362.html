Dear Rafael &amp; Michael,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful opening text. Given that apparently ethics is far 
<br />
away from an informational perspective (and that they can only be 
<br />
reproached through the contraption &quot;info ethics&quot;), perhaps a preliminary 
<br />
discussion on the evolution of social complexity might be in order. Let me 
<br />
try with a few basic ideas.
<br />
<p>If we go to the most primitive human societies, e.g., following Jared 
<br />
Diamond, to those proto-groups (hunter-gatherer &quot;bands&quot;) of 60 to 100 
<br />
people, there we find the enactment of your &quot;bios&quot; (see below in R &amp; M 
<br />
text), and only that. Behaving into that close-knit group goes mostly as a 
<br />
direct gift from our genome, supposing that a regular epigenesis and a 
<br />
regular social group are embracing the individual. In this &quot;natural&quot; 
<br />
setting, the morality is pretty strict. No ethics needed.
<br />
<p>With husbandry, agriculture, villages, etc. (artificial ecosystems), we 
<br />
have a different and far more complex social environment ---not readily 
<br />
accessible like the previous one. Some social inventions are needed, 
<br />
including norms of behavior regarding people not directly connected 
<br />
(conflicts, extended parenthood), plus the forging of a collective 
<br />
identity, ceremonies, counting, calendars, etc. Indeed this has to be made 
<br />
coherently, more or less rationally, and overall this appears as the social 
<br />
creation of the &quot;ethos&quot; (see below) terribly dependent on the concrete 
<br />
artificial ecosystems which support social life.
<br />
<p>In a common view of both bios &amp; ethos, one could emphasize that crossing a 
<br />
critical threshold of complexity in the social network is at stake. Beyond 
<br />
that, our evolutionary genotype-phenotype--&quot;sociotype&quot; cannot provide 
<br />
anymore the behavioral guidance. From the instinctive &quot;moral&quot; we need 
<br />
additional &quot;ethics&quot; (as Rafael implies, the latter often putting into 
<br />
question big portions of the former). Given that any stage in social 
<br />
evolution, social complexity is tantamount to the overlap of dynamic social 
<br />
networks (or networks of social &quot;bonds&quot;), which are built, maintained, 
<br />
dissolved, etc., by information exchange ---one arrives with some relative 
<br />
easiness to the notion that indeed there is deep connection between 
<br />
information and ethics.
<br />
<p>Let me boldly argue that ethics means but the conditions for &quot;collective 
<br />
closure&quot; of a viable, complex society. So, previous &quot;informational 
<br />
revolutions&quot; in societies have always needed to put in a different light 
<br />
the ethical dimension, irrespective of the concrete &quot;doctrine&quot; which has 
<br />
torn asunder the preexisting fabric. And nowadays it is the turn for the 
<br />
genuine &quot;information society (as questions Q2 -- Q5 clearly imply).
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. I have just received Karl's and cannot include comments on it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not only controversial concerning its methodology and goals but also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concerning its very nature. Philosophers have been developing ethical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theories for thousands of years in different cultures. One starting point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for our discussions could be the difference between &quot;life&quot; in a biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense and &quot;life&quot; or &quot;human existence&quot;. This difference was basic in Greek 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy. The ancient Greek used two different words for life, namely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;zoe&quot; and &quot;bios&quot;. Ethics is basically about &quot;bios,&quot; i.e., about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'design' of human existence or of the place where we live (&quot;ethos&quot;). This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;presupposes that we do not only live within open possibilities (this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the case of other living beings too), but that we are aware of them. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;classic terms, this is the question of freedom in the sense not only of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;freedom &quot;from&quot; but of freedom &quot;for&quot;. But things are of course more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex, since we are not only living beings in the sense of &quot;bios&quot; but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also of &quot;zoe&quot; so that our options for &quot;good life&quot; are intertwined with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibilities given by nature as well as with the ones we artificially 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;create by ourselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;......
</em><br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We usually make a difference between ethics and morality, where ethics (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;techne ethiké&quot;) is the science of morals (&quot;ethos&quot;), morals being the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenon we study. This is an important difference because in normal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;life people use both words (and even both concepts!) as synonyms. It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also important to grasp ethics as the place where morality can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(theoretically) questioned. In other words, an ethical discussion arises 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when given moral laws governing our behavior are not any more obvious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As you know, Kant suggested that moral laws should be conceived in analogy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to natural laws from a formal standpoint. Kant also made a strong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference between human beings as far as they belong to nature and as far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as they are &quot;ends in themselves.&quot; These (and other) Kantian are part of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our Western culture, including our legal norms. They were Kant's answer to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Newton, i.e., to a universe conceived as deterministic in which there was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no place for freedom. We have not a similar fundamental philosophic answer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to modern science (evolution, quantum physics, molecular biology etc.). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, our suggestion is to start discussing this matter.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
