<p>
Last week, Pedro expressed a reservation about my realism in the
<br />
following terms:
<br />
<p>&quot;The way natural Law is handled by realists implies for me a
<br />
dualistic-Platonic scheme...&quot;
<br />
<p>Now, I agree that reductionists are guilty of dualism in this sense, and
<br />
I further agree with Pedro (and with Howard Pattee, Robert Rosen, and
<br />
many others) that this is a fundamental mistake. That is, the
<br />
teleological (normative, semantic) aspect of life processes is
<br />
definitely NOT reducible to mechanistic interactions.
<br />
<p>But the question I would ask is, must &quot;natural law&quot; be equivalent to
<br />
mechanism? Here, I think we must really engage in what Ted felicitously
<br />
called &quot;engineering of the metaphysic.&quot; Namely, we must reject the
<br />
reductionist temptation of identifying the &quot;laws of nature&quot; with
<br />
mechanistic interactions only.
<br />
<p>What is the alternative?  A robust (ontological, not just epistemic)
<br />
emergentism. What might this mean?
<br />
<p>If the high-energy physicists are right, then all that matters is
<br />
getting the Theory of Everything pinned down. Once we have that, then
<br />
everything else follows by deduction. There will be one equation that we
<br />
can put on our T-shirts that will explain everything, including the
<br />
origin and evolution of life, human nature and history, and even the
<br />
brand name on the T-shirt itself. However, if one finds this
<br />
super-Laplacian worldview absurd (as I do, and I assume most here at FIS
<br />
do, as well), then it is possible to conceive of &quot;natural law&quot; as having
<br />
a different significance.
<br />
<p>I have the impression that some of the subjectivist and idealist flavor
<br />
of much of our discussion derives from a tacit acceptance of the TOE
<br />
picture for the inorganic world, together with the realization that the
<br />
normative character of cognition nevertheless cannot be fit into this
<br />
picture. So, instead, some of us retreat to idealism
<br />
(pan-informationism) or to dualism (Pattee's &quot;complementarity&quot;).
<br />
However, I believe there is a viable realist alternative---namely,
<br />
rejecting the TOE picture altogether as a misguided fantasy.
<br />
<p>If the condensed-matter physicists are right (e.g., Laughlin &amp; Pines,
<br />
PNAS, 2000, 97: 28--31; P.W. Anderson, Science, 2000, 288: 480--482),
<br />
then new kinds of structures with qualitatively novel causal powers have
<br />
emerged over the course of cosmic evolution, and these novel causal
<br />
powers will require sui generis &quot;effective&quot; theories---unique to each
<br />
level and irreducible to laws at lower levels---to descibe them
<br />
adequately (see, also, W. Thirring, &quot;Do the Laws of Nature Evolve?,&quot; in
<br />
M.P. Murphy and L.A.J. O'Neill, What Is Life? The Next Fifty Years
<br />
[Cambridge UP, 1995, pp. 131--136]).
<br />
<p>In that case, there is indeed hope that we can someday discover emergent
<br />
&quot;laws of nature&quot; (in a broad sense) that adequately describe the causal
<br />
powers distinctive of life (R.B. Laughlin et al., PNAS, 2000, 97:
<br />
32--37).  Most distinctive of all those powers is intrinsic normative
<br />
functionality, by which I mean low-energy (i.e., information)-guided
<br />
purposive action, where the &quot;success&quot; of such action consists in the
<br />
preservation of the dynamical stability of the nonlinear oscillator
<br />
carrying out the action (F.E. Yates, Mathematical and Computer
<br />
Modelling, 1994, 19: 49--74; J. Barham, BioSystems, 1996, 38: 235--241).
<br />
<p>The crucial metaphysical point to take away from this &quot;neo-vitalist&quot;
<br />
view is that the material constitution of a system does matter for the
<br />
causal powers of the system, after all.  That is, we have simply been
<br />
mistaken in accepting the multiple realizability thesis all these years.
<br />
This means that living things are not machines at all, and that the
<br />
derivative, externally-imposed functionality of machines and the
<br />
intrinsic, spontaneous intelligent striving of organisms belong to two
<br />
entirely distinct causal categories. In other words, intrinsic
<br />
functionality and intrinsic normativity can only arise out of the sui
<br />
generis dynamics of the living state (specifically, that of the
<br />
protein-ordered water-phosphate gel), never out of an artificially
<br />
engineered set of boundary conditions externally imposed upon
<br />
intrinsically inert matter.
<br />
<p>Note that this does not mean that the artificial construction of living
<br />
systems with intrinsic functionality is inherently impossible; it just
<br />
means that it will require the use of organic materials with the correct
<br />
causal powers.
<br />

<br />
<p>P.S. Anyone interested in further elaboration of these ideas might like
<br />
to consult my &quot;Biofunctional Realism and the Problem of Teleology,&quot;
<br />
Evolution and Cognition, 2000, 6: 2--34; and &quot;Theses on Darwin,&quot; Rivista
<br />
