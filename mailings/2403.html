Unsolved question
<br />
The identity question has been addressed by Wittgenstein, as he mused &quot;what
<br />
is identity? If a thing is the same as an other thing then they are not two
<br />
things.&quot; - but here he left off. So, the question of identity of whatever
<br />
(in this our discussion, presently, ethics) is rather unsolved as such.
<br />
Sets of references
<br />
The main point with identity, and with ethics, too, appears to be that we
<br />
compare an expected set of values to an observed set of values. We compare
<br />
remembered values to observed values. We remember how it should be and we
<br />
see how it is. We end up with a set of transcendence and a set of reality.
<br />
Between these two we continuously compare.
<br />
Ethics to moral : autoregulation to heteroregulation
<br />
The polarisation is also known as egotistic and altruistic motivation. A
<br />
system optimising its own pleasure will behave in a maximally ethical way, a
<br />
system optimising the wishes of others will behave in a maximally moral way;
<br />
ethics being the system of congruences between inner expectations and
<br />
(self-)observed behaviour, moral being the system of congruences between
<br />
externally expected roles and (self-)observed behaviour.
<br />
Overoptimisation
<br />
If one behaves exclusively self-optimising, one will lose the group's
<br />
respect. If one behaves exclusively servile, one loses the self-respect.
<br />
Usual range
<br />
We implicitly expect among each other to behave in a moderate,
<br />
middle-of-the-road, common-sense way. We agree about quite many ranges of
<br />
optimal, usual, preferred, normal, reasonable extents, even if we do not
<br />
take the time to enumerate them.
<br />
Proposal
<br />
Let us get down to the hard rock solid foundation of what is usual, normal,
<br />
frequent, ordinary in the world. The same numeric functions govern our
<br />
interpersonal (and intrapersonal) proceedings, too. We agree about the usual
<br />
extent of variability in a group. We know if it is getting too boring and we
<br />
know if it is too abrupt, unconnected, conflictuous - not uniformly
<br />
neighboured the steps.
<br />
Variability, freedom and identity
<br />
We discuss predictions and extents of variability. We predict the behaviour
<br />
of a person and compare it to a usual range just like we predict the
<br />
position of a DNA marker and compare the extent of changes we expect to
<br />
generate by this marker (as opposed to a different marker on the same
<br />
place).
<br />
Basis of predictions
<br />
We use (in our brain and in our system) a duality which roots in the
<br />
similarity and the difference of the things the world is made up of. Our
<br />
conscious thinking has been drilled to observe and take into account the
<br />
similarity property of the things the world is made up of. The other set of
<br />
values we operate on is the background, relative to which we observe the
<br />
similarities. We do not discuss the properties of the background because we
<br />
do not notice it, it being the background.
<br />
Dissimilarity property
<br />
I wish for an elementary school math book where not only 1+1=2 is given as
<br />
an axiom and a rule but also 1 # 2 # 3 ... as well. If the next generation
<br />
grows up by learning to observe the dissimilarity (as a countable property)
<br />
of things and of concepts, as legitimate and fruitful as the similarity
<br />
property, then we shall be able to understand the concept of identity.
<br />
Ethical and observed behaviour
<br />
These both are frequency distributions. If a behaviour agrees to the dot to
<br />
the other, we have identity (between expectation and observation). The main
<br />
point is too trivial to be noticed: that we have TWO sets of references
<br />
which are somehow connected. The same rules govern the interplay between any
<br />
TWO sets of references, be it physics, chemistry, economics, genetics or
<br />
interpersonal communications. There is always a set of expectations
<br />
(&quot;Sollwert&quot;) against which a second set of values (&quot;Istwert&quot;) gets compared.
<br />
Forces and predictions
<br />
A rigorous translation of everything and all into probability extents opens
<br />
up nice new ways of looking at, e.g., forces. Gravitation is specifically a
<br />
prediction about a place. In human behaviour, we also predict the behaviour
<br />
table and measure the force of the urge on that, how predictably we
<br />
encounter an element of the repertoire.
