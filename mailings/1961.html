                <p>
                    Dear All
                    <br />
                <p>I am really sorry for not having had the time to participate in this
                    <br />
                    discussion that is so central to my work. Allow me to point out that my use
                    <br />
                    of Peirce's philosophy is a way to solve the externalist-internalist
                    <br />
                    problem, which Peirce does with his triadic philosophy and ontology that
                    <br />
                    introduces the pure feeling in Firstness and see it as something internal to
                    <br />
                    matter as it manifests in Secondness and turning into dynamic stabilities in
                    <br />
                    Thirdness.(My Peirce interpretation seem here to differ from John's). My
                    <br />
                    paper in the first issue of the electronic journal of TripleC
                    <br />
                    (<a href="../../triplec.uti.at/home.php">http://triplec.uti.at/home.php</a>) try to explain this
                    discussion and why I do
                    <br />
                    not think that the objective information processing paradigm, cybernetics
                    <br />
                    and systems theory - not even in Luhmann's sophisticated version - can solve
                    <br />
                    this problem. This is why I have semiotized Luhmann (in the electronic
                    <br />
                    <a
                        href="../../www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/Journal/dentro.html">http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/Journal/dentro.html</a>
                    Journal of
                    <br />
                    Sociocybernetics V.3 ,N. 2). Therefore I with Wolfgang Hofkirchner and
                    <br />
                    Christian Fuchs believe that we have to start our ideas of Consilience with
                    <br />
                    embodied, semiotic, communicative, conscious human systems in social praxis
                    <br />
                    and co-operation (cognition, communication and co-operation) in a historical
                    <br />
                    and evolutionary frame work with a theory of self-organization and
                    <br />
                    emergence.( We just finished the long version of our report from the group
                    <br />
                    work conference in Fuschl this year and will soon put it up at the FIS home
                    <br />
                    page to have your feedback, and we will probably touch on these results in
                    <br />
                    the Paris conference this summer. Standard and general system science with
                    <br />
                    information science in it does do the trick in itself. You have to add an
                    <br />
                    internalist point of view also (I use this concept here different from
                    <br />
                    Koichiro as I think of the world from within our mind and life world). This
                    <br />
                    is possible through Peirce's semiotics that is also phenomenological. We
                    <br />
                    have to start in the middle of the human social life world where knowledge
                    <br />
                    is created and later cultivated to science. All the critical social studies
                    <br />
                    of science shows us that it is very difficult to get behind that social
                    <br />
                    prerequisite for science and get to a truth of a world beyond; be it the
                    <br />
                    social reality, the real nature, the pure consciousness or the core of life
                    <br />
                    and body hood. As Bruno Latour point out, we produce quasi-objects of
                    <br />
                    knowledge and technology that are true and functioning always under special
                    <br />
                    network, cognitive and technological conditions. Thus to evaluate our
                    <br />
                    knowledge and the possibility of transdisciplinary common frames of
                    <br />
                    understanding and knowledge building we always have to reflect on it both
                    <br />
                    from a social, natural, living and first person conscious or
                    <br />
                    phenomenological point of view if we want to avoid the positivistic
                    <br />
                    reductionist conception of the unity of knowledge with physics as the model
                    <br />
                    science. A view that Wilson and researchers like Dawkins and Dennett have
                    <br />
                    only moved a little away from by a more refined version of evolution based
                    <br />
                    on selfish genes.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;each other. Of course, there is no reason not to be concerned about how

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;this complementation might be accomplished.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Yeh, that is what brought me into philosophy (my first undergrad paper was
                    <br />
                    on the topic). I started studying information theory in 1971 because I
                    <br />
                    thought it was the key to the problem. I still think so. The biggest
                    <br />
                    obstacle I see at this point is that proponents of both sides seem to feel
                    <br />
                    that they are giving something up by any unification (e.g., the
                    <br />
                    externalists think that they have surrendered to the mystics, and the
                    <br />
                    internalists think that they have surrendered to objectivists, or something
                    <br />
                    like that). The bits I had a chance to see of this discussion were quite
                    <br />
                    interesting, and some of the intemperate and almost religious assumption of
                    <br />
                    subjective or objective perspectives made my blood boil. I hope people will
                    <br />
                    learn to curb their dogma on this forum. At least try to be as neutral as
                    <br />
                    you can so some agreement is possible. You'd think some of you were taking
                    <br />
                    lessons from George Bush. I wrote my doctoral dissertation on
                    <br />
                    incommensurability, and I argued that it was a pragmatic problem, not a
                    <br />
                    logical one. One solves it by finding a larger perspective. So, away with
                    <br />
                    narrow minded subjective constructivism and narrow minded objective
                    <br />
                    empiricism! They are both wrong, wrong, wrong.
