                <p>
                    Dear Colleagues,
                    <br />
                    I am delighted to have an opportunity to “listen” to the
                    <br />
                    discussion of quantum information. Thank you Andrei and
                    <br />
                    Jonathan for the informative and concise introduction, thank
                    <br />
                    you Andrei for your skillful moderation, and many thanks to
                    <br />
                    others for interesting contributions. Since the discussion
                    <br />
                    drifted towards the issues of the foundations of quantum
                    <br />
                    theory, the subject of my old (first) research love, I
                    <br />
                    cannot resist temptation to add my two pennies. I hope that
                    <br />
                    my comments may become helpful in answering some questions.
                    <br />
                    For instance, the degree in which quantum mechanics deviates
                    <br />
                    from classical mechanics, or the question about the
                    <br />
                    difference between quantum and classical probability.
                    <br />
                <p>HOW THE PHYSICISTS INTERPRET QUANTUM THEORY?
                    <br />
                <p>However, I would like to start from one more general
                    <br />
                    comment. Some of the earlier contributors where referring to
                    <br />
                    the way quantum theory is interpreted by physicists, as if
                    <br />
                    there was such one interpretation. I am afraid, there is not
                    <br />
                    such thing as uniform interpretation of quantum theory and
                    <br />
                    never has been any uniformity in this regard. What united
                    <br />
                    (temporarily) physicists was common agreement about the
                    <br />
                    formalism. But even in this case there has been some
                    <br />
                    diversity of the views.
                    <br />
                    Physicists have been always divided in their views on the
                    <br />
                    subject of interpretations. Usually the division is
                    <br />
                    presented as if it was only a solitary giant Einstein who
                    <br />
                    refused to play the dice with God against Copenhagen
                    <br />
                    Interpretation promoted by Bohr, Heisenberg, et al.
                    <br />
                    Actually, the person who exhausted Heisenberg and Bohr in
                    <br />
                    the discussions the most was Schroedinger, who never
                    <br />
                    accepted their views.
                    <br />
                    Later, in the second half of the XXth century when QM has
                    <br />
                    become the usual stuff of undergraduate physics program, the
                    <br />
                    primary division of the physicists has developed not along
                    <br />
                    the borders of different interpretations of QM, but between
                    <br />
                    the vast majority who simply did not have any view and did
                    <br />
                    not care much about it (at least not after graduating from
                    <br />
                    college,) and those few deviants who still wanted to discuss
                    <br />
                    it in their professional activities. When I was a physics
                    <br />
                    student, majority of my professors where openly hostile to
                    <br />
                    the discussions of QM interpretation. “If you continue to
                    <br />
                    waste your time on QM interpretation, you will never do
                    <br />
                    anything important in physics!” was the usual dictum. Well,
                    <br />
                    it has become true in my case. But I do not regret it. If I
                    <br />
                    listened to them, I would have missed a lot of fun which I
                    <br />
                    experienced in trying to understand quantum mechanics. After
                    <br />
                    all, it is not likely that any “schroederons” would have
                    <br />
                    been collided in the accelerators today, if I gave up
                    <br />
                    asking “stupid” questions about foundations of QM. Later
                    <br />
                    when I was already a faculty member, I could hear frequently
                    <br />
                    in informal conversations carried in between conference
                    <br />
                    talks the criticisms like: “Did you listen to Brown. Too
                    <br />
                    bad, the guy is finished. He has nothing interesting to say.
                    <br />
                    No results, just philosophy.”
                    <br />
                    The negative attitude to the matters of interpretation can
                    <br />
                    be found even in the famous Feynman’s Lectures, where he
                    <br />
                    wrote humorously, but approvingly (I have never forgiven him
                    <br />
                    this comment) that the interpretation of QM is no more a
                    <br />
                    matter of interest to physicists, as they do not talk about
                    <br />
                    it at lunches and dinners anymore.
                    <br />
                <p>DIFFERENCES IN INTERPRETATION VERSUS DIFFERENCES IN
                    <br />
                    FORMALISMS
                    <br />
                <p>Those who still considered foundations of QM as a valid
                    <br />
                    subject of research have been divided not so much by
                    <br />
                    differences in interpretation, but in the choice of
                    <br />
                    formalism, which of course influenced the way of
                    <br />
                    interpretation. In our discussion the attention of
                    <br />
                    contributors has been drawn to the interpretation of the
                    <br />
                    wave functions. Before the two bibles of QM have been
                    <br />
                    published (Andrei used this very good metaphoric expression
                    <br />
                    to emphasize the importance of von Neumann’s book
                    <br />
                    Foundations… published in 1932, but there was another
                    <br />
                    influential book published two years earlier, Dirac’s
                    <br />
                    Principles…; both deserve to be considered the holy
                    <br />
                    scriptures) quantum theory has been discussed in terms
                    <br />
                    either of wave functions (Schroedinger’s picture) or
                    <br />
                    matrices (Heisenberg’s picture). The pictures were roughly
                    <br />
                    equivalent (however not from the strict mathematical point
                    <br />
                    of view), but since wave functions could be easily
                    <br />
                    associated with the conventional knowledge through Born’s
                    <br />
                    interpretation of the “square” of a wave function as
                    <br />
                    probability amplitude, most discussions were based on
                    <br />
                    Schroedinger’s approach. What von Neumann really did in
                    <br />
                    his “bible” was that he got rid of the wave functions from
                    <br />
                    the picture. The reason was that there is no one to one
                    <br />
                    correspondence between the quantum states and wave
                    <br />
                    functions. Multiply the wave function by any complex number
                    <br />
                    of modulus one and the state is the same, but wave function
                    <br />
                    different. Also, you can use functions of different
                    <br />
                    variables to describe the same state. It has become clear
                    <br />
                    that the wave function is a theoretical construct, not an
                    <br />
                    object with direct physical interpretation. In von Neumann’s
                    <br />
                    formalism the central role is played by a Hilbert space, and
                    <br />
                    wave functions were just elements of the convenient
                    <br />
                    representation of such a space. It is true, generations of
                    <br />
                    experimental physicists, chemists, etc. were using wave
                    <br />
                    functions and Schroedinger’s equations without ever thinking
                    <br />
                    about Hilbert spaces, but it is a matter of practical
                    <br />
                    applications in which the choice of concepts and their
                    <br />
                    understanding are secondary issues. Those who were looking
                    <br />
                    for understanding QM knew that you cannot interpret one
                    <br />
                    concept without interpretation of all formalism. And the
                    <br />
                    concept of a wave function does not furnish a full formalism
                    <br />
                    of quantum theory. Von Neumann provided such a consistent
                    <br />
                    formalism in terms which did not use the concept of a wave
                    <br />
                    function as fundamental. Actually, he even assumed that
                    <br />
                    quantum state is not described by a vector in the Hilbert
                    <br />
                    space, but by a one dimensional subspace or equivalently by
                    <br />
                    a projector on such a subspace. So, a wave function
                    <br />
                    disappeared from the view. It was long way from de Broglie
                    <br />
                    who believed that the wave functions are actual physical
                    <br />
                    waves.
                    <br />
                <p>After von Neumann published his Foundations several other
                    <br />
                    different formalisms have been introduced, such as algebraic
                    <br />
                    formalism based on C* algebras (started 1934 by Jordan,von
                    <br />
                    Neumann, and Wigner, developed later in different variations
                    <br />
                    by Segal, Haag and Koestler, Gelfand and Naimark), convex
                    <br />
                    state space approach (initiated by Stone, and von Neumann
                    <br />
                    and Morgenstern, and developed by Mielnik, Ludwig, Davies
                    <br />
                    and Lewis), quantum logic approach (initiated 1936 by
                    <br />
                    Birkhoff and von Neumann, developed by Jauch and Piron and
                    <br />
                    many others). It is amazing that each time the name of von
                    <br />
                    Neumann appears among initiators of the very different
                    <br />
                    approaches.
                    <br />
                <p>Why were physicists looking for new formalisms?
                    <br />
                    There were two main motivations. First, there was no fully
                    <br />
                    general and consistent relativistic QM formalism. Quantum
                    <br />
                    electrodynamics has been developed giving amazingly accurate
                    <br />
                    results, but by the price of some mathematically suspicious
                    <br />
                    steps and without a perspective of one universal
                    <br />
                    relativistic quantum theoretical formalism which could serve
                    <br />
                    all physics (including gravitation). Even now there is no
                    <br />
                    such such formalism available. This I think is a main reason
                    <br />
                    for saying that physics is in a crisis. If you compare the
                    <br />
                    success of putting together all physical interactions except
                    <br />
                    gravitation with the failure of developing a uniform
                    <br />
                    mathematical model of the reality in which forces may be
                    <br />
                    distinct, but methods of inquiry uniform, which one is more
                    <br />
                    important? But &quot;crisis&quot; means &quot;judgment&quot; in Greek, so maybe
                    <br />
                    soon we will find the eternal bliss.
                    <br />
                <p>The second motivation was to get rid of the elements of the
                    <br />
                    theory which are clearly redundant. I have mentioned that
                    <br />
                    the wave functions has been removed from the picture (but of
                    <br />
                    course not from the tool kit of those who were applying
                    <br />
                    physics to solving particular problems) because they
                    <br />
                    involved many elements which did not have any physical or
                    <br />
                    philosophical interpretation. The formalism presented in von
                    <br />
                    Neumann’s Foundations still had a lot of redundancy. Of
                    <br />
                    course, any new formalism had to have special case which
                    <br />
                    could be interpreted in Hilbert space language, but the
                    <br />
                    formalism itself should be free of all what was not
                    <br />
                    necessary.
                    <br />
                <p>WHAT IS COMMON IN DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO QM?
                    <br />
                <p>So, what was necessary? By the time of Foundations it was
                    <br />
                    clear that any formalism has to describe the two notions, of
                    <br />
                    the state(s) of a system and of the observable(s). It is
                    <br />
                    interesting that before QM was born the state of the system
                    <br />
                    has been almost completely neglected. It was considered
                    <br />
                    obvious that the state of the system is directly given by
                    <br />
                    the values of observables. In classical mechanics, when we
                    <br />
                    have enough functions on the state space (phase space), the
                    <br />
                    state can be identified uniquely as the unique element of
                    <br />
                    the intersection of inverse images of the values of
                    <br />
                    functions representing observables. In QM the separation of
                    <br />
                    the roles of the concept of a state and of observables has
                    <br />
                    become fundamental. In classical mechanics (CM) every
                    <br />
                    observable has some unique and clearly determined value in
                    <br />
                    each state of the system (the state was identified as a
                    <br />
                    point in the phase space, and the observable was a function
                    <br />
                    on this space).
                    <br />
                    Now, in quantum mechanics (QM) it turned out that in some
                    <br />
                    states the system may have specific value of an observable,
                    <br />
                    in some states not. It seems strange and un-intuitional.
                    <br />
                    However strange it is, no physicist would object this formal
                    <br />
                    fact (as long as either of the formalisms of QM are
                    <br />
                    accepted.) Now, the question is whether it is because of
                    <br />
                    inadequacy of the description of the state (knowing some
                    <br />
                    additional hidden variables describing the state it would be
                    <br />
                    possible to identify the unique values of all observables,)
                    <br />
                    or the description is the best possible and the system in
                    <br />
                    some states simply does not posses the properties which
                    <br />
                    determine uniquely the values of observables. Here are
                    <br />
                    differences in views.
                    <br />
                    Of course, no formalism can answer this question itself. The
                    <br />
                    only way to resolve the dillema (if at all possible) is to
                    <br />
                    check which formalism fits the best what we know from
                    <br />
                    experimental testing.
                    <br />
                <p>The formalisms which I mentioned above choose as the most
                    <br />
                    fundamental either the concept of an observable, the concept
                    <br />
                    of a state, or neither. The algebraic approach (which I
                    <br />
                    called C* algebra approach, but which actually involves in
                    <br />
                    its different variations different algebras) starts from an
                    <br />
                    algebra of observables, and proceeds to secondary concept of
                    <br />
                    the state. The convexity approach starts from the concept of
                    <br />
                    a convexity space of states and proceeds to observables.
                    <br />
                    The &quot;biblical&quot; approach involved both concepts of the state
                    <br />
                    and of the observable with equal status (states as
                    <br />
                    projectors, observables as selfadjoint operators). There is
                    <br />
                    finally the fourth possibility to use neither state, nor
                    <br />
                    observable as fundamental concept.
                    <br />
                <p>INTRO TO QUANTUM LOGIC
                    <br />
                <p>My favorite, the quantum logic approach starts from the
                    <br />
                    concept of the logic of events (in early times called often
                    <br />
                    yes-no propositions or yes-no experiments, but such names
                    <br />
                    may be confusing). There are many different ways the logic
                    <br />
                    of events and events themselves are interpreted. It is a
                    <br />
                    topic for a separate and long story. The simplest will be to
                    <br />
                    use the concept of an event as primitive concept and to use
                    <br />
                    for the explanation an analogy to the concept of an event in
                    <br />
                    probability. Here too, the question is not as trivial as it
                    <br />
                    may seem. What is an event that you get even score when you
                    <br />
                    roll a die. The naïve answer is based on the formal
                    <br />
                    representation of an event by the set {2,4,6}. But it does
                    <br />
                    not make sense to say that the set {2,4,6} occurred or
                    <br />
                    happened when the outcome was for instance 4. So an event is
                    <br />
                    not just a subset of the outcome set, but the fact that the
                    <br />
                    outcome belongs to the set representing event. Something
                    <br />
                    like that is in the case of quantum logic.
                    <br />
                <p>In the following I will risk several oversimplifications,
                    <br />
                    for which I have to apologize to those who know quantum
                    <br />
                    logics. I believe that clarity and limited space should go
                    <br />
                    before precision and accurateness this time.
                    <br />
                <p>The analogy to probability will be the best starting point.
                    <br />
                    In probability theory, we usually start from the set of
                    <br />
                    outcomes and events are defined as subsets of this set. In
                    <br />
                    preparation for more general concept of a quantum (or
                    <br />
                    empirical) logic, we will have to use a little bit more
                    <br />
                    abstract but equivalent formulation in which the power set
                    <br />
                    (the set of all subsets) of the outcome space is replaced by
                    <br />
                    an (atomic) Boolean algebra. All proability theory can be
                    <br />
                    formulated this way (Mazurkiewicz, Los, and many others).
                    <br />
                    Then we can introduce a probability measure on this Boolean
                    <br />
                    algebra. In the infinite case, we have to consider
                    <br />
                    probability measure only on measurable subsets, so the
                    <br />
                    Boolean algebra would correspond to the structure of
                    <br />
                    measurable subsets.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, in elementary classical probability we are introducing
                    <br />
                    the concept of random variables as (measurable) functions
                    <br />
                    from the outcome space to real numbers. Since we do not work
                    <br />
                    with subsets of the outcome space, but with Boolean algebra
                    <br />
                    of events, we will introduce first the concept of an
                    <br />
                    observable as a function from Borel sets of the set of real
                    <br />
                    numbers B(R) to our logic of events L (in this case having
                    <br />
                    the structure of Boolean algebra) satisfying some natural
                    <br />
                    conditions of structure preservation. Thus an observable is
                    <br />
                    in this case a measure on B(R) with values in Boolean
                    <br />
                    algebra L.
                    <br />
                    It turns out that in this classical probability case, when
                    <br />
                    we represent L by subsets of some set (of outcomes), to each
                    <br />
                    observable corresponds some random variable (i.e. function
                    <br />
                    from the set of outcomes to real numbers).
                    <br />
                    This part is little bit confusing (why observables “go”
                    <br />
                    opposite direction to random variables?),but it is just a
                    <br />
                    technical issue which does not have much influence on the
                    <br />
                    general concepts. We can eliminate it from our
                    <br />
                    consideration, if remember that observables and random
                    <br />
                    variables are in some correspondence, but they are not
                    <br />
                    completely identical.
                    <br />
                <p>Thus we have as a central concept the logic of events and a

                    probabilistic measures on (atomic) Boolean algebras in the
                    <br />
                    classical case. In classical mechanics the logic of events
                    <br />
                    is basically the Boolean algebra of subsets of a phase
                    <br />
                    space. The state is a probability measure on the subsets of
                    <br />
                    a phase space.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, how can we get to quantum mechanics? Consider the logic
                    <br />
                    of events which has the structure more general than Boolean
                    <br />
                    algebra. It has a binary operation of so called “meet”
                    <br />
                    (generalizing the intersection of sets in the Boolean
                    <br />
                    algebra of subsets, or the connective “and” in sentential
                    <br />
                    logic), a binary operation of join (union of sets or the
                    <br />
                    connective “or”), and a unary operation of orthocomplement
                    <br />
                    (Complement set for subsets, or the negation in sentential
                    <br />
                    logic). This kind of more general structure is called an
                    <br />
                    orthomodular lattice, when some conditions are satsfied.
                    <br />
                    Boolean algebras can be considered as special cases of
                    <br />
                    orthomodular lattices which are distinguished by the fact
                    <br />
                    that they satisfy the law of distributivity. This law is an
                    <br />
                    obvious rule in sentential logic or in a Boolean algebra of
                    <br />
                    subsets: A &amp;(B or C) = (A&amp;B) or (A&amp;C). In general
                    <br />
                    orthomodular lattices do not satisfy the rule of
                    <br />
                    distributivity, but much weaker condition of
                    <br />
                    orthomodularity. Its exact formulation is here not important
                    <br />
                    (it is not difficult, but would not help much in
                    <br />
                    understanding quantum logics).
                    <br />
                    The quantum logic of Hilbert space formulation is the
                    <br />
                    orthomodular lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space (or
                    <br />
                    equivalently the orthomodular lattice of projectors). But in
                    <br />
                    this approach we do not need any Hilbert space. We do not
                    <br />
                    have any concepts which do not correspond to physical
                    <br />
                    reality.
                    <br />
                    In some sense QM in the quantum logic approach can be
                    <br />
                    considered just a quantum version of probability theory.
                    <br />
                <p>IS QUANTUM PROBABILITY DIFFERENT FROM CLASSICAL PROBABILITY?
                    <br />
                <p>Yes and no. Classical probability is on Boolean algebras,
                    <br />
                    quantum probability on more general orthomodular lattices.
                    <br />
                    Thus, not all properties of classical probability can be
                    <br />
                    extended to this more general case. Please do not let
                    <br />
                    deceive yourself by the fact that in each case we have
                    <br />
                    basically the same axioms of the measure, or because we
                    <br />
                    assign some numbers between 0 and 1 to events. The axioms of
                    <br />
                    Boolean algebra belong (implicitely) to axioms of
                    <br />
                    probability. These stronger axioms give many properties to
                    <br />
                    classical probability which cannot be reproduced in the more
                    <br />
                    general (weaker axioms for the structure of logic) quantum
                    <br />
                    probability on quantum logics. Thus, the probabilities are
                    <br />
                    the same as bounded measures on orthomodular lattices. But,
                    <br />
                    they are different because the measures are defined on
                    <br />
                    different structures. There are many fundamental theorems
                    <br />
                    from classical probability which are not valid in the
                    <br />
                    quantum case.
                    <br />
                <p>SUPERSELECTION RULES – PHYSICAL SYSTEMS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY
                    <br />
                    QUANTUM THEORETICAL
                    <br />
                <p>First important advantage of the quantum logic approach is
                    <br />
                    that we can recognize that there are two extreme cases of
                    <br />
                    these (empirical) quantum logics, one is purely classical
                    <br />
                    (Boolean algebra,) one is purely quantum (in the formal
                    <br />
                    language of this theory completely irreducible,) and then
                    <br />
                    big number of intermediate cases.
                    <br />
                    How to understand it?
                    <br />
                    Boolean algebra can be decomposed completely into the direct
                    <br />
                    product of two element Boolean algebras (into “bits”). In
                    <br />
                    the pure quantum case, the orthomodular lattice is non-
                    <br />
                    decomposable (irreducible) into direct product at all. It
                    <br />
                    corresponds to the fact that each two states can be
                    <br />
                    superposed (entangled). For the cases in between, partial
                    <br />
                    decomposition into direct product is possible, but only into
                    <br />
                    the components which are irreducible but different from two
                    <br />
                    element Boolean algebras (bits). Entaglement is possible
                    <br />
                    only within completely irreducible &quot;sector&quot; of quantum
                    <br />
                    logic. Superselection rules describe such partial
                    <br />
                    decomposition into irreducible sectors. They can be
                    <br />
                    introduced by an observable (called superobservable) which
                    <br />
                    is compatible with all other observables (using Hilbert
                    <br />
                    space language, which commute with all other observables).
                    <br />
                    On purely quantum system there are no superobservables. In
                    <br />
                    physics we have several superobservables, such as mass,
                    <br />
                    charge, etc.
                    <br />
                    It corresponds to the fact that you cannot entangle electron
                    <br />
                    and proton, or electron and photon. Thus the actual physical
                    <br />
                    systems have frequently logics which are somewhere between
                    <br />
                    classical and purely quantum ones.
                    <br />
                <p>CAN WE FIND ENTANGLEMENT IN LIVING ORGANIZMS?
                    <br />
                <p>Are this irreducible quantum logics unique to quantum
                    <br />
                    theory? Not. We have many simple examples of irreducibility
                    <br />
                    around. The logic of subspaces of any linear space is
                    <br />
                    irreducible. Or, we can describe geometry in terms of such a
                    <br />
                    logic. Then we can talk about “entangled points”. This
                    <br />
                    means that when we consider any two different points, they
                    <br />
                    form a line. Now this line has many other points and can be
                    <br />
                    described using these other points.
                    <br />
                    Observe that it cannot happen in the Boolean algebra of
                    <br />
                    subsets. If you take two one element sets, they will form a
                    <br />
                    two element set, but this set has only these two elements.
                    <br />
                    There is only one way you can “dis-entangle” such a set
                    <br />
                    into elements generating it. In geometry, you can dis-
                    <br />
                    entangle the line into many different pairs of generating
                    <br />
                    points.
                    <br />
                    BUT, please be careful, this entanglement is not exactly the
                    <br />
                    same as quantum entanglement as the structures are
                    <br />
                    essentially different. They are similar in the fact that
                    <br />
                    they share the same property of irreducibility.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, the question is: Is it possible that an organism
                    <br />
                    (human) could be the result of entanglement of its parts? I
                    <br />
                    doubt it. It is possible that the organism is decomposable
                    <br />
                    into parts which are irreducible. But physics gives quite
                    <br />
                    straight answer. There are definitely some superobservables
                    <br />
                    in the description of the organism as a physical object.
                    <br />
                    On the other hand, it is possible that some aspects of human
                    <br />
                    organism (but not the body) can form a structure which is
                    <br />
                    irreducible (entangled). There is nothing in quantum logic
                    <br />
                    formulation of QM which makes it exclusively physical, or
                    <br />
                    which restricts it to elementary particles. Quantum
                    <br />
                    character is simply a property of irreducibility of the
                    <br />
                    logical structure, and such logical structures can be found
                    <br />
                    in many non-physical contexts (e.g. geometry on the plane).
                    <br />
                    However, every nontrivial (dimension higher than two)
                    <br />
                    quantum logic (i.e. logic satisfying all axioms) must be
                    <br />
                    infinite. I am not sure how this infinity could fit the
                    <br />
                    description of an organism).
                    <br />
                <p>Whoops! I am sorry. It’s too long.
