<p>
The Top Ë Down approach has been used always by researchers and 
<br />
scholars as soon as they were interested in identifying the causality 
<br />
of one or another large problem, though their efforts have not been 
<br />
reported according to  this denomination, which is only a 
<br />
conventional title. At the dawn of the 21st century, this approach 
<br />
has become urgently  indispensable for comprehending the evolvement 
<br />
(quicker growth and faster aggravation) of each one of the problems 
<br />
that is generating the serious crisis that nowadays faces humankind.
<br />
<p>One of them is the warring that has determined de facto the 
<br />
controversial trajectory of the whole civilizing adventure. 
<br />
Bertalanffy commented in 1969:&quot;...Reason does not automatically lead 
<br />
to a solution of the human problem and, by and large, has little 
<br />
influence in the sanguinary course of human history,...&quot;
<br />
<p>In 1959 Lewis Mumford commented: &quot;At the time that the first great 
<br />
civilizations of the ancient world were coming into existence, the 
<br />
human race suffered an injury from which it has not yet recovered. 
<br />
... This injury happened at a moment when primitive man's powers... 
<br />
had suddenly expanded; and it was due essentially to ... a series of 
<br />
aberrations, which put his most beneficent inventions at the command 
<br />
of his neurotic anxieties. ..., this original injury has only 
<br />
tightened its hold upon the collective actions of tribes and nations. 
<br />
The aberration(s) is the institution of war.
<br />
<p>This early injury had an effect upon civilized life, somewhat 
<br />
comparable to the kind of childhood injury that psychiatrists 
<br />
characterize as a trauma: an injury whose worst results may not show 
<br />
themselves till far on in adult life. Instead of being buried in the 
<br />
psyche of an individual, it became embedded in the institutional life 
<br />
of every succeeding city, state, and empire.
<br />
<p>In an individual injured by &quot;...childhood misapprehensions, 
<br />
animosities, and resentments, childhood misinterpretations of natural 
<br />
events,... all account for the persistence of infantile patterns of 
<br />
conduct. Often, later in life, these patterns overcome the adult and 
<br />
leave him helpless. He still views present realities through the 
<br />
distorting glasses of his childhood fantasy&quot; This individual becomes 
<br />
&quot;unable to cope with the problems of his life, unable to make 
<br />
rational decisions, baffled, depressed, paralyzed, because he is 
<br />
still the prey of infantile fantasies he is unable to escape or 
<br />
control&quot; (Mumford, The Origins of War)
<br />
<p>It is improvable, said Mumford's , to recognize a parallel between 
<br />
the general human situation and that faced by an injured child who 
<br />
has grown  without being psychiatrically attended.
<br />
<p>Humans of one species or another have existed for more than 2 million 
<br />
years. modern humans are believed all to have descended from one 
<br />
woman ancestor about 250 millennia ago, probably in Africa. After 
<br />
being radically transformed the perspective of this species,  Homo 
<br />
sapiens when everywhere some women discovered how to invent 
<br />
agriculture around 10 millennia ago, soon people became good at 
<br />
cooperating based on the invented symbolic communication that help 
<br />
them to conceive and develop many diverse technologies. Every group 
<br />
fascinated by their words invented afterwards writing and learnt to 
<br />
use diversely their manual abilities in painting, sculpture, 
<br />
monuments and the building of walled cities.
<br />
<p>However, scarcity of food due to natural disasters and many fears and 
<br />
anxieties that emerged when the gradually developed human mind tried 
<br />
to comprehend how cosmic forces - sun, moon, the planets - and 
<br />
different terrestrial circumstances on whose manifestations all life 
<br />
depended led some minds to invent something else for justify their 
<br />
survival endeavors. Among these inventions theological explanations 
<br />
and human sacrifices for satisfying the needs of invented gods under 
<br />
the control of the all-powerful king as the secular ruler, the chief 
<br />
priest and even the living god became the civilizing circumstances. 
<br />
Those that determined the transformation of the disordered wild life 
<br />
of the barbarous humans in communities composed by instructed and 
<br />
disciplined people needed for organizing an efficient bureaucracy and 
<br />
a trained army and building major public works with forced labor 
<br />
either temporarily conscripted or permanently enslaved.
<br />
<p>Gradually it was necessary to institutionalize the war against other 
<br />
groups of people for recruiting new slaves and seizing enough 
<br />
captives for the human sacrifices in accordance with orders expressed 
<br />
by the king who personified the community as he assumed FULL 
<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LIFE AND WELFARE OF HIS SUBJECTS. Meanwhile 
<br />
every community could not avoid to search continuously a way forward 
<br />
while learning to be adaptive enough. The road created and followed 
<br />
by humans in order to civilize humankind was determined by numerous 
<br />
contradictory and conflicting Bottom  Ë Up approaches
<br />
<p>The Top Ë Down approach is intrinsic to human thinking but the large 
<br />
problems engendered by the controversial dynamics of many diverse 
<br />
irreconcilable interpretations of what the purpose of human life 
<br />
might be makes necessary to learn explicitly how to develop this road 
<br />
scientifically.
