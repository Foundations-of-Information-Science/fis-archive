<p>
Sorry, my Eudora has unexpectedly sent the previous unfinished message 
<br />
(either I have mistyped, or it did not like the contents). I continue:
<br />
<p>.. Then, David Bohm on 'paper-ing' may be misleading in spite of its 
<br />
elegance, because, yes, we can see all physical existentialities within an 
<br />
evolving and changing framework, but then the genuinely informational ones 
<br />
would do their changing and evolving differently: they couple inner 
<br />
productive processes of synthesis &amp; degradation of their structures to the 
<br />
arrival of external signals (and as a byproduct they also elaborate 
<br />
meanings) --cells would do it, and organisms, and nervous systems with 
<br />
their intrinsic coupling of learning/forgetfullness, and natural ecosystems 
<br />
too, and economic systems with their unending processes of adaptation and 
<br />
creative destruction a la Schumpeter...  I wonder whether something neatly 
<br />
informational, similar to Michael's theory of adaptability for organisms in 
<br />
ecosystems, would help us to make some advancement about the economic 
<br />
dynamics in our 'information' societies.
<br />
<p>Jerry's comments on my mention of the 'doctrine of limitation' need a very 
<br />
long response.  I can only say, very briefly, that the term --rather 
<br />
unassuming one-- belongs to one of Ortega y Gasset disciples (Julian 
<br />
Marias--his book about history of philosophy was translated into English 
<br />
and I believe circulated well--I think I got the English term from this 
<br />
source). The point I finally try to raise is that our contemporary system 
<br />
of knowledge has literally hundreds of scientific and technological 
<br />
disciplines. Obviously it reflects both our cognitive possibilities and 
<br />
limitations. The former are well studied, not so the latter. But actually, 
<br />
any interesting problem we face (remember the sonolumiscence case I 
<br />
mentioned weeks ago)  may bring us a dozen or two of related disciplines. 
<br />
Ted can tell something about that too, on the 'interdisciplinary costs' of 
<br />
big technological projects, in companies like Boeing, NASA, etc. The 
<br />
biggest cost is related to the painful process of 'decomposing' the big 
<br />
global problem into very small ones addressed towards a population of 
<br />
thousands of 'limited' specialized scientists and engineers.
<br />
<p>What I mean is very paradoxical. Challenged with the most serious problems 
<br />
that go far beyond the cognitive limits of any specialized knowledge, our 
<br />
scientific system has almost no 'doctrine' on how to combine and overlap 
<br />
the scores of scientific disciplines involved. Only pragmatics (&amp; pork 
<br />
barrel practices). Sustainable development is itself the best paradigmatic 
<br />
problem. It implies a series of intertwined problems of amazingly vast 
<br />
dimension: ecological, climate sciences, cultural, political, economic, 
<br />
engineering, thermodynamic, chemical, biological... Finally, the 
<br />
discussions we are having on a non-mechanistic conceptualization of info, 
<br />
may have some intriguing connection with that very social-cognitive problem 
<br />
--How sciences working as a collective nervous system may throw 
<br />
'anticipatory light' to overcome the impending menaces upon our planetary 
<br />
survival? In other words, we need to develop 'the art of socially playing 
<br />
with the Rubik cube of knowledge'. Our knowledge system has devoted 
<br />
countless scientific-philosophical energies to discussions on reductionism 
<br />
and the like, an almost nothing to 'integrationism', 'perspectivism', 
<br />
'limitation', etc. A mature info perspective (or science) could help, and 
<br />
should help,  to readdress the cognitive imbalance.
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro
