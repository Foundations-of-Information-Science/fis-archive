<p>
Michel,
<br />
<p>thank you for the invitation. I hope Pedro will not censure this too
<br />
heavily, as I already gave my suggestions on the most probable state of a
<br />
set less than a week ago.
<br />
<p>I look at a homeostatic system. It is neither dead (not changing its
<br />
parameters at all) nor mechanical (each and every step is predictable). It
<br />
has a momentary state (a temporal cross-section of describing it) and a
<br />
sequence of changes (a temporally longitudinal way of describing it) until
<br />
it achieves that state again which is more or less that same state it
<br />
started with.
<br />
Two questions arise:
<br />
a) how does the momentary state correspond to the sequence of steps until
<br />
the cycle or period is closed again;
<br />
b) how do states t1 (at the beginning of our description) and t2 (at the
<br />
end) match relative to each other?
<br />
ad b) In this phase of the FIS discussion I understand the main interest to
<br />
occupy with identity among two states of a system - how they are alike,
<br />
resemble each other or are identical (more or less). Like we consider two
<br />
processes and states of breathing (in and out, lungs filled or empty) as
<br />
extrema. Point b) discusses that one who has breathed out again is in the
<br />
same state as at the beginning of this cycle. We disregard at this approach
<br />
the he has become older and wiser and more tired and hungry or refreshed and
<br />
satisfied if he happens to sleep or to eat during our observation.
<br />
The terms of reference  need to be agreed on so that we can compare the
<br />
continuity, similarity, homogenity or identity of two states. Both states
<br />
deviate in minor respects to the idealised, average (&quot;entropic&quot;) state of
<br />
being completely full or empty of air. Each individual moment is in some
<br />
respects deviating to the idealised state (like any living family is in
<br />
deviation to the average, statistical family [which e.g. has 1.83 children
<br />
and earns 1216.5 Euros a month and lives in a flat of 66.3 m2]. No one
<br />
fulfills these expected values to the dot.)
<br />
<p>ad a) The concept of an idealised (most probable, entropic) state reappears
<br />
in the temporal journey between beginning and end of a period in the life of
<br />
a system too. There, in the analogy one would suppose the existence of an
<br />
ideally filled lung, of the ideal moment between breathing in and breathing
<br />
out, when the organism is ideally supplied. One sees that this concept is
<br />
a-biologic. Biology is the story about changes that lead to an identical
<br />
state.
<br />
Now, looking at a set to the elements of which arrive changes that cause the
<br />
state of the set to deviate and then to re-approach a collection of
<br />
measurement values (those we started out with), one idealises and simplifies
<br />
and formalises until one feels solid ground by having landed on natural
<br />
numbers.
<br />
The most common-sense, neutral and non-controversial set is that of the set
<br />
N. If we can't agree on 1,2,3,... then we can't agree on anything.
<br />
So we discuss natural numbers and their properties as descriptions of the
<br />
fragmentational state of a set. We use additions. The addition is a
<br />
description of the fragmentational state of a set.
<br />
This is a very basic approach. We break things up and look in how many
<br />
pieces the thing can be broken into and how the pieces are alike each other.
<br />
We observe that the number of pieces a set is most usually in (the number of
<br />
summands in an addition) and the size of the set (the result of the
<br />
addition) are of course interdependent (the bigger something is the more
<br />
pieces it can broken up into) but by far not so linear as one would have
<br />
thought. Following this chain of thought one comes to &quot;types&quot; or
<br />
&quot;archetypes&quot; of logical constants, out of which one can easily build highly
<br />
complex systems.
<br />
<p>Why is this number theoretical excursion relevant? Because the
<br />
fragmentational state of a set is a temporal cross-section, happens in the
<br />
moment. This we can compare to the sequence of steps it takes to arrive back
<br />
to the state we started out with. Then we understand the concepts of
<br />
&quot;consistency&quot;, &quot;concludent&quot;, &quot;resulting&quot;, &quot;dependent&quot;, &quot;predictable&quot;,
<br />
&quot;probable&quot; and &quot;certain&quot;.
<br />
You see that we use terminology of probability theory to describe basic
<br />
characteristics of a scientific argument or thesis: consistent, concludent,
<br />
resulting, dependent, predictable, probable and certain.
<br />
<p>Our thinking classifies our thoughts on probabilistic terms: &quot;this is a very
<br />
unlikely event&quot; is a polite way of saying &quot;nonsense&quot;. &quot;This is against all
<br />
experience&quot; puts all its faith into the consistency (predictability) of a
<br />
world outside and an observer inside that are both generating and collecting
<br />
matches betweeen expectations and realisations (I know what happens if I do
<br />
this). Normally, we expect our expectations to come true. We call something
<br />
chaos if we have no expectation and cannot predict what happens next. We
<br />
call something boring, monotonous, anancastic or stereotypical if it is too
<br />
much predictable, if we know at the onset what shall happen and when.
<br />
<p>Entropy is fascinating because it has so many forms. We ourselves are so
<br />
much in a rhythmic, periodic pattern that we do overlook the periodic,
<br />
cyclic nature of the system oscillating around or playing with entropy. I
<br />
believe that the key to understanding entropy lies beneath the aspect &quot;how
<br />
is it now&quot; (contemporal) and &quot;when shall it be again like this&quot; (sequential
<br />
description).
<br />
<p>I do like to discourse (pontificate) in great length and detail about
<br />
natural numbers and their relations among each other. This is a surprisingly
<br />
vivid lot. If you want to know more about how sets behave if (while) they
<br />
are linearised, do visit the homepage www.enumeration.net - it is in
<br />
shambles, but one can download 3 articles to the subject.
<br />
<p>Thanks for your interest.
<br />
Karl

<p>Great! Your opinion could enlight our discussions. What do you think ?
