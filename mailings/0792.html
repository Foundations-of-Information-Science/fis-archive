<p>
Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>Thanks to Edwina and Jerry for their positive comments on my message weeks 
<br />
ago about the counting problem in FIS. I'd like to answer Jerry's question 
<br />
which runs:
<br />
<p>&quot;Karl:  Is chemical and biochemical counting sufficiently complex to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;address your concerns about the nature of counting in FIS?  Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;correspondence with chemical counting a necessity for biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;counting?&quot;
</em><br />
<p>In my opinion, the entries in the periodic table of elements by Mendeleiev 
<br />
can well be regarded as entries into a multi-dimensional truth table. Now, 
<br />
which kind is the truth question to which these answers yield always .t. 
<br />
(true)?
<br />
<p>We presently have reason to assume that there exist about 104 
<br />
distinguishable kinds of logical .t. values, which are to be splitted up 
<br />
into some several hundred varieties, as each entry may have from 1 up to 
<br />
some dozen of equivalent forms (what the physicists call &quot;isotopes&quot;). The 
<br />
roughly 100 main archetypes of logical truths are subject to a manifold of 
<br />
logical relations. (there are some that cannot be present both at the same 
<br />
time--but it is another separate discussion).
<br />
<p>The entries into the above truth table have an intrinsic ordering principle 
<br />
which does not adhere strictly to their &quot;weight&quot;. This would be like saying 
<br />
that some subsets are similar to each other irrespective of their 
<br />
cardinality. Also, their building grammar appears to start at integer 
<br />
values of n=2i**2, with i = 1,2,3,... One may want to look into the 
<br />
generating function:
<br />
<p>Function m(n); local integer tmp, first, len, zero, m; tmp = int(sqrt(n/2));
<br />
first = 2*tmp**2; len = 4*tmp + 2; zero = if(n-first &lt; len/2, first + tmp,
<br />
first + len/2 + tmp); m = n - zero; return(m).
<br />
which gives one a &quot;long&quot; periodicity starting off at values of n=2i**2, with
<br />
half-periodicities included.
<br />
<p>Once one generates this recoding, there is lots to talk about, although it 
<br />
will be understood better what I means if I try to answer to the second 
<br />
question: &quot;what is the meaning of logical archetypes? Are chemical elements 
<br />
logical archetypes? If so, how?&quot;
<br />
<p>The general idea is that one builds (finds in the world) subsets made out 
<br />
of overlapping parts of other sets and looks into their distinguishing 
<br />
properties. This is a technique borrowed from opinion research and 
<br />
marketing. One builds the {consumer, buyer, listener, sick, interested, 
<br />
criminal, ...} subsets of the population regardless of the size of the city 
<br />
one investigates. Let us do a trivial exercise with hair-care marketing 
<br />
targets:
<br />
<p>Our product is good for {Red, brown, black, yellow, gray} hair color; 
<br />
{15-19,20-24,25-29,....,55-59} age brackets; {celibate, single, 
<br />
steady-going, true, philandering, promiscuous} sexual orientation; {brown, 
<br />
blue, black, green, mixed} eye colour; {black, yellow, red, pale, mixed} 
<br />
skin fabric.
<br />
<p>These categories cover the whole population and they are arranged in the 
<br />
order of falling frequencies. (That is, e.g. the eye colour is in the 
<br />
population like n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = n with n = 100% and n1 &gt;= n2 and 
<br />
n4 &gt;= n5 and all in between also.) Then we may reasonably say that the 
<br />
probability that one meets a person with a combination of any combinations 
<br />
of realisations from the categories is a virtual certainty. (There are no 
<br />
people in the city with age &lt;15 or 60+, and each one has one of the skin, 
<br />
eye, hair colours categories and sexual orientation. Each individual is 
<br />
fitting into one of the theoretically possible 5 * 9 * 6* 5 * 5 cells of a 
<br />
nice matrix. (5 hair, 9 age, 6 sex, 5 eye, 5 skin). The grand total in the 
<br />
right bottom corner will be n.
<br />
<p>What properties will the most probably met person (the person we shall meet 
<br />
most probably) have? If the attributes in the categories have been arranged 
<br />
in falling order of probability, this person shall be a red-haired, 17.5 
<br />
years old, celibate, brown-eyed, black-skinned hair-care-product target. 
<br />
The implicit logical statement about this person shall be: &quot;the set is a 
<br />
normal set&quot;, or &quot; I am a non-interesting logical occurrence, I represent 
<br />
but  the dull average&quot;.
<br />
<p>On the other hand, if we meet a series of black-haired, 35 years old, 
<br />
more-or-less faithful, black-eyed person of native American descent then we 
<br />
shall hear their implicit murmuring &quot;the set is containing bigger chunks 
<br />
than usual, you just don't meet them: you meet me, because the set is 
<br />
over-granulated. We come here in smaller groups. There is less of us but we 
<br />
come more around.&quot;
<br />
<p>In drawing-of-samples it helps to add to the Gauss distribution the Euler 
<br />
distribution which is hugely asymmetric. In my opinion, the Euler 
<br />
distribution is far more important than the Gauss one. With it, one finds a
<br />
extremely useful connection between &quot;size-of-set&quot;, &quot;number-of-chunks&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;size-of-chunk&quot;. (And of course also the other two ways around, too.) The 
<br />
Euler distribution is very simple and elegant, although shamefully 
<br />
neglected. Just chart the number of partitions into k summands for each n 
<br />
(1 graph per each number, k horizontally, f vertically) and then integrate 
<br />
with n -&gt; inf.
<br />
<p>Then, to speculate on whether there is a material 'constant' of which these 
<br />
logical chemical archetypes are built up (the second question we are trying 
<br />
to answer), one needs to generate the .2. set of partitions. Those for 
<br />
which sum(m(ni))=m(n). On these, one may start adding pairwise: those that 
<br />
fall down where .3. holds true, these converge. One does not know whether 
<br />
the left or the right half-periodicity is the right one and they differ 
<br />
ever so slightly. My hypothesis is that his type of simple partitional 
<br />
exercise, reminding a random walk, may serve quite well for making sense of 
<br />
the interactions between the atomic components (how neutrons, protons and 
<br />
electrons may add up to compose the multi-dimensional atomic truth table).
<br />
<p>I have had to condense quite a lot the 'partitional' maths involved. I hope 
<br />
that at least I have brought some further hints... and look forward to 
<br />
discussing these matters in more detail.
<br />
<p>Best
<br />
<p>Karl
