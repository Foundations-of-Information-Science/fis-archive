                    Dear Loet and colleagues,

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. You are changing the subject from &quot;social and cultural
                        complexity&quot; to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the nature of complexity&quot;.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus, our previous communications seem to be discardable as
                        &quot;irrelevant.&quot; ...
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't expect anybody to plea for imposing a system on human beings a la
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;marxism or fascism...
                    </em><br />
                <p>What about China, Cuba, North Corea? What about hundreds of millions in
                    <br />
                    Europe until less than a couple of decades ago? I restrain from making any
                    <br />
                    further comments about that, as when citizens were given the option, they
                    <br />
                    were quite eloquent. Your bland comments on Marx at the end (below), do not
                    <br />
                    match with the repeated claims of scientific predictability (and control)
                    <br />
                    inherent in dial. mat and hist. mat. doctrines (by himself, Engels, Lenin,
                    <br />
                    Stalin, Mao,etc. --posters with these figures are around the streets of
                    <br />
                    China yet; perhaps almost as a historical curio in that great country and
                    <br />
                    civilization).
                    <br />
                <p>In this sense, Marx was right: one creates society, but what happens is
                    <br />
                    beyond control because it is part of another dynamics. (His answers of the
                    <br />
                    possibility of a final reconciliation of these different dynamics was
                    <br />
                    perhaps a bit naive.)...
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not obvious that the human factor is the correct unit of analysis if
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;one is interested in social and cultural complexity. It is undoubtedly the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;right unit of analysis if one is interested in human complexity. However,

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;many phenomena which emerge on the basis of human (non-linear)

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;interactions cannot be reduced to the carriers.

                    </em><br />
                <p>Am afraid you have got interpretations alien to my own contents --or maybe
                    <br />
                    not-- for, as you know, the &quot;reduction&quot; theme is far away from my
                    <br />
                    approaches. In this regard, an aspect I particularly dislike is the
                    <br />
                    overabundance of a complex of thought we could dub as &quot;disciplinary
                    <br />
                    sufficiency&quot;. Just to add to the quarrel (I will make peace at the end!) I
                    <br />
                    quote from James' recent message: &quot;Leyton's methodology makes the structure
                    <br />
                    and emotional content of an artwork fully definable, rich, systematic and
                    <br />
                    complete.&quot; We can travel from discipline to discipline and hear similar
                    <br />
                    statements... one of the consequences is that similar over-reliances on
                    <br />
                    &quot;conceptualizations&quot; / &quot;mathematizations&quot;/ &quot;mechanizations&quot; etc. can
                    be
                    <br />
                    found under different guises in fields ranging from Artificial
                    <br />
                    Intelligence, Economics, Neuroscience, Molecular Biology, etc. I cannot
                    <br />
                    make now properly the point, but it is sort of an anxiety to present a well
                    <br />
                    complete, defendable view, the urge for a &quot;premature closure&quot; ... making
                    <br />
                    very difficult the multidisciplinary communication needed in almost any
                    <br />
                    realm of life.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example, a scientific paradigm (a la Kuhn) can be considered as a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;development of the pre-paradigmatic discourse into a more codified one.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The discourse becomes locked-in and then sets the delineations of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;relevant contributions to the discourse. Thus, human beings who were
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;previously important to this social/cultural system, are now no longer. As
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Planck seems to have said, one has to wait till the old boys have died.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not to deny that human beings are crucial as carriers of a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;socio-cultural system, but as the dynamics of the neural network are not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;determined at the level of the cells, but in terms of the wiring,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;analogously the dynamics of the networks of communications are not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessarily determined by the dynamics of the human carriers.
                    </em><br />
                <p>The particular example of the neural networks is not OK. For instance,
                    <br />
                    recent comparative studies between vertebrate and invertebrate synapses
                    <br />
                    have concluded that slightly altering the proteinaceous content of each
                    <br />
                    class of synapses modifies dramatically the dynamics of the overall
                    <br />
                    networks (eg, of learning), without implying any change in the
                    <br />
                    connectivity. In a few words, if you approach the dynamics of learning in a
                    <br />
                    biological nervous system, you cannot forget real neurons, glias,
                    <br />
                    neurotrophic factors etc. (not always, of course, and that's the
                    <br />
                    problem--paying due attention to the (&quot;probably&quot;) highly variable boundary
                    <br />
                    conditions.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Analytically, the human carriers are structurally coupled as the relevant
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;environment of the social system.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, it sounds nice to proclaim a humanistic a priori. However, as a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;system of communications the social can be studied as providing a dynamics
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;different and additional to human intentions. It is a different
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(sub)dynamic. For example, when one follows neo-evolutionary economics
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Schumpeter) in stating that innovations can upset the equilibrium seeking
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;tendencies in markets, we are discussing more abstract dynamics than can
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;be explained in terms of carriers (e.g., individual entrepreneurs).

                <p>I can agree with part of these ideas, and would like to connect with some
