<p>
Dear Enzo and All:
<br />
<p>First, thank you Enzo for your interesting post.  Unfortunately, 
<br />
other matters leave me little time for addressing the interesting 
<br />
issues raised here.  I look forward to the end of a very busy 
<br />
semester!  (Enzo's post is appended below.)
<br />
<p>In my original post, I sought to separate the functional behavior of 
<br />
an ecosystem into &quot;degrees of organization&quot;.  The mathematical / 
<br />
logic purpose for generating this separation of terminology was to 
<br />
distinguish the components of ecosystems into logical classes, 
<br />
somewhat analogous to the mathematical notion of a &quot;lattice&quot; 
<br />
structure.  By starting at the bottom of the &quot;lattice&quot; and moving 
<br />
stepwise upward, one starts with a very very fine structure, 
<br />
subatomic components, and step by step, increases the size and number 
<br />
of components of the next degree of informational assembly. Each 
<br />
assembly is formed from logical components of lower rank and each 
<br />
collection of lower assemblies forms logical assemblies of a higher 
<br />
order.
<br />
<p>The scientific languages for these operations are well established 
<br />
and supported by experimental methods (at the lower levels in the 
<br />
lattice) or empirical observations (for higher levels.)    These are 
<br />
discrete mathematical operations (that is, non-continuous) and are 
<br />
composed from indivisible components.
<br />
<p>The purpose for these constructions is give a representation that can 
<br />
be critically examined by scientific methods.  In other words, to 
<br />
develop the capacity to study the flow of individual &quot;bits&quot;  / 
<br />
&quot;units&quot; of information at each degree of organization within the 
<br />
lattice.  For my purposes, the study of human health and disease, a 
<br />
basic concern is the role of the individual structure in generating 
<br />
the dynamics of the whole.  The unique character of the individual 
<br />
assembly is vital to understanding the flows of information in the 
<br />
system as a whole.  In less abstract language, each biochemical 
<br />
structure represents an indivisible object.  Each biological gene 
<br />
represents a unique source of one component of the biological 
<br />
dynamics.   Each individual citizen represents a unique source of 
<br />
social action and inaction.  Each biological species contributes 
<br />
uniquely to the ecosystem.
<br />
<p>A lattice structure is reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive.  The 
<br />
&quot;lattice like&quot; structure I proposed is reflexive.  It is similar to 
<br />
the anti-symmetric property.  It is, in some senses, similar to the 
<br />
transitive property.
<br />
<p>By way of contrast, at this scale of coarse linguistic structure, 
<br />
thermodynamic functions are reflexive, symmetric and transitive, that 
<br />
is, thermodynamic functions are equivalence relations.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From the perspective of informational sciences, it appears that we 
<br />
need to identify operations or methods that allow one to bridge the 
<br />
relations between discrete systems composed from individuals and 
<br />
continuous systems that presuppose homogeneous populations.  A 
<br />
fundamental obstacle to communication between the physical and the 
<br />
biological sciences is the absence of such methods.  Within this 
<br />
framework I note that the logical structure of thermodynamics 
<br />
excludes the inclusion of chemical structures into the mathematics of 
<br />
thermodynamics.  Ratios of the numbers of each type or class of 
<br />
structure (equilibrium constants)  become the source of relation 
<br />
between the chemical sciences and the physics of heat.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Enzo that our basic view of nature must shift to an 
<br />
evolutive one.     For me, an evolutive view of nature requires 
<br />
inclusion of the specificity and sensitivity of assemblies of 
<br />
components.  Metaphorically speaking, the problems of describing 
<br />
information flow is similar in a cell, in a individual organism, or 
<br />
in a ecosystem - in all cases, a large numbers of distinctive 
<br />
processes are collaborating to sustain the system.  I believe that 
<br />
the source of the specific and sensitive behaviors of living systems 
<br />
must be accounted for in terms of the structure and behavior of 
<br />
individual components of perplex assemblies as these components and 
<br />
assemblies are the sources of informational flows.
<br />
<p>I hope to respond to some of the other posts in coming weeks.
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
<p>Jerry

<p><p><p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I apologize, I have sent you a not definitive draft of my considerations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the debate. Here follows the right version.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Best regards,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Enzo Tiezzi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;FIS Debate, Some observations, by Enzo Tiezzi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Constraints, Carrying capacity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The system in which we live, the planet Earth, is a finite system, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as such has constraints. Physical reality is therefore subject to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraints which determine limits. The term &quot;carrying capacity&quot; refers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the capacity of the planet to sustain a growing population. In these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;last years, the verb &quot;to carry&quot; has been replaced most of times with &quot;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sustain&quot; (implying duration in time) which gave rise to the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sustainable development.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The difference between the fast tempos of technological growth and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;slower tempos of the biological sphere, is at the core of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environmental crisis. To create a steady state of slow growth in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;society means maintaining the energy flux at a constant low level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;slowing the entropic process, favouring decentralization and the small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scale, using renewable resources.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Growth vs. development, Steady-state economics, Natural capital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To grow means &quot;to increase naturally in size by the addition of material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through assimilation or accretion&quot;. To develop means &quot;to expand or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realise the potentialities of; bring gradually to a full, greater or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better state&quot;. In short, growth is quantitative increase in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scale, while development is qualitative improvement or unfolding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;potentialities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The integration of economics, ecology and thermodynamics gives rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the new theory of ecological economics, or sustainability, which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing to do with that bad oxymoron &quot;sustainable growth&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We should adopt the biological model of steady state: evolution with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;minimum production of entropy and maximum thermodynamic efficiency. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;steady state in biology does not mean renouncing development. Natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;history is the history of biological evolution, of systems in continuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dynamic variation. The steady state does not negate evolution (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;development), it guarantees it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The two golden rules on which it is based are due to Herman Daly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I) harvest rates should be equal to regeneration rates (sustainable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yield);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;II) waste emission rates should be equal to the natural assimilative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;capacities of the ecosystems into which the wastes are emitted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Regenerative and assimilative capacities must be treated as natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;capital, and failure to maintain these capacities must be treated as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;capital consumption and therefore not sustainable. Natural capital and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;man-made capital are complementary and natural capital has become the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limiting factor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Calculations on natural capital (Nature, 387, 253-60, 1997) indicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the wealth produced by humans from nature is far greater then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;global gross national product.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) Thermodynamic foolishness: some considerations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thermodynamics' second principle, one of nature's fundamental laws,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addresses the pathways we should avoid in order to keep life on Earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It shows the universal, inescapable tendency toward disorder (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thermodynamics, the general trend toward a entropy maximum), which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also a loss of information and of usable energy availability. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tendency to the Clausius' &quot;thermal death&quot;, takes to the thermodynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equilibrium, namely the death of biological systems and ecosystems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through the destruction of diversities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are two ways to achieve such a condition:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a) when, through energy exchanges as heat fluxes, there are no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differences in temperature and nothing more can be done, because any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exchange of usable energy is allowed;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;b) when a system, becoming isolated, consumes its resources, reaching a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;great increase in its internal entropy and, at the end, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-destruction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For this reason living systems try to avoid the condition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thermodynamic equilibrium, keeping themselves as far as possible from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that state, self-organizing due to material and energetic fluxes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;received from outside and from systems with different conditions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;temperature and energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Economics and our society cannot be unaware of thermodynamics' second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle. As a consequence globalization, the destruction of both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biological and cultural diversities, homogenization and the unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought take inescapably to the thermal death (or to the &quot;entropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;euthanasia&quot;, as we called it), to the final destruction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the same way a country, a nation, a system that makes a political
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dogma of its isolation, of its refusing of cultural contamination
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(better: of cross-fertilizations), of its castling on fundamentalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;positions of self-conservation, will go to the same end. An excessive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defence of one's diversity and a complete loss of diversity are two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;faces of the same thermodynamic foolishness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) A new paradigm: from a space to a time culture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sustainable development needs the reformulation of some fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;premises of the western thought. A critique of contemporary science must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look for a transdisciplinar perspective, and be able to seek the basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elements of a multidimensional and multilfocused paradigm, in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fully describe the relations, quality and complexity of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The relationship between thermodynamics and sustainability is mainly due
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the attention that thermodynamics gives to the biophysical boundaries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that represent a constraint for the global environment. More
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specifically, sustainability finds a precious contribute in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ecodynamic models, which represent a synthesis between environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical chemistry and ecology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sustainability needs also to consider the anthropic presence as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subsystem of the whole biosphere, which can be assumed as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thermodynamic closed system, exchanging energy but not matter with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external sink (except a minimum dust or meteorite). Regarding every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human activity as a part of a whole system is a basic step for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evaluation of the carrying capacity of the Earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The most relevant scientific reference for sustainable development's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models is thermodynamics of far from equilibrium systems, studied by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ilya Prigogine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We can consider the whole biosphere as a closed system in steady-state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;far from equilibrium, in which a negentropic flow allows the creation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dissipative structures, complexity, new information, biodiversity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The switch to a vision of the interactions between man and nature as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex and non-linear system is a fundamental step, in order to abandon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the scientific reductionism that leads to abstract the single elements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the system from the context of its properties and that draws an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;oversimplified picture of nature (at the basis of the environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;crisis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The analysis of the evolution of a complex system underlines the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;essential role of the time's arrow, which becomes a basic point to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understood in the description of irreversibility. The reintroduction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the time dimension in the scientific understanding allows moreover the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;passage &quot;from a space to a time culture&quot;. Shifting our scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradigm from being to becoming means to find the link between the human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the natural sciences, as nature is considered no more like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unchangeable reality, isolated, ruled by deterministic and absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws, where human being is condemned to an always greater alienation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;once lost his original natural rootness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So we can find a scientific way for the elaboration of an alternative to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the positivistic reductionism that has evicted all those perceptive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elements that contribute to the knowledge but are not characterized by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the repeatability and quantifiability claimed by the hard sciences. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new paradigm for sciences should be an evolutive one. Dominant economic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory, based as it is on mechanistic principles, remains ignorant of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the law of entropy and the role of the time variable. The classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dynamic concept of time and its reversibility, has nothing to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality and nature. Time is not without its preferred directions (it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not isotropic) as is space. Time has a direction. Thermodynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;introduces &quot;knowledge of the unidirectional flow of time&quot;, traces the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limit between past reality and future uncertainty, indicates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;orientation of time in natural processes.
