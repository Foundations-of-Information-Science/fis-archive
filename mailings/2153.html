Dear Pedro,
<br />
<p>Somehow my post on the definition of information did not find its way into 
<br />
the FIS group. I am repeating it here in hope that you find it interesting 
<br />
enough to include. A little presentation on this subject, merely a joke, 
<br />
may be found at 
<br />
&lt;<a href="../../www.patronov.net/research/topics/diec.ppt">http://www.patronov.net/research/topics/diec.ppt</a>&gt;<a href="../../www.patronov.net/research/topics/diec.ppt">http://www.patronov.net/research/topics/diec.ppt</a> 
<br />
.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A definition of a concept is expression of its meaning through other
<br />
concepts. When we set up a logical system, some concepts have to be defined
<br />
axiomatically, and other are expressed throug them. Typically we all
<br />
(especially when we try to construct definitions) remain within the old
<br />
Marxist-Berkelian paradigm of material and ideal. For example the phrase
<br />
&quot;information is physical&quot; relates information to the matter, as physical and
<br />
material are, in fact synonims.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we try to build on the axiomatic definition of information
<br />
instead?Then
<br />
<p>Information is the primary entity of the world.
<br />
All the entities in the world are information entities. All the processes
<br />
are information processes.
<br />
Physical is the aspect of information perceptible sensually (i.e. through
<br />
vision, hearing, etc).
<br />
Ideal is the aspect of information  that is perceived rationally.
<br />
The material world is the totality of physical aspects of all information 
<br />
entities,
<br />
the material projection of information.
<br />
The ideal world is the world of ideas, the totality of ideal aspects of all
<br />
information entities.
<br />
Interaction never exists without conveying information (say, about the 
<br />
interacting objects)
<br />
Information is never transmitted without interaction.
<br />
<p>Example. A book is information entity. The paper and ink color, the feel of
<br />
the cover, etc are perceived directly via senses and are material aspects of
<br />
the book. The contents of the text, the ideas conveyed by the book, the
<br />
publisher's data are ideal aspects.
<br />
<p>It looks much more economic this way, as it turns out that matter is much
<br />
simpler to define through information than the other way around. Same with
<br />
ideal. And what is the &quot;Principle Question of Philosophy&quot; (of what is
<br />
primary - material or ideal) becomes perfectly dialectically eliminated in
<br />
the goegelian sense.
<br />
<p><p>If the answer is difficult then the question is wrong. Those who work with
<br />
physics know the problem of expanding a plane wave into spherical harmonics
<br />
as an example of converting a simple and clear object into a very complex
<br />
and obscure structure because of  wrong choice of basis.
<br />
<p><p>Yours sincerely,
<br />
<p>Igor Rojdestvenski

<br />
<p>Dear Hans and colleagues,
<br />
<p>I quite agree with the suggestion. Actually it dovetails with previous 
<br />
comments by Michel's, Soeren's and other parties. Maybe this advocacy on 
<br />
dedicated teamworkship is a sign of maturity in our common enterprise...
<br />
<p>In practical matters, let me suggest that you three (and a few others) 
<br />
could have some private exchanges on how to organize the task, at least 
<br />
during some initial steps.  Also, given that during the Paris conference 
<br />
there were informal conversations among some parties on launching a 
<br />
&quot;natural computer science&quot; team (and some other party was trying to promote 
<br />
a &quot;sustainable development&quot; team too), there seems to be the need to create 
<br />
a new platform, sort of a web log, to collectively lodge these potential 
<br />
projects. In a few weeks, the institute I am currently working in (I3A), 
<br />
will offer us one log platform for housing these tentative teams (at no 
<br />
cost). So, the present discussion list and the existing web pages, could 
<br />
have a nice and scholarly complement.
<br />
<p>Starting dedicated teamworkship, in whatever areas, may bring substantial 
<br />
advantages, if properly organized. Recently I have read about the need of 
<br />
three kinds of scientists: explorers, organizers, and administrators 
<br />
(institutionalists). Definitely, our band of &quot;lonely explorers&quot; has now 
<br />
crossed some threshold and needs some starting into those organization and 
<br />
institutionalization dimensions.
<br />
<p>all the best
<br />
<p>Pedro
