<br />
<p>Challenges Developed at ICC 2002
<br />
<p>Every day, the delegates developed challeges in their Friendship 
<br />
Groups, based on the day's theme: Water, Climate Change, Healthy 
<br />
Communities Healthy Children, and Resource Conservation. Two 
<br />
children, Justin Friesen of Canada and Analiz Vergara of Ecuador, 
<br />
were elected at the conference by their peers to attend the World 
<br />
Summit on Sustainable Development and deliver these challenges to the 
<br />
world leaders there. All the challenges are listed below.
<br />
<p><p><p>THE CHILDREN SPEAK
<br />
<p>All over the Earth, people want more food,  bigger houses, bigger 
<br />
cars, and more consumer goods. And yet with every bite we take, we 
<br />
take another bite out of nature.
<br />
<p>A new study by the California based Redefining Progress shows that 
<br />
humanity's demand for resources has soared during the past 40 years 
<br />
to a level where it will take the planet 1.2 years to regenerate what 
<br />
we remove each year. If Planet Earth was a corporation, we would have 
<br />
driven it into bankruptcy. And still we go on wanting more.
<br />
<p>At a time like this, where do we look to find leadership? To the 
<br />
Earth Summit, that's coming up this August? Maybe - but  we also need 
<br />
to look to our children. It is they who will inherit the mess we 
<br />
leave behind, and live with the scarcity, bewilderment, poverty and 
<br />
loss that we are causing.
<br />
<p>In May, 400 children aged 10 - 12 from around the world met in 
<br />
Victoria at the International Children's Conference on the 
<br />
Environment. At the end of the conference, they issued a challenge to 
<br />
the governments and the people of the world, which two of them will 
<br />
take to Johannesburg (see 
<br />
<a href="../../www.icccanada2002.org/challenges.html">http://www.iccCanada2002.org/challenges.html</a>).
