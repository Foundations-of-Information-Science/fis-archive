<p>
To Norbert, John, and Pedro:
<br />
<p>First, Norbert, I was puzzled by the content of your message of Sept. 11.
<br />
You provide &quot;Answers&quot; but I am uncertain what the propositions were.
<br />
Later, I recognized that the remarks you attributed to Ted were not 
<br />
written by Ted.  As this has happened before, I ask that you take 
<br />
extra precautions in the future to ensure that you are quoting your 
<br />
colleagues correctly.  Your contributions to the community of FIS 
<br />
could become even more valuable.
<br />
<p>John: you write:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no empirical evidence for a logically necessary link 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between 'information' and
</em><br />
data, knowledge or truth or for the instantiation of 'information' in rational
<br />
processes (or computing). An informational experience is notoriously 
<br />
good or bad
<br />
according to its perceived usefulness not its logicality. &lt;
<br />
<p>In general, scientific thought operates on empirical information. 
<br />
The source of empirical information is a specific system and a 
<br />
specific set of circumstances.   The design, planning and conduct of 
<br />
scientific operations are grounded in one-to-one correspondence 
<br />
relations, although this ideal is often impossible to realize in 
<br />
practise.  The relations between mathematics  and science are also 
<br />
grounded in correspondence relations.  If a coherent structure is 
<br />
proposed, then the structure is subject to explanation on these 
<br />
bases.   These bases also serve to either generate a wide acceptance 
<br />
of the structure or a general rejection of the proposed structure, 
<br />
depending on the acceptance or rejection of correspondence relations.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It is crucial to distinguish between empirical information with 
<br />
supporting correspondence relations and (philosophical) abstractions 
<br />
about nature.  Your usage of general terms suggests to me that you 
<br />
are speaking in terms of your personal philosophy and what you 
<br />
consider to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; based on utilitarian axia.
<br />
<p>The abstractions of science fiction stimulate our capabilities to 
<br />
image nature, but such abstractions must be recognized as 
<br />
non-empirical.
<br />
Or, have I missed your intended communication?
<br />
<p>John:  You further write:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My personal theory (at the risk of spamming the conversation) is that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(and possibly all living organisms) qua species informationis relate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to each other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and to the Umwelt cinematically rather than computationally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We pan towards meaning, focus empathetically or zoom in and out of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conversations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Informational experiences provide us with 'shots' which make varying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;degrees of sense.
</em><br />
<p>To me, the view of biology implied by your sentences seems to be at 
<br />
least a century out of date.
<br />
More than three centuries ago, the invention of the microscope 
<br />
revealed a microscopic world that was beyond the normal range of 
<br />
human sensory systems.
<br />
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the science of chemistry revealed 
<br />
microscopic structures of natural systems.  In some cases, these 
<br />
structures could be added together to generate human sensory 
<br />
experience - for example, the taste of tartaric acid or the taste of 
<br />
vinegar could be related to the quality of wine.  Modern science 
<br />
continues to exploit the realization that a microscopic world at the 
<br />
nanoscale can be directed related to human experience.  Many of the 
<br />
modern practises of medicine are directly related to relations among 
<br />
atomic elements (as composed into molecules) at the nanoscale.
<br />
<p>While I also am puzzled about the nature of conscious human 
<br />
experience, I do not think it is the sole basis of human experience 
<br />
and it alone is not sufficient to construct a basis for communication 
<br />
of information.  If one wants to construct a coherent view of nature, 
<br />
it is essential to identify the complex sets of correspondence 
<br />
relations that links the range of human senses to the extraordinary 
<br />
capabilities and fantastic dynamic and spatial ranges of human 
<br />
artifacts (instrumentations) to detect the &quot;invisible&quot; communications 
<br />
intrinsic to the complexities of nature.
<br />
<p>Pedro:  I concur with most of your recent post.  At the base, we need 
<br />
generating functions that support natural language.  I strongly agree 
<br />
that interdisciplinary confusion is a very deep problem that will 
<br />
endure for many generations. Interdisciplinary communication may be 
<br />
the most intractable problem facing FIS.
<br />
<p>Perhaps you could expand on what you mean by:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Helas, a central problem that also impinges in my previous comments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(above) on logics is the lack of a central theory of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurosciences, really making sense of the dynamics of our cognition.
</em><br />
<p>Another colleague used language similar to yours in a lecture 
<br />
recently.  I  guess I am either missing the point or that my 
<br />
philosophy of biology has become so radical that I am inadvertently 
<br />
excluding your line of reasoning.  Could to identify more 
<br />
specifically what a &quot;central theory of the neurosciences&quot; would 
<br />
contribute to our knowledge of communications?
<br />
<p><p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You wrote:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;My point was that most workers in logic have many different logics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;All are invented for different purposes and distort the reality they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;represent and about which they reason.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree that 'logics' are legion. The distortion occurs in the expression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(language) and in the rational process (thought). The corollary is that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information may be in fact misinformation (distortion of reality)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be it the myth of Oedipus, Seven Day Creationism or Superstring theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Remember that old trickster Hermes is the patron god of libraries 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and messengers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The flow of information (like the arrow of time) is an illusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no empirical evidence for a logically necessary link

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;We are talking about...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;4. How the entities involved &quot;express and reason about how things work&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I support your emphasis on what information (and its conceptual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;family) does rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than what it speculatively is or means. An example might be the way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Don Norman picked up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on JJ Gibson's notion of affordance and incorporated it into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;practice of computer design.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Our first task is to identify the substratum of supervenient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entities with family resemblances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to our long lost cousin information rather than attempt to formulate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a reductionist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Grand Unifying Theory. Intelligent fragmentation of views is inevitable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As an aside how do you incorporate into your Fourth Domain non-linear concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like turbulence, rhythmic entrainment, dynamic coherence, affordance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and agility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- all those intriguing mental models which have emerged in recent times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to enhance and develop (but not overthrow) First Order Logic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do we ground expression/reason in 'how things work'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do we make moves on the chessboard if we are the pieces in the game?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First Order Logic is like the notation on the scoresheet of a previous match -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good for postgame analysis but not for mate in two. Peircean anthropo-logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only gets us partially into informational relationships (say through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the opening gambits not into the intuitive middle-game).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My personal theory (at the risk of spamming the conversation) is that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(and possibly all living organisms) qua species informationis relate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to each other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and to the Umwelt cinematically rather than computationally.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Informational experiences provide us with 'shots' which make varying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;degrees of sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I'm not misinformed, the emergence of the camera both reflects and furthers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the epistemiologic development of homo sapiens. Computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;posthumanism (Fredkin, Hayles)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is really digital reductionism and we cannot unravel the plot of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by categorical logic or semantics alone.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is really have some difficulty to understand how we can think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;logic&quot; is a (narrow) human invention!!!????
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fenzl--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(My second posting this week. Limiting to two seems a good rule.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We are talking about four domains here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--1. How things actually work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--2. How things appear to work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--3. How we express and reason about how things work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--4. How the entities involved &quot;express and reason about how things work&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Edwina used the term &quot;logic&quot; in the context of Socratic caves,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aristotle and Peirce. She used terms like &quot;rational&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;reasonable.&quot; To my mind (and many I presume) her use of the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;puts her use in domain 3. My point was that most workers in logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have many different logics. All are invented for different purposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and distort the reality they represent and about which they reason.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You used the term &quot;logic&quot; in such a way that means (I think) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is some coherent set of laws in domain 1 that result in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reproducable effects. That's different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As common terms of art in computer science, I use &quot;mechanics&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;physics&quot; for domain 1, and &quot;logic&quot; variously for the rest. I believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is a large distance of abstraction among these four. Edwina at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least believes 2 and 1 are the same or close and &quot;logic&quot; covers both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Whatever you choose is a religious decision, but there are tens of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thousands of places where you can recount what people said about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the relationships among 1, 2 and 3. I suppose it has pedagogical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;value, but that Christmas tree is pretty well decorated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I interpret the FIS to agenda to be concerned with domain 4 and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships with the others. There are very few forums for this, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suppose the focus here to be worth preserving.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can even claim some small role in &quot;creating&quot; a logic myself. Twenty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;years ago a problem somewhat similar to the FIS one was defined in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terms of the restrictions of existing logics. We specified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characteristics of a new logic to design, and essentially established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a research center to do so. I played a minor role in the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identification and arranging the funding. The center is still strong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at Stanford. The project was led by our probably greatest living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logician at the time (who died last year). The logic is &quot;situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic,&quot; which at his death was being extended to &quot;channel logic&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;address something much like domain 4.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Whatever we invent, it will likely be algebra-friendly and exploit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;group theory. The route of abstraction among the four domains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(especially 3 and 4) must be formally specified; I am hopeful that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;category theory will guide that.
