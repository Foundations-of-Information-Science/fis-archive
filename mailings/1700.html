<p>
Some random thoughts:
<br />
<p>1. Independent reinvention: another path to consilience
<br />
<p>Two years ago, I have been trying to solve a particular problem in machine
<br />
learning, my field of research. Looking around, I found a particular
<br />
generalization of mutual information, which was constructed by my colleague.
<br />
I performed numerous experiments, and it performed well. Then I tried to
<br />
check if anyone thought of that before, and, empowered by Google, I was
<br />
surprised to find virtually the same formula (re)invented independently with
<br />
different names over the past 50 years in: biology (Quastler), psychology
<br />
(McGill), information theory (Han, Yeung), physics (Kikuchi,Cerf&amp;Adami
<br />
arXiv:quant-ph/9605002), neuroscience (Brenner), robotics (Yairi et al), and
<br />
closely related notions in game theory (Grabisch &amp; Roubens), complexity
<br />
theory (Gell-Mann), statistics (Darroch), and chemistry (Kirkwood). I could
<br />
go on, but I wonder how many I already missed.  Most researchers, but not
<br />
all, arrived at it by employing the inclusion-exclusion principle outside of
<br />
strict context of set theory. That was my encounter with consilience: but it
<br />
was not a discovery of applicability of a different method in an unexpected
<br />
domain, but the independent discovery of the same hypothesis (actually a
<br />
tool) in a number of different domains: isn't this the same. 
<br />
<p><p>2. Hierarchies of sciences
<br />
<p>Perhaps that is demonstration enough that vertical integration is beneficial
<br />
if not necessary. And here come in Pedro's diagrams of sciences. I do not
<br />
see a need for politically correct circularity. I also agree with the
<br />
optimistic viewpoint that there needs to be only a single vertical field
<br />
that provides the cognitive &quot;tools&quot; (which are, however, psychologically
<br />
feasible) to all the horizontal fields. Role models already exist: logic,
<br />
mathematics and statistics (and philosophy that studies their foundations). 
<br />
<p>As a side note, I found Pedro's reference to circle of knowledge very
<br />
interesting. There, religion and philosophy are in the center. Where is
<br />
religion today? While philosophy sets the framework for what and how to
<br />
think, religion answers the Why?. While some people could involve in the
<br />
infinite regress of why why why, most stop recursing at a certain level and
<br />
move forward. Religion is a formal setting of this direction, combining with
<br />
the informal herding behavior. Ultimately the quality of this direction is
<br />
judged by survival and growth of both the religion and its followers.
<br />
<p><p>3. Objects reified
<br />
<p>Mathematics and logic, for one, have been cast in stone. Nobody dares
<br />
question the fundamentals anymore, it would be unimaginable throwing all
<br />
that away. This seems like a proof of Stan's senescence. Mathematics and
<br />
logic are all discrete, based on objects and their behavior. Probability
<br />
theory, too, is discrete, with the division of the universe into discrete
<br />
events. And without probability theory, there is no statistical notions of
<br />
information or entropy. If you now look at the natural world, you don't see
<br />
objects: you see the fuzz of interlocking leaves, the swaying fur of grass,
<br />
the smooth gusting of wind, swarming of flies, the gritty mess of mud, soil
<br />
and pebbles on the ground, the swirling stream, the foamy foam.
<br />
<p>Then you turn and look at a urban landscape: objects (discrete buildings),
<br />
objects (discrete chair), objects (discrete road-side signs), objects
<br />
(discrete potted plants), objects (discrete buttons), objects (discrete
<br />
humans), objects (discrete molecules of air), objects (discrete plant
<br />
species), objects (discrete knots of wind speed), objects (centimeters of
<br />
leaf surface area), objects (zeros and ones encoding the music on a CD),
<br />
pummeling of photons, cascading of electrons. We don't know what there is
<br />
inside an atom, but surely it's objects, and objects within them. Computers
<br />
are engineered so that everything is fully deterministic and predictable,
<br />
and there is nothing that is not an unnested discrete binary object, all
<br />
equal, all egalitarian.
<br />
<p>We're trying to fit every aspect of nature to objects and to relationships
<br />
between them. The problems we have with concepts like continuity (what is
<br />
infinity? what is zero? what is divide-by-zero?), forces, fields,
<br />
relationships and interactions (are two particles interacting at a distance,
<br />
or are they really a single object? is a molecule of my body an independent
<br />
molecule or is it my body?) are a kludge retrofitted on objects that tries
<br />
to capture everything that objects alone miss. Indeed, our representations
<br />
have senesced, and all we will ever do will be in the context of objects.
<br />
*Can* we think in some other way than by reifying objects, or has our
<br />
cognition senesced a long time ago? If computers don't, do we still have the
<br />
freedom to think in non-objects? Fuzzy logic is not an answer: every fuzzy
<br />
variable is still an object: either it's hot or it is not, two values, two
<br />
objects. Just as in logic, a hypothesis is either perfectly true or
<br />
perfectly false.
<br />
<p>You might wonder for a few seconds, perhaps admit it, but you would
<br />
certainly not want to work in this direction. Life's too short and that's
<br />
senescence.
<br />
