Market Watch Special Alert achieved record results for 
<br />
our Investment Alert for the First Quarter of 2004. 
<br />
Our subscribers have pocketed huge gains by revealing 
<br />
unknown and undervalued gems thrust into the spotlight.
<br />
<p>Results for our First Quarter Investor Alert issued in 
<br />
December 2003:
<br />
Company Recommended: Torvec, Inc. (TOVC)
<br />
Price when recommended: 1.45
<br />
Highest price reached: 8.99 (+520%)
<br />
<p>Second Quarter Investment Alert:
<br />
Deer Park Technology, Inc. (DRPT)
<br />
<p>Price: .41
<br />
<p>Assets: over 18 Million (2.09 per share)
<br />
Est. 2004 EPS: .15 Growth 300%+
<br />
Shares Out: 8.6 million
<br />
Float: 1.7 million
<br />
Average PE: Industry 23-25
<br />
<p>Put DRPT on your radar for the purpose of immediate 
<br />
investment. Merger completed with 10-year old 
<br />
&quot;entertainment empire&quot;. Name change imminent to reflect 
<br />
a treasure-trove of entertainment media properties.
<br />
<p>Stock Performance Guide: DRPT
<br />
7 day trading target: 1.20
<br />
30 day trading target: 2.50
<br />
12-Month Est. Average PE X 2004 EPS = 3.75
<br />
<p>One glance inside DRPT's programming vault will make you 
<br />
realize that there is basically none of the Company's 
<br />
intrinsic value reflected in the price of the stock. 
<br />
This is a direct result of a stock that is completely 
<br />
unknown to investors. Watch how quickly prices roar when 
<br />
word spreads, investors grab their calculators, and the 
<br />
realization is clear that this stock is trading for just 
<br />
pennies on every dollar of tangible assets.
<br />
<p>The value of the Company's core assets will force its way 
<br />
into the stock price, with this explosive entity stepping 
<br />
into the spotlight and evolving DRPT into Media Classics 
<br />
International, Inc. Although a new name to investors, Media 
<br />
Classics is a major video stock footage company with 
<br />
worldwide distribution that has amassed a 3,000 film product 
<br />
line since 1994.
<br />
<p>An overview of Media Classics' holdings reveals a tremendous 
<br />
diversity of entertainment media, started from scratch about 
<br />
ten years ago that has subsequently morphed into an almost 
<br />
$20 Million asset empire with top award winning producers 
<br />
and directors at the helm. 
<br />
<p>The Company's entertainment assets are comprised of over 
<br />
2,400 hours of stock film footage, documentary and educational 
<br />
films, over $8 Million of animated art and programming, 
<br />
distribution rights for 110 full-length feature films 
<br />
categorized as top box office draws starring Oscar winners 
<br />
and a who's-who of Hollywood actors, as well as sports 
<br />
programming, and music rights. This complete library is 
<br />
distributed worldwide in VHS, DVD, on cable television and 
<br />
via the Internet, and is a continuing source of rapidly 
<br />
growing revenues. 
<br />
<p>Several recent news announcements are well-timed with the 
<br />
upcoming corporate name change and will add significant 
<br />
value to a growing bottom line. These releases include:
<br />
1. The licensing of 36 films for distribution as DVD's 
<br />
and home video through a group of entertainment companies.
<br />
2. The completion of ten (10) documentaries to be released 
<br />
within 60 days produced as a joint venture with well-
<br />
known Terramar Productions.
<br />
3. A contract to provide entertainment products to the US 
<br />
Navy for use on board ship and at Navy bases around the globe. 
<br />
<p>Here are some figures that put into perspective the enormous 
<br />
potential revenues that are available to industry players 
<br />
with diverse entertainment properties. The movie industry 
<br />
generates $150 Billion while the entire music industry 
<br />
yields $30 Billion worldwide. Video rentals in the US totaled 
<br />
$7 Billion, video sales reached $10 Billion, and DVD sales 
<br />
totaled $4 Billion for a total of $21 Billion in post-theatrical 
<br />
gross profits. With 50% of the wholesale price of a DVD or 
<br />
VHS going to the producer or studio, it is clear to aggressive 
<br />
investors why DRPT (Media Classics) has become our #1 stock 
<br />
pick for 2004.
