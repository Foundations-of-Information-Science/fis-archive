<p>
At present, at the dawn of the so-called 3rd millennium, most humans 
<br />
are scarcely aware of the worst crisis ever faced by humankind due to 
<br />
the prevalent decision making that aims at making sustainable the 
<br />
assumed achievements of the Western Civilization, whose trends are 
<br />
already frankly unsustainable. In this year 2002, after the happening 
<br />
of the regrettable &quot;11 September 2001&quot; it has been extensively argued 
<br />
by some powerful decision makers that this civilization must be 
<br />
defended by means of war supported by very modern weapons created 
<br />
through superb technological innovations and continuous scientific 
<br />
work.
<br />
<p>Very few enlightened humans have frankly and explicitly recognized 
<br />
that so far, in a large measure, this civilization has first of all 
<br />
intended to assure the submission of masses of people - with the 
<br />
support of various particular kinds of religious interpretations of 
<br />
the terrestrial reality - learning to be human resources, therefore 
<br />
loyal, obedient, disciplined,... being, each one willing to be 
<br />
serviceable during his/her whole life, in accordance with civilized 
<br />
regulations produced by their owners: the members of the highly 
<br />
civilized society.
<br />
<p>These two questions merit a deep and extended reflection, because 
<br />
nowadays, the vast majority of societal systems constituted 
<br />
everywhere and maintained in operation  (necessarily in accordance 
<br />
with various cultural peculiarities that people have been well 
<br />
induced to accept) are today unavoidably confronted to an enormous 
<br />
diversity of larger social, economic, political and cultural problems 
<br />
generated as side effects by intelligent actions that have been 
<br />
structured and fulfilled by clever humans in order to maintain the 
<br />
civilizing trends. Such a contradiction between the rational 
<br />
potentiality of human performances and the illogical, nonsensical 
<br />
and/or foolish results that are indirectly producing the actions 
<br />
performed must therefore be attributed to the preponderant decision 
<br />
making, which is determined through narrow minded and shortsighted 
<br />
criteria conceived in practice for making sustainable what the same 
<br />
criteria contributed to make unsustainable
<br />
<p>One of the main contributions made by Ludwig von Bertalanffy is the 
<br />
conceptual model of the living organism as an open system, which 
<br />
means that it may be seen as an entity continuously interacting with 
<br />
its environment, in order to maintain their living features in 
<br />
operation. Based on this concept it becomes evidently possible for 
<br />
every human being to be increasingly aware about the convenience of 
<br />
continuously learning to maintain his/her surroundings (environment) 
<br />
as proper as possible in order to reduce the risks of being seriously 
<br />
disturbed his/her performance due to unsuitable biological 
<br />
conditions, inappropriate social circumstances and/or erroneous 
<br />
pseudo-cultural values. Therefore it can be claimed that every human 
<br />
may systematically increase the chances of his/her physiological, 
<br />
psychological and intellectual survival learning to maintain his/her 
<br />
environment comme il faut.
<br />
<p>As most human beings are living with other human beings in societal 
<br />
surroundings it can be argued that all humans must indeed maintain 
<br />
their surroundings in proper conditions as needed for a continuous 
<br />
betterment of human life. Consequently the terrestrial environments, 
<br />
where the human communities and societies  are located, can and 
<br />
should as well be maintained as open systems in order to increase the 
<br />
survival chances of the human species, presumably involved in the 
<br />
manifestation of civilizing processes.
<br />
<p>It could be assumed that each one of the 76 texts selected for being 
<br />
published by SAGE as &quot;Systems Thinking&quot; was structured de facto under 
<br />
the influence of the biased assumption of every author who considered 
<br />
that its content was relatively enough for helping to maintain the 
<br />
functionality of our magnificent civilization.
<br />
<p>These texts necessarily arose from ideas that were conceived in 
<br />
diverse circumstances by a mind who no doubt intended, inevitably 
<br />
according to his/her personal possibilities,concerns, motivations, 
<br />
commitments,... to deal with one or another or even several of the 
<br />
social and/or economic incongruities - mainly those generated by 
<br />
narrow minded or shortsighted ideologies - that during the last five 
<br />
decades have been causing the emergence of many more and larger 
<br />
problems.
<br />
<p>Evidently the kind of Systems Thinking and Cybernetic Interrelations 
<br />
that are employed for tackling these problems appear as valuable 
<br />
methodological achievements. Therefore usually these contributions 
<br />
can be exclusively applied in the domain of idealized or simplified 
<br />
circumstances. Meanwhile many local, regional and global problems 
<br />
continuously grow and many of them are in fact reaching a crisis 
<br />
point.
<br />
<p>It may sound dramatic but nowadays societal, cultural, economic and 
<br />
political affairs all over the world continuously deteriorate despite 
<br />
Systems and Cybernetics. Fortunately it is not yet an irreversible 
<br />
tragic moment because both are still very young intellectual 
<br />
concerns, which are simply requiring to be developed for coping with 
<br />
the problems that faces humankind at present being composed by more 
<br />
than 6,000 million people
<br />
<p>However such a development makes necessary first of all the proper 
<br />
implementation of the Bertalanffian Systems Thinking through Top Ë 
<br />
Down approaches which are indispensable in order to comprehend 
<br />
holistically the human affairs and concerns. This proposal made by 
<br />
Bertalanffy is considered a very difficult task (impossible for those 
<br />
System Thinkers who simply reject the Top ==&gt; Down approach arguing 
<br />
that this holistic alternative is an oxymoron, as they claim that 
<br />
they know that there is no Top.
<br />
<p>Knowing that such objection arises basically due to the way the 
<br />
systems movement has evolved, it seems convenient to guide the 
<br />
development of SYSTEMS THINKING supported by ideas expressed by 
<br />
Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Anatol Rapoport several decades ago:
<br />
<p>&quot;Bertalanffy advocated that we dare to broaden our loyalty from 
<br />
nation to globe. He urged that we become patriots of the planet, 
<br />
endeavoring to think and act primarily as members of humanity. 
<br />
Without necessarily diluting our own individual and cultural 
<br />
identity, he said, we must begin protecting the individual and 
<br />
cultural identity of others. He urged that we begin pledging our 
<br />
allegiance to humanity and to the earth on which we stand, one planet 
<br />
indivisible or not planet at all.(*)
<br />
<p>&quot;Confronted with a variety of competing ideologies and value-systems, 
<br />
the scientist. in order to be consistent with himself, cannot remain 
<br />
neutral. As Dr. Anatol Rapoport says, &quot;different men want to go in 
<br />
different directions, and some of these directions are incompatible 
<br />
with the direction inherent in science itself &quot; Therefore, &quot;the 
<br />
scientist must subscribe to certain values (and discard others) not 
<br />
because he is a 'good citizen' or a product of a [particular] culture 
<br />
or a member of a [particular] church, but because he is a scientist&quot; 
<br />
(#)
<br />
<p>The development of CYBERNETICS from now onward should be basically 
<br />
oriented by the need of humans requiring societal systems locally 
<br />
attached, regionally committed and globally engaged
<br />
in order to be humanely functional
