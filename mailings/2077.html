                <p>
                    Loet stresses that the mathematics of information can be applied to
                    <br />
                    conceptualize anything. This notion also appears in Pedro's separation
                    <br />
                    of information as parallel to the scalar levels of reality. Rafael
                    <br />
                    reminds us of &quot;being inside&quot;, with many interesting references. Pedro
                    <br />
                    makes a beautiful example of energetic value vs psychological value.
                    <br />
                <p>I think these issues pinpoint the relation between physics and
                    <br />
                    information. The &quot;systemic&quot; perspective tried to propose metaphors of
                    <br />
                    reality: where is the information in this reality? But there is a
                    <br />
                    parallel world of information, and it can be studied for its own sake.
                    <br />
                <p>I will now try to apply some Aristotelian analogies to information,
                    <br />
                    attempting to define it. The central element is &quot;model&quot;, and there are
                    <br />
                    four causes to it. My &quot;model&quot; roughly corresponds to the notion of the
                    <br />
                    Sign in semiotics. I think this representation may help illuminate some
                    <br />
                    of the meta-level disagreements in the recent discussion, and perhaps
                    <br />
                    reconcile the informational stream and the physicalist stream of
                    <br />
                    thought. These two streams merely focus at two different aspects of the
                    <br />
                    same thing: they don't exclude one another.
                    <br />
                <p>1. The constructs the thoughts are made of (the materiality of language,
                    <br />
                    the building blocks of information)

                <p>In Mongolia the &quot;currency&quot; used to be chunks of dry blood: you could eat
                    <br />
                    it in cases of emergency - so fuel can be currency. In the very old days
                    <br />
                    in Europe the currency were chunks of bronze that you could convert into
                    <br />
                    swords and those you could wield to obtain food. The currency a flower
                    <br />
                    pays the bee is glucose. If you trace back the origins of currency, you
                    <br />
                    arrive at fuel. If you trace back the origins of fuel, you arrive at
                    <br />
                    energy. Pedro is right in saying that the thread is overstretched, but
                    <br />
                    it's still a thread. The beginnings and the endings are lost in a blur
                    <br />
                    of vagueness in becoming and ending. When is it currency and no longer
                    <br />
                    fuel? When does a chicken stop being an egg? When is the egg no longer a
                    <br />
                    part of the chicken?
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;Becoming&quot; and &quot;ending&quot; are a reflection of the &quot;path&quot; metaphor that
                    <br />
                    Lakoff and Nunez wrote about (as Terry reminded us last year). We wield
                    <br />
                    these metaphors to comprehend the world. But the actuality of the world
                    <br />
                    is not made of beginnings and endings. Our *understanding* of the
                    <br />
                    reality of the world is made of beginnings and endings. Beginnings and
                    <br />
                    endings are the crayons we use to draw our mental maps.

                <p>I think &quot;information&quot; in the context of FIS is the discussion of
                    <br />
                    metaphors the knowledge is built from, the structure of knowledge.
                    <br />
                    Shannon information is one of those metaphors. Probability is yet
                    <br />
                    another metaphor. Both of them rest on the kind of foundations of
                    <br />
                    ennumeration that Karl often mentions. Igor and Bob speak of network and
                    <br />
                    autocatalysis metaphors. Stan upholds the hierarchical metaphors.
                    <br />
                <p>What metaphors are there? Can we build a dictionary of them? Can we
                    <br />
                    build a grammar of them?

                    </em><br />
                <p>Our minds and computers are all connected. Thoughts jump around, build
                    <br />
                    up, collapse and flow. Symbols are made, forgotten, mapped and matched.
                    <br />
                    Sometimes the realities thus constructed are well-connected to the
                    <br />
                    unknown and often unknowable actualities below. A mental image of a
                    <br />
                    castle perched on the cliff is matched by an actual pile of rock. A
                    <br />
                    mental image of a castle on a cloud in the sky is not matched by any data.
                    <br />
                <p>So, our minds construct all sorts of ideas. Some ideas are grounded in
                    <br />
                    energetic reality down below, and some ideas are pies in the sky. Just
                    <br />
                    as the wind can twist and heat the air to no avail, the same wind can
                    <br />
                    blow a house away. Some ideas productively modify humanity, and some
                    <br />
                    ideas make the humanity turn in aimless circles.
                    <br />
                <p>We can thus examine how the parallel world of representations looks like
                    <br />
                    (formal). We can think about what the representations are made of
                    <br />
                    (material). We can study our minds that host and nurture the information
                    <br />
                    (efficient). And we can wonder about the purpose of the information
                    <br />
                    (final). Do these four causes define information science? Am I myopic in
                    <br />
                    my thinking that &quot;information science&quot; is the study of models?
                    <br />
                <p>No wonder that Pedro and others find systemic views reductionist: they
                    <br />
                    indeed focus primarily on the efficient cause of information (where is
                    <br />
                    information, what causes it?). Sometimes we look at the final cause of
                    <br />
                    information (what is information good for? will it sustain itself?)
                    <br />
                <p>So, if there is information in a cell: (formal, structure) What is it
                    <br />
                    like? What does it mean? (material, elements) What is it made of? What
                    <br />
                    is the language? (efficient, &quot;how&quot;) what is its physical nature? How
                    <br />
                    does it work? (final, &quot;why&quot;) Why is it used? What is it good for?
                    <br />
                <p>It's easier for a computer database information:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* material: bits and bytes
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* formal: relational database
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* final: human users' proximate goals
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* efficient: computation
                    <br />
                <p>Or for scientific information:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* material: algebra, geometry
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* formal: empirical data
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* final: truth
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* efficient: maximization, computation
                    <br />
                <p>For business thinking:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* material: situations, actions, decisions (usually not explicit)
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* formal: market, resources
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* final: profit, values
                    <br />

                <p>One might wonder whether the more specific notion of a FORMal cause
                    <br />
                    would better capture the notion of &quot;inFORMation&quot;. Formal causes are the
                    <br />
                    constraints, the boundary conditions, but also the correlations. That,
                    <br />
                    of course, is a possibility, but wait: if we are describing the real
                    <br />
                    world, and we employ the formal cause as a descriptive metaphor, the
                    <br />
                    formal cause is a model. The scientific &quot;data&quot; is not objective, it's
                    <br />
                    itsef a model (made of numbers or ponts, formed in tables or graphs,
                    <br />
                    collected through measurements, and chosen to satisfy a scientist's
                    <br />
                    ambitions).
                    <br />
                <p>Of course, there may be better foundational metaphors for all this than
                    <br />
                    my interpretation of Aristotelian causality. But to avoid too much
                    <br />
                    confusion, &quot;information=model=representation=signs&quot; might be a good
                    <br />
                    definition that liberates information from its building blocks,
                    <br />
                    meanings, purposes and mechanisms. It's about meta-thinking, where a
                    <br />
                    thought, a model is in the focus. We can apply meta-thinking to the
                    <br />
                    thought of a thinker. We can apply meta-thinking to the thought of a
                    <br />
                    purpose. We can apply meta-thinking to the thought of a cause.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>3. Aristotelian models vs semiotic signs
                    <br />
                <p>I will try to map the four-fold causality to the notion of the sign. A
                    <br />
                    sign is a trajectory from input (object) through mediation
                    <br />
                    (representamen, vehicle) into an output (interpretant). The model in
                    <br />
                    Aristotelian scheme corresponds to the Peircean output. The input is the
                    <br />
                    formal cause of a model. But I decompose the mediation into generativity
                    <br />
                    (material), mechanism (efficient) and purpose (formal).
                    <br />
                <p>For an internalist the world should be pure firstness. But for a
                    <br />
                    practical discussion, we use various metaphors to convert it into
                    <br />
                    secondness and thirdness. In the example of scientific thinking, we
                    <br />
                    pretend that the &quot;data&quot; is a correct representation of firstness. An
                    <br />
                    internalist scientist will be aware that this is already a simplification.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>I would be grateful for comments, criticism and corrections.
                    <br />
