Some views on power law (you can find more detailed description of these 
<br />
views in the paper presented at this e-conference with corresponding 
<br />
references)
<br />
<p>It seems that via power law we can distinguish an internal reflective 
<br />
process from the external non-generic phenomenon. There should be something 
<br />
in the generated structure, which really is a limit of iteration that 
<br />
exhibits an internal process. Any internal (subjective) choice exhibits a 
<br />
structure of the semantic paradox, arising to Epimenides. The paradox 
<br />
results from mixing the notion of indicating an element with the act of 
<br />
indicating a set consisting of elements. We will formalize this approach via 
<br />
introducing the operation of determination of A and A-, denoted by F which 
<br />
can be expressed as an infinite recursion, x = F(F(F( …F(x)… ))), by mapping 
<br />
x = F(x) onto x = F(x). It can be considered as a point in a two dimensional 
<br />
space. The operation of F is the contraction in a two-dimensional domain, 
<br />
indicating either A or A-.
<br />
<p>Following the approach of Y.-P. Gunji (see his papers in BioSystems and 
<br />
other journals) we come to the following: because F(x) * x implies a 
<br />
self-similar set, x is expressed as a particular infinitely iterated s-tuple 
<br />
branching tree. In this x, the length of the kth branch, which is denoted by 
<br />
x, is n/sk, where n is the length of the first branch, and the number or the 
<br />
frequency of branch x, which is denoted by f(x), is sk. Therefore we get 
<br />
x*f(x) = (n/sk)*sk = n (constant). Roughly speaking, this idea can be 
<br />
generalized to get one of solutions for F(x). If faithfulness of A is 
<br />
denoted by m, the invariance of faithfulness with respect to contraction is 
<br />
expressed as f(m)*m = constant, where m is the value of faithfulness and 
<br />
f(m) is the probability of m. If distribution of f(m) does not have an 
<br />
off-set peak, m directly means the rank. Then f(m)*m=c represents what is 
<br />
called the Zipf’s law, i.e. log (f(m)) = -m+c.
<br />
<p>The similar formula was introduced by Mandelbrot (1982) for the fractal 
<br />
structure, actually fractal is an iteration arising from the set of complex 
<br />
numbers by squaring them, i.e. by reflecting them to the two-dimensional 
<br />
space. An observer cannot detect the Zipf’s law until some tool appears, 
<br />
which is a hyperlink between the other objects. It allows realization of the 
<br />
combinatorial game between the objects connected by the hyperlink. The third 
<br />
dimension is a reflection over this 2D domain. It appears if we estimate the 
<br />
actualization domain (brane) for the error-correction. This is possible only 
<br />
through the introduction of the internal time of observer. As a result, the 
<br />
3D+T structure appears.
<br />
<p>According to the Zipf's law, the probability of occurrence of words or other 
<br />
items starts high and tapers off exponentially. Thus a few occur very often 
<br />
while many others occur rarely. The distribution of words is often an 
<br />
inverse exponential like e-an.  The power laws can be indicative of the 
<br />
self-organized criticality. The linear iteration with the power law leads to 
<br />
the golden ratio limit. The golden ratio appears as a threshold for 
<br />
establishing a connection between local and global periods of the word. The 
<br />
local period at any position in the word is defined as the shortest 
<br />
repetition (a square) ‘centered’ in that position. The shortest repetition 
<br />
from that position is described by the golden ratio.
<br />
<p>The power law and the fractal structure appear in the systems exhibiting 
<br />
reflective control.
