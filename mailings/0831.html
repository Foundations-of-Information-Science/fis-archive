<p>
Human language is the &quot;main difference between ourselves and our 
<br />
nearest (mammal) relatives&#x160; it is a collection of noises produced by 
<br />
the voice arbitrarily linked to ideas&#x160; (it is ) composed of 
<br />
arbitrarily (chosen) sounds&#x160; (it is) the result of conscious 
<br />
invention.&quot; [Englefeld 1977].
<br />
<p>The language has been always the main means employed by humans for 
<br />
transferring their ideas to other brains. Such a transference 
<br />
comprises also the communication of wishes, intentions, warnings and 
<br />
very often orders and instructions that should be compulsively 
<br />
accomplished.
<br />
<p>Consequently it seems clear  that language has been always necessary 
<br />
for the integration of the information that would be required for 
<br />
maintaining dynamically functional every civilizing intention, which 
<br />
means that most information integrated has been inevitably 
<br />
conditioned by cultural appraisals and assumptions but also by 
<br />
authoritarian interests.
<br />
<p>However what apparently characterizes better the information that 
<br />
have been employed by all humans until today is the data required by 
<br />
the decision making organized by the elites interested in maintaining 
<br />
the civilizing trends - even when they had become unsustainable - But 
<br />
the prevailing decision making all along the last six to eight 
<br />
millennia has been determined by a generalized utilitarianism as it 
<br />
was identified rather recently by Francis Bacon; for him the aim of 
<br />
knowledge was its (potential) usefulness.
<br />
<p>Therefore through communication and even simple conversation the 
<br />
minds of decision makers use all possible means to complement their 
<br />
assumptions and appraisals about the possible usefulness of facts and 
<br />
events that in their view might help to maintain their intentions 
<br />
very often without recognizing that they will reduce soon the 
<br />
survival chances of masses of people and also of other species and 
<br />
without realizing that it is troubling and disrupting already some of 
<br />
the terrestrial circumstances that made possible the emergence of 
<br />
life. The future of human life has become more and more risky due to 
<br />
the happenings purposefully organized along the last centuries. Such 
<br />
a danger has increased explosively during the last century.
<br />
<p>But until today most decision makers reject to recognize such risks 
<br />
and dangers because they assume that it will be possible ALWAYS to 
<br />
finance any research for organizing more and more efficiently and 
<br />
effectively the exploitation of natural resources and human resources.
<br />
<p>Nowadays there are plenty of researchers, experts and scholars who 
<br />
prefer to continue discovering and inventing causal interactions of 
<br />
all kinds of phenomena that in their view might help to make 
<br />
sustainable any of the pretended features of the so called 
<br />
civilization which has become frankly unsustainable.
<br />
<p>I dare to assume that the ways employed until today for increasing 
<br />
the INFORMATION about the terrestrial circumstances (the natural and 
<br />
social ones) have been determined by narrow minded and shortsighted 
<br />
interests.
