<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I need now to think about (and attend to these discussions on) how a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalism, say category theory, can deal with the embodiment of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological matter in the world….
</em><br />
<p>Category theory, information theory and statistics are all based on a 
<br />
characterization of the world in terms of two concepts:
<br />
<p>* Objects (A, B, C,...)
<br />
* Morphisms (for any pair of objects X, Y, there may be zero or more 
<br />
morphisms between X and Y - let me call them &quot;connections&quot;)
<br />
<p>Can we slice and dice the world up into objects and connections between 
<br />
them?
<br />
<p>State space is the notion of slicing and dicing any &quot;situation&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;state&quot; into a particular object. Dynamics is a morphism of changes and 
<br />
transitions between states.
<br />
<p>==
<br />
<p>Kevin's notion of translation is a very powerful one. Indeed, we are 
<br />
translating (or approximating) something mysterious and vague into the 
<br />
terms of something known and precise. We're filtering perception into 
<br />
objects and morphisms. We're filtering all that we can intuitively 
<br />
understand into the mechanistic template of objects and morphisms. The 
<br />
whole enterprise of science seems to be to map everything one can wonder 
<br />
about into objects and morphisms.
<br />
<p>Now consider the bubbling foam in a quiet bend of a river. Where are the 
<br />
objects and morphisms? Consider the orbit of a planet. Where are the 
<br />
objects and morphisms? Consider a colony of bacteria. Where are the 
<br />
objects and morphisms? Consider a poem. Where are the objects and morphisms?
<br />
<p>==
<br />
<p>I think we should relax these bonds. Sure, everything can be chopped up. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you manage to chop things up into discrete events, you can apply 
<br />
Shannon's information theory. If you chop things up into differentiable 
<br />
functions, you can apply calculus. But this is all known. What FIS can 
<br />
do is question the underlying representations, to propose a new way of 
<br />
describing that helps communicate the mystique of, say, a turbulent flow.
<br />
<p>There is an interesting toy, ParticleSuck 
<br />
<a href="../../www.experimentalgameplay.com/dl.php@gn=00_Gravity_2FParticleSuck.zip">http://www.experimentalgameplay.com/dl.php?gn=00_Gravity/ParticleSuck.zip</a> 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(the description is at 
<br />
<a href="../../www.experimentalgameplay.com/Prototypes/00_Gravity/ParticleSuck_postmortem.rtf">http://www.experimentalgameplay.com/Prototypes/00_Gravity/ParticleSuck_postmortem.rtf</a>) 
<br />
Play with it. Think how you could communicate what's happening without 
<br />
having to work with 1000 particles? We seem to be able to understand the 
<br />
flow, comprehend it, but not communicate it.
<br />
<p>Is there a similar example in bionetworks?
<br />
<p>Once it can be communicated in some way, it is easy to work it out and 
<br />
build the symbol-wrangling toolbox of mathematics around it. But I might 
<br />
be overly idealistic about our ability to break free of object/relation 
<br />
shackles.
<br />
<p>==
<br />
<p>Maybe it's also better to speak of models (theories) and data than of 
<br />
information. Information is the amount of &quot;surprise&quot; that some data 
<br />
yields with respect to a model. The reason for the chaos boom in physics 
<br />
is that some patterns of pendular/orbital dynamics were still surprising 
<br />
with respect to Newton's model. The model is good when no data surprises 
<br />
us.
<br />
<p>In that sense, the information is easy once we figure out what the model 
<br />
is and what the data is.
<br />
<p>I can see that information is understood in a somewhat different way 
<br />
sometimes. For example, Jerry wrote &quot;How does an enzyme know how to 
<br />
inform a chemical change?&quot; To avoid antropomorphisms: how can we predict 
<br />
the catalytic action or inaction of an enzyme?
<br />
<p>&quot;From the perspective of information, how is it possible that 
<br />
bionetworks construct the informed flows of electrical current flow and 
<br />
how is it related metabolic flows&quot; -- In other words, can we apply the 
<br />
metaphor of a flow to bionetworks?
<br />
<p>&quot;what is the nature of the code that an enzyme contains such that it 
<br />
conducts an informed catalytic process?&quot; -- Can we employ the metaphor 
<br />
of natural language to the enzyme's code?
<br />
<p>I find this list of open challenges very interesting, but I don't have 
<br />
the &quot;data&quot; to be able to perform the translation. I haven't been looking 
<br />
at the cells, measuring and experimenting long enough to even consider 
<br />
the possibility of being able to do the translation. And I won't even 
<br />
start with the shackles of translating the infinite complexity of the 
<br />
cell into a data set.
