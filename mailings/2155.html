Dear Pedro,
<br />
<p>Your posting here clearly articulates my own thinking on the matter - I 
<br />
am in complete agreement. 
<br />
<p>As I pointed out in my earlier post, I believe the point of distinction 
<br />
lies at the birth of complexity.  I will go further to argue my 
<br />
hypothesis that all complexity is the manifestation of the engineering 
<br />
of sentience.
<br />
<p>There is indeed a point at which mechanical interpretation is no longer 
<br />
sufficient, and it is at that point that our current models of 
<br />
information break down.  Our existing mathematical tools prevent us from 
<br />
adequately providing a description of this information model - we simply 
<br />
do not today have a formal convention by which we can build consensus. 
<br />
<p>My own theories rely on the introduction of a new universal primitive 
<br />
(analogous to gravity - inert and present) to account for this shift and 
<br />
requires that information in complexity account for the presence of 
<br />
experience and the resulting evolution of senses by natural selection.
<br />
<p>In my own work I have introduced a primitive operation &quot;experience-of,&quot; 
<br />
the quantified result of which is the benefit it provides to the 
<br />
survival of organism - i.e., it can be applied quantitatively to the 
<br />
tensor or vector in which it is found.  This is very early work and it 
<br />
is very far from clear to me today that this approach will be sufficient. 
<br />
<p>However, in applying the approach to a fully integrated set of equations 
<br />
and information theory I am developing of a notion of &quot;covariance&quot; that 
<br />
will capture complexity (motile sensory organism) while describing the 
<br />
non-complex phenomena involved. 
<br />
<p>It may be that in such equations the distinction that you point to can 
<br />
be adequately and formally expressed.  It certainly requires additional 
<br />
concepts - as I said earlier this month - that deals with the complex 
<br />
process of &quot;recognition.&quot;
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven
<br />

&gt; Dear colleagues,
&gt;
&gt; At the time being, none of the approaches and definitions of 
&gt; information presented has managed to cross the informational divide 
&gt; between the animate and the inanimate --though  it has been ignored or 
&gt; sidestepped in different ways. How to do that is in my opinion one of 
&gt; the most pressing questions we have to confront.
&gt;
&gt; Proclaiming a &quot;queen&quot; discipline (physics and molecular science for 
&gt; some parties, or mathematical logics or computer science for others, 
&gt; or semiotics, or biology itself in my own case) and getting ahead 
&gt; overextending its provincial taxonomy of information will not solve at 
&gt; all the global problem.
&gt;
&gt; A prolegomena articulating a &quot;new way of thinking&quot; seems necessary 
&gt; --maybe incorporating items such as the essential openness of human 
&gt; beings, their social creation and maintenance of different knowledge 
&gt; modalities, the way each individual's nervous systems links percepts 
&gt; and actions and store them into mixed &quot;cognits&quot; that through 
&gt; languaging are transformed into &quot;concepts&quot; (so attempting an integral 
&gt; sensorymotor approach to meaning)...  all the way down to the 
&gt; evolutionary origins of nervous systems and the organizational 
&gt; properties of living cells --their biomolecular networks-- as 
&gt; responsible for the appearance of the aninamate/inanimate divide. And, 
&gt; yes, most of the views discussed on &quot;information physics&quot; can be added 
&gt; herewith, and the communication theory conceptualizations.
&gt;
&gt; I think it was Faraday who produced a memorable lecture on the 
&gt; complexity of a candle-flame. If we can find hundred of chemical 
&gt; reactions, combustions, convections, flows, etc. involved in a 
&gt; daunting combination of amazing resilience and quasi-adaptive 
&gt; properties---what is the comparative secret in the organization of 
&gt; biomolecular networks to evolutionary beget millions and millions of 
&gt; different &quot;flames&quot; of increasing complexity, neural systems included?
&gt;
&gt; It is the &quot;flame of life&quot; what demands the most radical 
&gt; informational-interpretation, of course, the molecular elaboration of 
&gt; meaning included (cellularly &amp; neuronally).
&gt;
&gt; best
&gt;
&gt; Pedro
