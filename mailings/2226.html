Subject: RE: [Fis] The Molecule as Text
<br />
<p><p>Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>The weekend has allowed me to catch up on this already multi-branching 
<br />
discussion. Let me take one item that has appeared in two postings: &quot;logic&quot;.
<br />
<p>Pedro calls our attention to the special embodiment of biomolecular agency, 
<br />
say across different domains of an enzyme, or across the genome, 
<br />
analogizing it to the parallel decomposition of logical clauses that can be 
<br />
&quot;explored and solved in independent steps.&quot;   On a different topic, Ted 
<br />
remarks that the logics involved in natural computation are confined to 
<br />
first-order and probabilistic logics, commenting that this is an 
<br />
unnecessary limitation.
<br />
<p>Well, I would say that logic is both less and more than this. The analogy 
<br />
of a protein or sequence of DNA to a logical expression in some kind of 
<br />
clausal form (say a conjunction of disjunctions) is a very lossy analogy. 
<br />
It is all about using decomposition to help determine a truth value.  But 
<br />
perhaps we could rescue the analogy to logic (even to first-order logic) by 
<br />
pointing out that things are more relevant when we do not have fully 
<br />
clausal form. That is, consider the case of complex logical expressions in 
<br />
which the scope of quantifiers extends across not-too-short ranges, and in 
<br />
which identical variables reappear at different loci, introducing couplings 
<br />
across the expression (like pronouns strewn across a paragraph in English). 
<br />
I am not a biochemist, but the tension between decomposability and coupling 
<br />
is what these two situations (molecular and logical) have in 
<br />
common.  Actually, to take it further, to escape the centrality of &quot;truth 
<br />
value&quot; in logical expressions perhaps one should make the analogy to large 
<br />
Lisp-like programs, the foundation for early 1990s work in Genetic Programming.
<br />
<p>Must natural computation rely on first-order and/or probabilistic logic? 
<br />
That would indeed, as Ted says, be a limitation. But I see the term 
<br />
&quot;computer science&quot; at least as open as &quot;logic.&quot; Well, maybe even more 
<br />
open.  The key insight in 20th century logic was the clean separation of 
<br />
syntax and semantics, of proof theory and model theory. This is so 
<br />
ingrained, and so attractive. However, I can detect in these FIS sessions a 
<br />
sense that this clean separation is out of place when we consider life, 
<br />
and, a fortiori, I would say, natural computation. Indeed. (I hope to post 
<br />
something further on this soon.) I think the information-perspective 
<br />
examination of molecular bionetworks takes computer science to exactly the 
<br />
same place as linguistics when it began (in some circles) to move beyond 
<br />
fully formalist syntactic theorizing (e.g. that there were purely syntactic 
<br />
language universals) to cognitive and construction grammar. In the latter, 
<br />
syntax is not separable, and the primitives of grammar are not atomic. 
<br />
Categories like nouns and verbs have little integrity; the notion of a 
<br />
&quot;construction&quot; is primitive. (See e.g. W. Croft, Radical Construction 
<br />
Grammar, Oxford 2001). This has allowed (some) linguists to find more 
<br />
useful ways to talk about the &quot;embodiment&quot; of language.  An utterance, like 
<br />
a protein, is a structured object that goes out into the real world and 
<br />
plays a role, and has a very delicate, but very principled, 
<br />
structure-function relation.
<br />
<p>This is a sideways approach to Ted's molecules-as-text idea, I suppose. 
<br />
Texts are structured,  amenable to interpretation --but not freely so-- and 
<br />
are sensitive to milieu.
<br />
<p>So, I need now to think about (and attend to these discussions on) how a 
<br />
formalism, say category theory, can deal with the embodiment of biological 
<br />
matter in the world&#x2026;.
<br />
<p>Many thanks for these stimuli&#x2026;
<br />
<p>-- Kevin
