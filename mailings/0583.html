<p>
Dear Karl, Rafael, Werner, Pedro and All
<br />
<p>This message seeks to address several related points and hence is a 
<br />
bit long. The topic of this thread is exactly the related points to 
<br />
which I am referring.  I close this long message with a plea for HELP!
<br />
<p>First, thank you Rafael for your excellent summary of the 
<br />
philosophical history of the concept of &quot;thingedness.&quot;  It covers the 
<br />
history up to the middle of the last century nicely.  However, in the 
<br />
last fifty years, our basic understanding of life and being has been 
<br />
altered by the progress in molecular recognition,  molecular biology, 
<br />
molecular nutrition, molecular neurology, etc.  The basic premise of 
<br />
chemistry, that all (stable) matter of ordinary experience is 
<br />
composed from atoms of the atomic table has been shown to apply to 
<br />
life itself.   This is a radical change in our knowledge of 
<br />
ourselves.  Thus, the need for a new metaphysics.
<br />
<p>So, what is the metaphysics of information?  My dictionary defines metaphysics
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;1. A branch of philosophy that deals with first principles of things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;including such concepts as being, substance, essence, time, space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;cause, and identity; theoretical philosophy as the ultimate science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of being and knowing.
</em><br />
<p>This definition shows correspondence relations between basic concerns 
<br />
of science, space, time, substance, identity and cause and the basic 
<br />
concerns of metaphysics.
<br />
<p>What can metaphysicians contribute to this discussion of information?
<br />
<p>I argue that information is a concept related to communication. 
<br />
Thus, when Werner argues that:
<br />
<p>(I cannot understand why several FISers like to consider information as
<br />
a property of a system itself, like mass, energy, momentum in physics.
<br />
To me and I believe to any engineer,
<br />
information is binary as interaction in physics it is a relation between
<br />
two things),
<br />
(See below, Werner and Shannon appear to be in full agreement on this point.)
<br />
<p>I strongly support Werner's view (except for the possible ambiguity 
<br />
of the reference for usage of &quot;binary&quot;.  Chemical communication is 
<br />
between two things but a chemical communication is not via a &quot;binary&quot; 
<br />
object.)
<br />
<p>As pointed out in my extended abstract, the notion of communication 
<br />
is derived from the root of &quot;common&quot; and hence tightly associated 
<br />
with the concept of community.  From this perspective, which draws 
<br />
upon radically different metaphysical foundations, information is 
<br />
seen as a relation between two things (objects, entities, beings). 
<br />
This relation can be a simple binary relation (such as a bit, or it 
<br />
could be more complex, a signal, a molecule, a set of molecules, a 
<br />
page of a written transcript, a musical score, etc.
<br />
<p>This metaphysical perspective of information recognizes that 
<br />
information flows can be &quot;one to many&quot; or &quot;many to one&quot;, as well as 
<br />
binary.  (See the book by Biosot referenced in my extended abstract.) 
<br />
Shannon information, as defined, must conform to a bijection, in 
<br />
Shannon's terminology, &quot;to reproduce the message&quot; exactly.
<br />
<p>My view of &quot;information as a relation between two&quot; (or more) things 
<br />
was motivated from Shannon's model by relaxing the presupposition 
<br />
that communication is merely for engineering purposes.  From a 
<br />
metaphysical perspective, I presuppose that a community of 
<br />
individuals communicate about matters of common concern to the 
<br />
community.  (This FIS list is an example of the preceding sentence)
<br />
<p>(The exact quote from Shannon (page 31):
<br />
&quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing a 
<br />
message at one point either exactly or approximately a message 
<br />
selected at another point.  Frequently, messages have meaning, that 
<br />
is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with 
<br />
certain physical or conceptual entities.  These semantic aspects of 
<br />
communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.&quot;)
<br />
<p>A second metaphysical problem concerns the metaphysics of time as it 
<br />
relates to information, particularly the mathematics of information 
<br />
of Shannon.
<br />
&nbsp;From logic, we know that mathematical symbols are arbitrary.  Thus 
<br />
the meaning of a symbol depends on the assignment to a particular 
<br />
concept, thing, entity, idea, relation, etc.
<br />
<p>Shannon's mathematical symbols are assigned to mean a relation to 
<br />
time intervals for transmission of a symbol.
<br />
Mathematical symbols for entropy are assigned to mean a relation with 
<br />
Heat and with other thermodynamic parameters which form the bilinear 
<br />
group of thermodynamic equations.
<br />
<p>The metaphysical problem, from this perspective, if one desires 
<br />
relate the symbols of information with the symbols of heat, is to 
<br />
find a conversion factor or a narrative or a myth which creates a 
<br />
bijection between heat and time.
<br />
<p>Rafael - your comment on these views from your perspective of 
<br />
metaphysics would be warmly welcomed.
<br />
<p>Karl:  I found much to agree with in your response.  We concur on the 
<br />
need for a public language.  (This concept is closely related to the 
<br />
concept of communication in a community; a public language is 
<br />
essential to form a community of individuals.)
<br />
<p>We also agree that on the central role of thingedness in the material 
<br />
world.  Your views are close to the typical view of a chemist / 
<br />
biochemist.  (I have referred to similar, but conceptually abstract, 
<br />
views as &quot;radical materialism&quot;.)
<br />
But, as noted above, progress in chemistry has given us material 
<br />
descriptions of   most &quot;things&quot; in terms of chemical structures and 
<br />
associated chemical agglomerations and often these descriptions are 
<br />
strongly supported by quantum mechanical calculations grounded in 
<br />
physics.  Many advances of technology are directly relatable to our 
<br />
new understandings of the dynamical structures of simple components 
<br />
of complex objects.
<br />
<p>But, do physicists agree that this is a source of solutions to &quot;deep problems&quot;?
<br />
And, it appears to me that the recent advances in the chemistry of 
<br />
life have created vast new problems for the philosophers.  (The 
<br />
relevance of this comment is questionable... given the nature of 
<br />
philosophical problems.)
<br />
<p>Could you say more about what you mean by &quot;pre-logical&quot;?  I do not 
<br />
understand this usage at all.
<br />
<p>With regard to number theory, I remain pretty much in the dark as to 
<br />
your meaning.  I certainly concur that numbers play a critical role 
<br />
in science and technology and human communication in general.  The 
<br />
fact that numbers can be used indexically is crucial.  And, numbers 
<br />
are critical for creating correspondence relations between the 
<br />
external world (thingedness) and our internal mental images. 
<br />
Furthermore, numbers play a central role as a central &quot;generator&quot; of 
<br />
mathematical objects of many types (ie, the concept of species in 
<br />
category theory).
<br />
<p>I wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your &quot;very technical approach&quot; could be translated as a special type 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of super-reductionism by incorporating temporal relations and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditional propositions into materialism. Can you relate this &quot;very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technical approach&quot; to complex systems and such problems as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Once we have agreement on the existence of a mathematical entity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that behaves like a thing (or &quot;carrier of potential information&quot; in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rafael's parlance) then we shall be able to use this building block 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to build structures with no end in sight. Like once we define this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a Lego building block, we can build very complex and useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models. Indeed, my theory is a fine example of a super-reductionism. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It investigates the translation between logical structures and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carrier objects on which one can observe the logical structures. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory does allow rather complex evolutionary processes.
</em><br />
<p>Intuitively, I find your response very appealing, but I do not 
<br />
understand how this is to be done.  A central problem is the 
<br />
irregularity of the mathematics of chemical systems.  This implies 
<br />
also the mathematics of living systems.  The irregularity of chemical 
<br />
structures and chemical dynamics (living structures and living 
<br />
dynamics)  denies me access to
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;the translation between logical structures and carrier objects on 
<br />
which one can observe the logical structures&quot;
<br />
<p>I am denied access to this route by the fact that chemical structures 
<br />
are mathematically expressed in terms of labeled graphs and that 
<br />
these labeled graphs can not be placed in correspondence with the 
<br />
natural numbers.  In short, each chemical identity (entity, compound, 
<br />
object, thing) is a unique category.
<br />
<p>I wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the concept of time is intertwined with the concept of number. How 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do you justify this interrelation? At issue is the nature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find one of the strong suits of my theory that it uses any kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence and relates its information-carrying capacity to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information-carrying capacity of any kind of contempororary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assembly. One is free to give a sequence (a mathematical entity) an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation as time slices. If you can number it consecutively, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then it is a sequence. I look into the interdependence between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cross-sectional and longitudinal collections of objects (carriers of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbols /information/). In everyday speak this means: I look into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the relations between collections that are here all at the same time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and collections that come one after the other. In a heroic allegory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about a theoretical living organism: the theoretical cell's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constituents are all present at the same time and all (each) of them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is relevant at the same moment, while the theoretical DNA gets read 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;off from start till the end, one (triplet) at a time, one after the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other. In the sequence, it is the neighbourhood relations that count 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(this comes after that), while in the contemporary assembly the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inclusion relations matter (this is like these and like those). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Continuity and discontinuity are discussed at great length and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detail also.
</em><br />
<p>Ok.  I now understand part of the mathematical approach.  The 
<br />
metaphysical issues concerning time are critical. Would it be fair to 
<br />
state that the metaphysical symbol exchange for &quot;time - heat&quot; is 
<br />
simpler than your proposed symbol exchange for &quot;time - matter&quot;?
<br />
<p>You wrote:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I propose to transcend the gap between  well established principles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of number theory and the concepts of communication between two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collections of message carriers by following steps:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) extend number theory to include multidimensional partitions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hitherto left undefined;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) introduce the concept of the structure of a set by discussing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;properties of multidimensional partitions;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) introduce the technique of linearisations of structured sets;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;4) discuss congruence relations between neighbourhood relations on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence and structures in a set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd prefer not to call neither a structured set (a contemporary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assembly) nor a sequence a system, but the interplay between these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two constitutes a system.
</em><br />
<p><p>Your agenda is clear. Have you published works concerning these 
<br />
topics?  I would be very interested in the details or in receiving 
<br />
electronic copies.
<br />
<p>Congratulations to all who have read this far!
<br />
<p>Can others contribute to the task of creating a new metaphysics that 
<br />
can be inclusive of information?
