<p>
It was indeed pessimistic the message that Stafford Beer expressed in 
<br />
1993, however the information = knowledge about the global 
<br />
circumstances that he had in his brain had not hindered him to 
<br />
continue inventing causal relations about the kind of human actions 
<br />
that might be structured in order to overcome social, economic and 
<br />
cultural  difficulties. Immediately afterwards the participants to 
<br />
the WOSC meeting knew another courageous and positive contribution of 
<br />
him. It intended to build new circumstances for increasing and 
<br />
reinforcing local autonomies, which are crucial for the 
<br />
implementation of actions that aim at increasing the feasibility of 
<br />
local actions that would contribute to create the conditions needed 
<br />
for a global sustainable development. Such actions require human 
<br />
beings willing anywhere to learn how to manage intelligently enough 
<br />
their everyday affairs)
<br />
<p>In my view, which certainly could be wrong, today at the dawn of one 
<br />
conventional 3rd millennium humankind is confronted to the worst 
<br />
crisis it has ever faced during the civilizing adventure. This crisis 
<br />
is mainly due to the many simplified ways INFORMATION or KNOWLEDGE of 
<br />
the terrestrial reality has been structured and has been implemented 
<br />
for making decisions. These decision have invariably aimed at 
<br />
maintaining the civilizing trends that have been always determined de 
<br />
facto by the members of the high society: the highly civilized 
<br />
individuals who are always searching either how to enjoy better and 
<br />
better facilities built and maintained by the human resources or how 
<br />
to organize another warfare in order to increase their power and to 
<br />
expand their dominions.
<br />
<p>Therefore I dare now tentatively to suggest that it would be 
<br />
convenient to examine deeply and extensively (in the domain of fis) 
<br />
the need of recognizing:
<br />
<p>1.	that every human may establish contact with the material 
<br />
reality located in his or her immediate surroundings exclusively 
<br />
through several kinds of sensations of the sensible qualities of 
<br />
those questions that each one had managed to identify holistically
<br />
<p>2.	that language, though words, offers every human the great 
<br />
possibility of knowing many facets of the experience accumulated in 
<br />
many other brains after being peculiarly perceived and bizarrely 
<br />
interpreted some facets of the surrounding reality that had become 
<br />
their concern.
<br />
<p>3	that words and other signs (all those that had been arranged 
<br />
as INFORMATION integrated as KNOWLEDGE for making decisions) are 
<br />
neither material things nor processes nor ideas.
<br />
<p>4.	that information transferred by means of oral words and/or 
<br />
written words and signs at best can be only partially certain for a 
<br />
short while.
<br />
<p>5.	that any possible knowledge attained about any real phenomena 
<br />
or subjective circumstances is only an interpretation of the some 
<br />
aspects of the reality that humans managed to perceive under the 
<br />
influence or even pressure of ideological bias (comprised the 
<br />
cultural one)
<br />
<p>6.	that during millennia most humans have been educated for 
<br />
being fascinated by one particular meaning assigned to every one of 
<br />
several words and symbols which have  become, in the domain of every 
<br />
community, cultural truths that should be respected forever.
<br />
<p>7.	that every human may and perhaps even should learn to use 
<br />
words and symbols as tools for searching how to improve continuously 
<br />
one or another perspective of one of the aspects of the reality 
<br />
perceived or some aspects of the reality interpreted by other humans
<br />
<p>8.	that the main information that humans need indispensably for 
<br />
organizing their individual and collective survival is composed by 
<br />
the arrangement of words that may allow them to comprehend the causal 
<br />
interactions of real and subjective phenomena happening in 
<br />
terrestrial environments and also to invent causal interactions of 
<br />
actions conceived for making a sensible transformation of more and 
<br />
more terrestrial circumstances located in the homosphere, in the 
<br />
biosphere and in the ecosphere.
