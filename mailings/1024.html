<p>
Jerry' letter raises really important points:
<br />
I am unaware of any specific process or logic that starts from
<br />
mechanical principles and generates chemical structures.
<br />
There is such an approach. It starts from mechanical principles and
<br />
generates chemical structures. Please see the usage of multidimensional
<br />
partitions, specifically the clusters of subsets with predictable properties
<br />
that are alqways present if the set size is above a minimum. These
<br />
constructs can well be used as representing the chemical elements. The
<br />
constructs obey the ordering principle n=2i**2, as observed in the periodic
<br />
table of elements.
<br />
<p>Alternatively, from a pure conceptual perspective, the question could be
<br />
asked:
<br />
If the concept of music is the same as the concept of a group, what
<br />
is the generative role of an individual's CNS in creating the
<br />
emotional response to a particular song / piece / performance?  Or,
<br />
what distinguishes two individual's response to the same music?
<br />
The biologic rhythm of each individual is based on a stochastic variation
<br />
(between maps from the sequenced into the commutative and from the
<br />
commutative into the sequenced way of describing the same state of the same
<br />
set). The picture in this question assumes biologic beings (humans ) as
<br />
being mechanical, with no individual variations. (The unspoken assumption
<br />
is: if the argument were right, then each and every person would be reacting
<br />
in an identical way to the same piece of music-) This is of course highly
<br />
debatable.
<br />
As another alternative way of stating this question:
<br />
While it is conceivable that a correspondence within one mind may
<br />
generate a perfect matching between a conceptualization of a group
<br />
and a conceptualization of a &quot;music&quot;, is it possible that two
<br />
genetically distant minds would generate  a different group for the
<br />
same &quot;music&quot;?
<br />
Yes, different people are different.
<br />
As possible sources of the distinctive interpretations
<br />
one could invoke differential hearing ranges, differential hearing
<br />
sensitivity, differential training in music, differential training in
<br />
mathematics, differential moods, and so forth.
<br />
And genetic variation, coming from the numerosity relations between the
<br />
cell's possible states and the DNA's possible states.
<br />
It goes without saying that mechanical thinking is extraordinarily
<br />
useful for solving mechanical problems. Our challenge, it seems to
<br />
me, is distinguishing mechanical from non mechanical problems.
<br />
In my contributions, I try to put forward the point that human (biologic)
<br />
realities obey the same principles as mechanics does. I try to find the
<br />
common between mechanical and non mechanical approaches to explanations
<br />
about the world.
<br />
&nbsp;In earlier posts I referred to this distinction as the difference
<br />
between Shannon information and human communication.
<br />
Yes, this is a good first approximation. Deeper understanding will show that
<br />
the Shannon algorithm invariably uses SEQUENCED media, where the information
<br />
lies in the SEQUENCE of the carriers' states. Now we observe that biologic
<br />
systems use CONTEMPORARY compositions. (Among others, the smell, the
<br />
physiology of a liquid nurturing the cell, etc. are not sequenced but a
<br />
COMMUTATIVE state. So, the distinction is not between machine and man, but
<br />
between receiving the beads of a necklace on the string (one after the
<br />
other) or in a sack, with no string (all at the same time). It is
<br />
irrelevant, whether the communication partners are men, machines or animals.
<br />
<p>Hope to have cleared up some misunderstandings between Michael and Jerry.
<br />
Karl
