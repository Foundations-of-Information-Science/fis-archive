Dear Koichiro and colleagues,
<br />
I agree that it was a difficult task for scientists like Shannon to 
<br />
discern the connection between entropy and information. You write, 
<br />
Koichiro, that “it may be extremely difficult to say something decent 
<br />
about the relationship between entropy and information as of now”. But, 
<br />
I believe that relationship is, since Jaynes work (E. T. Jaynes, Phys. 
<br />
Rev. 10 6, 6, 620-630, 1957), almost entirely explicated.
<br />
As I’ve continued to argue in this forum, all information is physical, 
<br />
Shannon’s equation for entropy (information) depicts the identical 
<br />
property of a physical system as does thermodynamic entropy, an entropy 
<br />
change is always equal and opposite to the information change (would 
<br />
Shu-Kun disagree with that?), and finally, as Jaynes explained, the 
<br />
Shannon formula prescribes the amount of information which will erase 
<br />
the uncertainty (entropy) in the probability distribution for any 
<br />
thermodynamic system.
<br />
Previously, I’ve maintained that the identity of the mathematical form 
<br />
of von Neumann’s quantum entropy and Shannon’s prescription (often 
<br />
called the von Neumann-Shannon formula) is no coincidence. Shannon tells 
<br />
us that information is just removal of the uncertainty of the outcome of 
<br />
a measurement (Bell Sys. Tech. J., 28, 3, p. 379, 1948). But, that’s 
<br />
exactly what von Neumann described some sixteen years before Shannon. 
<br />
The quantum wave function predicts the probable outcome of the next 
<br />
measurement of a system, and the von Neumann formula gives the 
<br />
uncertainty in that measurement outcome.
<br />
In my view, the principle unresolved questions about information and 
<br />
entropy pertain to time-dependent information where no heat flows 
<br />
through the system, to the fundamental problem for computer information 
<br />
storage regarding the entropy cost of writing and erasing a sequence of 
<br />
information bits, and to all those problems with non-equilibrium 
<br />
thermodynamic systems. Are there other, additional areas of remaining 
<br />
concern?
<br />
You write about Maxwell’s demon and the Szilard engine, Koichiro. 
<br />
Maxwell suggested his demon, not as an example of failure of the Second 
<br />
Law in special circumstances, but as a demonstration that the Second Law 
<br />
is statistical in origin. And, Szilard’s engine (Z. Phys. 53, 1929, p. 
<br />
840) is probably the best model for understanding why at least one 
<br />
information bit is required to reduce the entropy of a confined ideal gas.
<br />
Szilard suggested that his engine could not violate the Second Law 
<br />
because the information acquired by his “demon” observer would also 
<br />
increase that demon’s entropy. Zurek (in Frontiers of Nonequilibrium 
<br />
Statistical Physics, Plenum, New York, 1984, p. 151) analyzed the engine 
<br />
quantum mechanically, and claimed to have affirmed Szilard’s suggestion. 
<br />
Many other physicists have reached essentially the same conclusion.
<br />
But, in a recent publication (Found. Phys. Lett., 16, 1, 2003, p. 41 and 
<br />
reprised on the web in Entropy) I’ve demonstrated that the measurement 
<br />
necessary for engine operation actually LOWERS the entropy of the 
<br />
measurement apparatus (the “demon”), and I listed several fatal mistakes 
<br />
in Zurek’s analysis. More generally, Earmann and Norton (Stud. Hist. 
<br />
Phil. Mod. Phys., 30, 1, 1999, pp. 1-40) reviewed many of the attempted 
<br />
information-based exorcisms of Maxwell’s demon, including Zurek’s, and 
<br />
found they all lacked credibility. They conclude, as Maxwell did, that 
<br />
the “demon” verifies the statistical character of the Second Law; it 
<br />
doesn’t violate that law.
<br />
You suggest, Koichiro, that the demon could be “a very strange folk 
<br />
contacting two worlds, very hot and very cold, at the same time....” And 
<br />
that the Maxwell demon “can take advantage of quantum coherence as a 
<br />
means of living in the two worlds, hot and cold, simultaneously.” But, 
<br />
quantum coherence is just the state of any physical system (usually a 
<br />
compound system of elementary constituents, like the S-state of two 
<br />
polarized photons) which survives between measurements (information 
<br />
transfers) of the system. The wave function is reduced by measurement 
<br />
(Zurek’s decoherence), and that coherent state is annihilated, while 
<br />
another is created. So, I suppose your proposed “demon”, Koichiro, could 
<br />
contact both a hot and cold reservoir, just like any classical 
<br />
non-equilibrium thermodynamic device.
<br />
You write that “Forming a quantum coherence effectively at a low 
<br />
temperature and letting the once cohered decohere effectively at a high 
<br />
temperature is the way of living on the part of the shrewd Maxwell 
<br />
demon.” This just means that the “demon” would make one measurement at 
<br />
the low temperature and then another at high temperature.
<br />
But, a “demon” is conceived of as a device that might somehow lower the 
<br />
entropy of a thermodynamic system without increasing its own entropy or 
<br />
doing work. So, to approximate plausibility, such a device cannot, 
<br />
itself, be a heat engine operating between different temperatures. (It 
<br />
is no surprise, after all, that an engine can do work which compresses 
<br />
an ideal gas, say, lowering its entropy.) It must be in thermal 
<br />
equilibrium with the thermodynamic system, and is usually portrayed as a 
<br />
measuring device which detects particular properties of the constituents 
<br />
of that thermodynamic system.
<br />
I’m unaware of any physically conceivable device (no violations of 
<br />
existing physical laws) with a believable claim to challenge the Second 
<br />
Law. Sheehan’s extensive menagerie of devices, for example, were all 
<br />
spawned from a relatively obvious approximation error in his initial 
<br />
publication.
<br />
Thanks for your very interesting and galvanizing postings.
<br />
Cordially,
<br />
<p>Michael Devereux
