John,
<br />
<p>You commented:
<br />
<p>&lt;Either information theory involves meaning, and has
<br />
&lt;something useful to say about it, in which case it is a part of semiotics, to
<br />
&lt;which we should probably turn attention, or it does not, in which case it is
<br />
&lt;independent.
<br />
<p>Yes, I think this is a key question for us. I would prefer to see our
<br />
information theory remain as a promising orphan, in a nascent 'umbrella domain',
<br />
capable of shifting its shape across the sciences rather than as some extrinsic
<br />
notion within sub-specialities like semiotics, informatics, hermeneutics etc.
<br />
I'm with Locke - let's take &quot;a view of human knowledge in the whole extent of it.&quot;
<br />
<p>By semiotics I assume you are including all schools (including Saussurian)
<br />
and their progeny. Obviously not all linguists would subsume meaning under 'sign'.
<br />
<p>If a (possibly non-Shannonist) information theory were to adopt 'meaning'
<br />
does it head off for a semantic bushwalk (with Frege, Fodor, Dretske et al)? 
<br />
It might be more fruitful for our theory to explore a resonant concept like
<br />
'abduction'(which has attracted Gregory Bateson, C S Pierce and the radical 
<br />
constructivists who have occasionally hovered over our conversations).
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I think it sounds like we do kinda agree.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The main reason I introduced the point about enzymes being &quot;fooled&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pharmaceutical molecules (and, of course, by many natural ones, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well), though, was to emphasize a point that is stressed in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical literature on biological functions.  That is, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;normativity is of the essence.  That is, for something to count as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function in the proper (biological) sense of the word, there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something that it is supposed to do, something that it can get either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;right or wrong. In short, the concept of function entails that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;malfunction (as well as success, or correct function, of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wanted to make this point about function entailing malfunction because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe this is where the roots of &quot;purpose&quot; lie in biology (which you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were questioning). And insofar as information, properly speaking, must

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be recognized as having a semantic component, and insofar as meaning is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likewise a normative and teleological concept, then I believe that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;roots of information lie in this same knot of problems, as well.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sum, as I see it, all of our aporiae in theoretical biology revolve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;around the ontological status of purpose and value.
</em><br />
<p>I have been following this discussion with interest. I agree with
<br />
this pretty much completely. I now have an observation: the discipline that
<br />
deals with the interpretation of signs is called &quot;semiotics&quot; (John Locke,
<br />
Inquiry chapter XXI) . Either information theory involves meaning, and has
<br />
something useful to say about it, in which case it is a part of semiotics, to
<br />
which we should probably turn attention, or it does not, in which case it is
<br />
independent. Most approaches to information theory that have recognized
<br />
this dilemma have taken the latter route. We, if we wish to decide the
<br />
foundations of information science, must make a decision: is information
<br />
theory a branch of semiotics, in which case the foundations of information
<br />
science are semiotics, or are they independent but interlinked disciplines,
<br />
each with their own foundations?
<br />
<p>John
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From Locke:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter XXI
<br />
Of the Division of the Sciences
<br />
<p>1. Science may be divided into three sorts. All that can fall within the 
<br />
compass of human understanding, being either, First, the nature of things, 
<br />
as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: 
<br />
or, Secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and 
<br />
voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness: or, 
<br />
Thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the 
<br />
other of these is attained and communicated; I think science may be divided 
<br />
properly into these three sorts:-
<br />
<p>2. Physica. First, The knowledge of things, as they are in their own proper 
<br />
beings, their constitution, properties, and operations; whereby I mean not 
<br />
only matter and body, but spirits also, which have their proper natures, 
<br />
constitutions, and operations, as well as bodies. This, in a little more 
<br />
enlarged sense of the word, I call Phusike, or natural philosophy. The end 
<br />
of this is bare speculative truth: and whatsoever can afford the mind of 
<br />
man any such, falls under this branch, whether it be God himself, angels, 
<br />
spirits, bodies; or any of their affections, as number, and figure, &amp;c.
<br />
<p>3. Practica. Secondly, Praktike, The skill of right applying our own powers 
<br />
and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most 
<br />
considerable under this head is ethics, which is the seeking out those 
<br />
rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means 
<br />
to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge 
<br />
of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.
<br />
<p>4. Semeiotike. Thirdly, the third branch may be called Semeiotike, or the 
<br />
doctrine of signs; the most usual whereof being words, it is aptly enough 
<br />
termed also Logike, logic: the business whereof is to consider the nature 
<br />
of signs, the mind makes use of for the understanding of things, or 
<br />
conveying its knowledge to others. For, since the things the mind 
<br />
contemplates are none of them, besides itself, present to the 
<br />
understanding, it is necessary that something else, as a sign or 
<br />
representation of the thing it considers, should be present to it: and 
<br />
these are ideas. And because the scene of ideas that makes one man's 
<br />
thoughts cannot be laid open to the immediate view of another, nor laid up 
<br />
anywhere but in the memory, a no very sure repository: therefore to 
<br />
communicate our thoughts to one another, as well as record them for our own 
<br />
use, signs of our ideas are also necessary: those which men have found most 
<br />
convenient, and therefore generally make use of, are articulate sounds. The 
<br />
consideration, then, of ideas and words as the great instruments of 
<br />
knowledge, makes no despicable part of their contemplation who would take a 
<br />
view of human knowledge in the whole extent of it. And perhaps if they were 
<br />
distinctly weighed, and duly considered, they would afford us another sort 
<br />
of logic and critic, than what we have been hitherto acquainted with.
