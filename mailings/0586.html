<p>
I wanted to respond to Werner's very perceptive posting just briefly, to
<br />
say that I agree completely that information implies a relation, and
<br />
that this kind of relation comes into the world with the origin of life.
<br />
But I just wanted to add that we still need to specify a little more
<br />
what sort of relation it is.
<br />
<p>I have argued that the correct way to look at information is as an
<br />
element in a special sort of dynamical interaction. Within the framework
<br />
of F.E. Yates's homeodynamics, we can conceptualize the organism (or
<br />
just the cell) as a network of loosely coupled, highly nonlinear
<br />
oscillators. I have proposed that each of these oscillators be conceived
<br />
of as trigger-dependent, in such a way that a portion or subsystem of
<br />
the oscillator is sensitive to a low-energy signal from the outside
<br />
world such that the signal is correlated with the normal conditions
<br />
supporting the function, in the sense of preserving the dynamical
<br />
stability of the oscillator. In other words, all biofunctions are
<br />
postulated to use low-energy signals as probes of their environment to
<br />
determine when conditions are right for functional action. (Low-energy
<br />
is important, because you don't want the signal itself to destabilize
<br />
the larger system.) Due to past successful oscillations and the
<br />
established correlations, the presence of the signal is tantamount to
<br />
the prediction of the future success of a new functional action (where
<br />
&quot;success&quot; means the perservation of the dynamical stability of the
<br />
oscillator). Thus, according to this model, information is a predictor
<br />
of the success of functional action.
<br />
<p>This model provides a generalization of the notion of perception. Just
<br />
as I use photon collisions on my retinas to move my body through space
<br />
in such a way as to avoid high-energy collisions, so too every sort of
<br />
biological function is predicted to have an analogous subsystem
<br />
sensitive to low-energy signals in the same way. And, indeed, this seems
<br />
to be the way that proteins and most other molecular structures in the
<br />
cell function. In enzymes, for example, the sense organ is the active
<br />
site, which couples to the surround noncovalently. So, this model
<br />
provides a picture (albeit a grossly abstract and qualitative one) of
<br />
how information can come into the world in the form of a special sort of
<br />
dynamical interaction. (Explaining how such an interaction itself is
<br />
possible is, of course, another matter, and one I believe that will
<br />
require recourse to QFT.)
<br />
<p>Finally, Jerry, I liked very much your discussion of information and
<br />
thermodynamics, and I just wanted to add the following quote in support:
<br />
<p>&quot;the Second Law and Shannon's Law are two different statements; what
<br />
they have in common is a mathematical formalism. Such sharing of
<br />
formalism is not at all unusual in theoretical physics: thus water waves
<br />
and light waves obey the same differential equations---but nobody would
<br />
conclude from this that light and ripples on water are the same thing.&quot;
<br />

<br />
UP, 1998, p. 46.)
