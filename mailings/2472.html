Stan Salthe asks,
<br />
<p>(1) A question for Richard:  Would it not be the gene pool, rather  
<br />
than the
<br />
(which one?) genome that would be the site of genetic variability?  Thus
<br />
the population would be the generator, and owner, of genetic  
<br />
informational
<br />
entropy.  Each realized genome would be one informational selection
<br />
(localization) from that entropic field, which would be somewhat like a
<br />
'wave function' in that new alleles would be forming all the time.
<br />
<p><p>Stan,
<br />
<p>Yes, I think you could say that about the gene pool, which comprises  
<br />
the alleles of a population.  And of course frequencies of alleles in  
<br />
populations are known to play importance roles in evolution (e.g., D.  
<br />
L. Hartl).
<br />
<p>I also think you are more accurate than I in our respective  
<br />
definitions of genomes.  The most accepted definition, I think,  
<br />
agrees with yours; that a genome is the &quot;the total complement of  
<br />
genes contained … in one complete haploid set of chromosomes of a  
<br />
eukaryote&quot; (D. L. Hartl).  My looser definition allows genomes to  
<br />
represent the genetic description of a species, such has the human  
<br />
genome, which can be differentiated from a chimpanzee genome.  This  
<br />
would be an entirely digital genome, assuming I knew everything  
<br />
important of epigenes and other genetic tweekers, and also assuming  
<br />
that they are digital too.
<br />
<p>If I knew everything important about the genes of a human genome,  
<br />
which would be entirely digital information, or QI, would I have  
<br />
enough information to make a human being, providing all the necessary  
<br />
materials were available?  I would say 'possibly,' if I somehow knew  
<br />
everything important about epigenes and other genetic attributes.
<br />
<p>Of course I am making a case that the digitality of genes qualifies  
<br />
them as QI, and that phenotypes, organisms, and populations are the  
<br />
utility functions of genes, operating analogously and continuously in  
<br />
physical nature.  Obviously there would be no digital genomes at all  
<br />
for any species without their physical populations.  Within those  
<br />
spatial boundaries, which are defined by analogs instead of digits,  
<br />
all of the alleles must be borne.  But I don't picture those alleles  
<br />
coming from the population per se; I see them coming from the genome  
<br />
by way of its gene pool (as you have reasoned) — and this grand  
<br />
assemblage of genes and epigenes define the species.  I think the  
<br />
alleles themselves are the actual sites of allele generation.  Genes  
<br />
do appear to act deterministically in the sense that they demonstrate  
<br />
certain ‘strateges’ for survival [sex to avoid genetic parasites  
<br />
(Hamilton's red queen), Prisoners-Dilemma compromises, etc.].  Is  
<br />
this simply a means of preserving biological QI?
<br />
<p>Everything is metaphor, I suppose, demanding ‘the price of eternal  
<br />
vigilance,’ as Rosenblueth &amp; Weiner have put it.  I admit to be  
<br />
leaning toward Dawkins’ metaphors: his ‘selfish genes’ and ‘extended  
<br />
phenotypes’ have their way with me (so far).  And I also think  
<br />
Gould’s &quot;deep homology&quot; trumps West-Eberhard's &quot;homoplasy&quot; as the  
<br />
better explanation of information transfer.  But when I see Harvard’s  
<br />
elite — Mayr, Lewontin, Eldredge — refer to genes as &quot;blueprints&quot; of  
<br />
proteins, I think they are quite confused about their metaphor, and  
<br />
about other things too.
<br />
<p>Maybe the genes are purely digital QI in biosystems, and the  
<br />
analogous populations are the wave functions. After all, they carry  
<br />
the biological QI forward as evolution occurs, acting as foster  
<br />
parents for those precocious alleles, whose evolutionary benefits are  
<br />
derived from entropy.  Have I gone too far?
<br />
<p>—Richard
