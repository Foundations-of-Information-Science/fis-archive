<p>
Dear Pedro, and All,
<br />
<p>Pedro stated that Wilsonian consilience involves reductionism as one of its 
<br />
central motifs.  I worry that the term 'reductionism' may be understood 
<br />
differently by different people.  In the philosophy of science, the 
<br />
prevailing view is that a theory, such as thermodynamics, reduces to 
<br />
statistical mechanics if statistical mechanics is able to explain the 
<br />
empirical success of thermodynamics, and explain its limitations.  For 
<br />
example, statistical mechanics is able to explain Brownian motion, which 
<br />
lies outside the scope of thermodynamics.  In fact, statistical mechanics 
<br />
provides a Whewellian consilience of chemical, thermodynamics, and Brownian 
<br />
inductions that is highlighted by the agreement of many independent 
<br />
measurements of Avogadro's number (as argued by Perrin in a book called 
<br />
Atoms around 1916).  The reductionist's view is that we should dispense with 
<br />
thermodynamics altogether.  In the case of statistical mechanics, it is 
<br />
supported by the Whewellian consilience of inductions achieved by 
<br />
statistical mechanics.
<br />
<p>On the other hand, for a long time, neither statistical mechanics nor 
<br />
thermodynamics (van der Waals theory) could account for the measured values 
<br />
of critical exponents in liquid to gas phase transitions, or phase 
<br />
transitions in ferromagnetism.  But there were some relatively simple 
<br />
phenomenological models used by physicists that modeled the phenomena 
<br />
successfully using power laws.  These laws were not reduced to statistical 
<br />
mechanics until very recently, when Wilson in 1971 used the method of 
<br />
renormalization borrowed from quantum field theory to derive an 
<br />
approximately correct set of critical exponents from a precise assumptions 
<br />
about the intermolecular forces.  It's safe to say that theories that manage 
<br />
to explain *some* disparate phenomena rarely, if ever, explain all the 
<br />
phenomena.  Neuroscience has not explained all psychological phenomena, and 
<br />
molecular genetics has not explained all biological phenomena.
<br />
<p>Whewell made a distinction between laws of phenomena, and laws of causes. 
<br />
Thermodynamic laws count as laws of phenomena, whereas the laws of 
<br />
statistical mechanics are laws of causes, in some liberal sense of 'cause'.
<br />
<p>This brings me to the other issue that Pedro has raised--whether we should 
<br />
view the sciences in terms of a strict hierarchy, in which physics informs 
<br />
all the special sciences, but is never informed by them, or whether a circle 
<br />
of sciences is a better metaphor because it allows that every science can be 
<br />
informed by any other science.  It seems to me that if the circle metaphor 
<br />
implies that connections between sciences are entirely symmetrical, then it 
<br />
says, incorrectly in my view, that statistical mechanics and thermodynamics 
<br />
have an equal status.  I agree that the strict reductionist view that falls 
<br />
out of a strict hierarchical view of science is too rigid.  A better view 
<br />
seems to be a mixture of both. After all, theories, such as statistical 
<br />
mechanics, have achieved a bone fide kind of consilience that has not, and 
<br />
will not, be achieved by any theory at the phenomenological level.  On the 
<br />
other hand, higher level theories, no matter how consilient, are in a 
<br />
constant state of development, which is driven by the development of less 
<br />
consilient phenomenological theories below them in the hierarchy.  There is 
<br />
a kind of coevolution between the levels.
<br />
<p>Whewell is someone who pushed for a hierarchical view of science, in which 
<br />
laws of phenomena are at the bottom and laws of causes are at top.  This is 
<br />
a hierarchy of theories, not disciplines.  He thought that laws of causes 
<br />
supersede laws of phenomena.  If this view implies that there is a point at 
<br />
which phenomenological research contribute nothing to the progress of 
<br />
science, then it is wrong.   The successful consilience of some inductions 
<br />
does not mark the end of science--there is always the consilience of new 
<br />
inductions.
<br />
<p>Malcolm
