Hi Stan, Colleagues
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Well, I will try to elaborate my speculations. Meanwhile I would like to ask
<br />
a copy of your thoughts on teleology in pdf. Thanks !
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way as to invite the possibility.
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Let's think of a tree as an example...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Which sentence of the two below looks like being 'more correct' ?
<br />
A) Tree grows because of a division of cells... (bottom-&gt;up, [causality])
<br />
B) Cells divide because they have to 'fill in' a tree... (top-&gt;down,
<br />
[purpose])
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
We are used to think explicitly of A), but the B) under closer examination
<br />
is also true, because the algorithms of protein synthesis  enocoded within
<br />
genes are results of the top-&gt;down interaction e.g. recorded by
<br />
environmental conditions: DNR&lt;-cell&lt;-tissue&lt;-organ&lt;-...&lt;-organism&lt;-..
<br />
&lt;-environment(ecosystem)&lt;-...&lt;-biosphere&lt;-... This recording is done at a
<br />
level of populations of individuals that survive - a record made, otherwise
<br />
the record is deleted- death of unfit individuals (one might think further
<br />
of deletion of unfit populations, ecosystems, biosphere...). So a purpose of
<br />
dividing cells is to grow into a tree able to exploit/survive specific
<br />
environmental conditions. Now it is hard to distinguish A) from B)  - they 
<br />
meet and invite' each other.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Or rephrasing the 1st law of thermodynamics:
<br />
A) all the change in internal energy of a system is in the form of work done
<br />
[causality]
<br />
B) work is done in order to change an internal energy of a system [purpose] 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I would think for an internal expansion/cooling observer within such an
<br />
expanding/cooling system it would be very hard if not possible at all to
<br />
know why all this happens - whether the system expands internally
<br />
(bottom-&gt;up), or is it expanded by the purpose (top-&gt;down). 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Universe being a closed system 'under heating' (let me use parallel with
<br />
gasses) has to follow the 1st law of thermodynamics and expand. Were it open
<br />
&nbsp;it wouldn't expand (sounds naive, but who knows, though...). Entropy
<br />
released by growing/emerging/computed systems may act as a heating source in
<br />
this case (human-made processors suffer from overheating caused by entropy
<br />
too). So maybe the fact that the Universe expands is also a proof that it is
<br />
externally closed. Well there may be yet another alternative with Universe
<br />
being not completely closed system - a growing tree also 'expands'...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When one sees 'something' moving bottom-&gt;up direction, then the one can
<br />
guess that 'something else' must necessarily move the opposite top-&gt;down way
<br />
&nbsp;That're invited possibilities and most likely any teleological question
<br />
always has two answers relating with both top-&gt;down and bottom-&gt;up chains of
<br />
reasoning. So if entropy moves 'up', what moves 'down' then ?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Maybe thinking that the Big bang is the reason of everything is just one
<br />
half of the truth... because the starting moment of
<br />
computing/emergence/growth events may well be a reason of the Big bang as
<br />
well...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
All the best
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A Calculus of Purpose - an essay by Arthur D. Lander published in PLoS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Volume 2, Issue 6, June 2004) deals with some aspects of teleology in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sciences with emphasis on complex systems in biology. Here is a link:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="../../www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/@request=get-document&doi=10">http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1371/journal.pbio.0020164
</em><br />
SS: I have just written a short text on this subject myself. Anyone
<br />
who wishs to see a copy can just request a pdf from me.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If one tried to describe a purpose of such a (complex) system in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy (2nd law), then from the discussions on FIS it would seem that both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statements below can be true at the same time:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) a purpose of a complex (e.g. organism, ecosystem, etc...) system is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;release entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) a purpose of a complex system is to reduce entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would it be more correct to specify the action place:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) a purpose of a complex (e.g. organism, ecosystem, etc...) system is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;release entropy in their environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) a purpose of a complex system is to reduce entropy internaly
</em><br />
SS: Yes this would be the correct reading in my view. The reason we
<br />
want to include the first statement (along with the now traditional second
<br />
statement) is, proximately, ecological, and utimately has to do with the
<br />
Second Law as a final cause of any activity, giving one, general,
<br />
explanation of WHY anything happens. Then, since 'why' questions are
<br />
seldom if ever constructed within modern science, this finality remains the
<br />
only one apparent in physico-chemical world.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then having hierarchical levels of systems (..., atom, molecule, ...,cell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tissue, organ, body,.., star, nebula, galaxy, etc...) in mind it would seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that entropy is sort of &quot;pushed out&quot; from smaller scales to larger, yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;larger, etc (following a 'scale up' direction).
</em><br />
SS: This scenario still, urgently, requires careful, mathematical (and
<br />
therefore excludes me!) treatment. In my view, equilibration proceeds at
<br />
different rates at different scales, so that, in a nested configuration of
<br />
systems, those at the smallest scale should be at any time nearer to
<br />
equilibrium than the larger scale ones. Of course, the very smallest scale
<br />
particles could never get to global equilibrium as long as they are
<br />
contained within larger scale systems. These would need to break down
<br />
first.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus if the Universe is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;closed system all what we call entropy should accumulate within. Otherwise
</em><br />
-
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it should be pushed yet &quot;somewhere up&quot;.
</em><br />
SS: Since the Universe is expanding at accelerated rate, we don't
<br />
have, yet, to worry about canonical distributions, or about power law
<br />
fluctuations either. As long as expansion continues to accelerate,
<br />
equilibration could never catch up.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Although Closed Universe has yet one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more alternative to &quot;fight&quot; accumulation of entropy by accelerating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expansion. Or vice versa - it is the entropy that forces the Universe to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expand... It lets to draw a speculative conclusion, that an accelerated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emergence of complexity may be a cause of Universe's accelerating expansion
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;May it be it so ?..
</em><br />
SS: Whew! I thought I was a cutting edge speculator! I hope you will
<br />
try to draw this picture in more detail for us. I am a bit suscpicious of
<br />
this kind of thought since it is basically bottom-&gt;up, the basic action
<br />
being from the lower levels. On my view of scale hierarchies, this could
<br />
not work unless the upper (larger scale) levels were configured in such a
<br />
way as to invite the possibility. Even if the sequence: decoherence -&gt;
<br />
strong force attractions -&gt; gravitation -&gt; organizing work is in some way
<br />
fundamental, remember that this is driven by the accelerated expansion of
<br />
the Big Bang, and so that that largest scale event is the global efficient
<br />
cause here.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some parallels (take it as a joke): Expansion acts like the only possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cooling mechanism for a closed computing system to prevent overheating of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the main processor :) by increasing computing loads.
</em><br />
SS: I don't see it as a joke at all. It is about time that computation
<br />
became more materialist in spirit. I have been calling for computation
<br />
energy use to be monitored closely, and to be programmable as well, so why
<br />
not expanding memories as a result of the computation well?
