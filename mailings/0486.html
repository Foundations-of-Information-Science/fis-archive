------------------
<br />
Dear Gyorgyi and Norbert:
<br />
<p>Thank you very much for your comments. Just a couple of points of
<br />
clarification:
<br />
<p>I think that perhaps a big part of our disagreement is purely semantic
<br />
(no pun intended!). As Karl Popper liked to say, one should not quarrel
<br />
about the meanings of words. On the other hand, if we can't agree on
<br />
what we mean by words, then we run the risk of misunderstanding each
<br />
other and talking past one another. So let me give my reasons again for
<br />
preferring to use &quot;information&quot; in the way that I do.
<br />
<p>First, I think it is crucial that &quot;information&quot; be understood as having
<br />
a semantic interpretation. Without any need for meaning to enter the
<br />
picture, I just don't see why we wouldn't use a purely physical term,
<br />
whether &quot;structure&quot;, or &quot;process,&quot; or &quot;dynamics,&quot; or something else. But
<br />
if that is so, then we should limit the word &quot;information&quot; to cases
<br />
where there is clearly a cognitive agent involved.
<br />
<p>When I speak of &quot;objective&quot; information, I just mean information that is
<br />
independent of the human observer---that is, information that would
<br />
still exist whether human beings existed or not. Gyorgyi wrote that what
<br />
I am calling &quot;intrinsic, observer-independent information&quot; is precisely
<br />
what he wants to call &quot;subjective.&quot; I think I see what he means. If I am
<br />
saying that every instance of information use in the true sense depends
<br />
upon some cognitive agent, then I guess there is a sense in which it
<br />
must be &quot;subjective,&quot; in the sense of being FOR a subject. But even so,
<br />
we still need to distinguish information FOR organism A as its own
<br />
subject from information ABOUT organism A as an object for
<br />
me-as-observer.
<br />
<p>When I say that information exists &quot;objectively,&quot; I mean that it exists
<br />
in the first sense, for other organisms as subjects in their own right,
<br />
whether I or any other human being observes them as objects or not. This
<br />
is kind of confusing, because of course I am simultaneously an
<br />
objectifying observer and also a subjective cognitive agent in my own
<br />
right with intrinsic information dynamics. So I am also like organism A
<br />
and have my own objective information that exists whether I am observed
<br />
from the outside or not. It was to avoid this confusion in the terms
<br />
&quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot; that I introduced the terms &quot;allotelic&quot;
<br />
(information ABOUT organism A FOR organism B) and &quot;autotelic&quot;
<br />
(information FOR organism A itself), but whatever we choose to call it,
<br />
I still feel that it is an important distinction, which we ignore at the
<br />
peril of great confusion.
<br />
<p>Of course, as Gyorgyi says, &quot;dynamical interactions characterise
<br />
physical processes as well.&quot; But I believe that there is a sui generis
<br />
dynamics of the living state which characterises information use in the
<br />
true sense. Probably no one else will agree with me here, so perhaps
<br />
this is the source of most of the confusion. I see all pre-living
<br />
dynamics as simply minimizing energy, whereas living dynamics is doing
<br />
WORK, i.e., not merely minimizing energy but guiding it in a
<br />
goal-directed way. More specifically, I think that information is the
<br />
means by which cognitive agents do work (attain their goals). More
<br />
specifically still, according to my dynamical model, information is a
<br />
low-energy trigger that correlates the higher-energy oscillation of a
<br />
nonlinear oscillator with the external conditions that will tend to
<br />
preserve its dynamical stability. Of course, explaining how all of this
<br />
is possible in terms of some recognizable laws of physics is a tall
<br />
order, mainly for the future (although Giuseppe Vitiello and others have
<br />
some interesting ideas). But however that may be, the issue with respect
<br />
to information is not dynamics per se, but a very special sort of
<br />
dynamics characteristic of the living state alone and constitutive of
<br />
information.  Or so I believe.
<br />
<p>Finally, Norbert says that &quot;matter, energy and information are bound in
<br />
inseparable unity,&quot; but that is clearly only true in the allotelic sense
<br />
of information, not the autotelic sense---at least if one is willing to
<br />
grant me that autotelic information emerged into existence only with the
<br />
advent of life and its sui generis dynamics as mentioned in the previous
<br />
paragraph. Before there was life and such a special dynamics, there was
<br />
simply no information at all in the autotelic sense. Sure, we can
<br />
interpret anything whatsoever as information in the allotelic sense, but
<br />
I do not see what advantage there is to reinterpreting physics in terms
<br />
of information theory, when the old-fashioned dynamical approach seems
<br />
to work just as well, with much less confusion.
<br />
<p>On second thought, perhaps it is not so much confusion that is the
<br />
issue, as a deep metaphysical disagreement. My chief concern is to
<br />
understand how the universe gave rise to life and mind. If we build
<br />
information into the foundations of  our physics, as Wheeler and Stonier
<br />
and Norbert and I believe John Collier and others wish to do, then we
<br />
are saying that the human being is at the center of existence. By
<br />
putting the human being logically before the cosmic evolutionary
<br />
process, we make it impossible
<br />
to understand the human being as an outcome of that process, and so make
<br />
it impossible to understand the human being in naturalistic terms at
<br />
all. In short, I see pan-informationism as either a gratuitious and
<br />
confusing misuse of terminology, or (what is worse, in my view) as a
<br />
form of idealism.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
<p>James
