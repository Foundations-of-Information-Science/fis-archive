                    Quoting Michael Devereux &lt;dbar_x&#64;cybermesa.com&gt;:
                    <br />
                <p>Thanks Michael for your cogent reply.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand Landauer's insight not as an analysis of the logical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of information, nor of its ubiquitous utility throughout
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; human endeavors, but rather as a more precise description of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanisms for storage and transmission of information.
                    </em><br />
                <p>I agree that 'storage and transmission of information' (if info is
                    <br />
                    predefined as
                    <br />
                    physical data carrying marks) is a useful description of the mechanism. But if
                    <br />
                    the data carry numbers and letters the information exchange process involves
                    <br />
                    qualia as well as quanta, implies structure shape and pattern (like anyons in
                    <br />
                    quantum knot theory imply two dimensional worlds). Human communication is
                    <br />
                    notoriously more complex than barcoding brains but we don't need to
                    <br />
                    resort to a
                    <br />
                    metaphysical account involving 'disembodied abstract entities' to explain the
                    <br />
                    rules (Descartes can crawl back into his oven - some axiom like Miller's 'plus
                    <br />
                    or minus 7' might suffice).
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose neuroscientists today may even be able to locate those
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific &gt;areas of the brain that process mathematical thoughts.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Yes, if info transmission is basically a physical process we should be able to
                    <br />
                    map its movement within the cerebellum (like Pinker maps verb tense usage in
                    <br />
                    the brain with MRI scans). The corollary of the physical view is that
                    <br />
                    'information' is (unlike concepts such as language, mind, consciousness or
                    <br />
                    number) not a distinct phenomenon but merely a feature of matter.
                    <br />
                <p>If info transmission is an 'event' (as Stanley and Rafael) suggest,
                    <br />
                    then what is
                    <br />
                    its essential structure? 'Any surprising such representing a range of suches'
                    <br />
                    perhaps? If so then any mere transmission of physical data (signals)
                    <br />
                    would only
                    <br />
                    qualify as information under certain conditions. It may be that information
                    <br />
                    'takes place' in the no-man's land of possibility between the ones and the
                    <br />
                    zeroes, between the lines of text, between noise and news and occurs deep
                    <br />
                    within the interstitial spaces of microtubular networks or in the sense-data
                    <br />
                    filtering mechanisms of the thalamus.
                    <br />
                <p>The anyon phenomenon may even have counterparts across the 'ubiquitous
                    <br />
                    utilities' of human endeavours - e.g.
                    <br />
                <p>rhetoric - homonyms, puns, metaphors
                    <br />
                    logic - paradoxical statements, nonsense
                    <br />
                    grammar - syntactic ambiguity, ambipositions
                    <br />
                    computing - wildcarding/regular expressions
                    <br />
                    card games - the joker (representing all the possible cards playable)
                    <br />
                    punctuation - asterisks (representing any of a range of swear words)
                    <br />
                <p>I suppose I am arguing that information transfer is not a transmission
                    <br />
                    of X from point A to point B but the act of in-form-ation becomes a
                    <br />
                    trans-form-ation to Y in the process (just as reading material print
                    <br />
                    can inform and transform the consciousness of a reader).
                    <br />
                <p>This 'mysterious transformation of raw information into cognitive content'
                    <br />
                    (Collier) remains the philosopher's stone of cognitive science.
                    <br />
                <p>The stone itself, of course, may be composed of neither bosons nor fermions.
                    <br />
                <p>Cheers,

                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Colleagues,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand Landauer's insight not as an analysis of the logical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of information, nor of its ubiquitous utility throughout
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; human endeavors, but rather as a more precise description of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanisms for storage and transmission of information. According to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Landauer, and I think he was right about this, information is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; exclusively stored in the configuration of physical objects,.and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; transmitted only by material entities. So, for example, the energy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration of a simple bi-level atom would contain a single bit of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, represented by zero, say, in its ground configuration,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; and by one in its excited level. Of course the physical configuration
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the atom's nucleus, made up of protons and neutrons, must also
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain additional information, ignored in this instance. And we know
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; that protons and neutrons are themselves composed of quarks, whose
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical configuration must also contain more information. And, as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as we know, those quarks may be constituted by some structure of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings, with even more information, and so on.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also understand Landauer to tell us that information is transmitted
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one thing to another only by physical objects, all of which are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; composed of energetic quanta. As, for instance, sending information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a telegraph line by a series of electrical impulses, each of which
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains many electrons. I know of no reason to suppose that the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information any person holds and exploits, even about mathematics, is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; not stored and transmitted physically, as Landauer has said.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jerry wrote that &quot;mathematics is often deemed as abstraction, (so)
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical information is often deemed as abstract.&quot; But, it is
                        the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain cells and synaptic connections, their chemical and electrical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration and signal processing, which alone permits us to employ
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics. Clearly, traumatic injury to the brain (or death, even)
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; can destroy a person's mathematical facility. I suppose
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuroscientists today may even be able to locate those specific areas
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the brain that process mathematical thoughts.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that those who might claim that physics is merely applied
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics, that it lacks any self standing domain, are certainly
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken. Those of us who are physical scientists recognize that our
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; models of the physical world must always be validated by tangible
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations in controlled experiments. That, I believe,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishes the physical sciences from pure mathematics. I have yet
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; to meet the chemist, biologist, geologist, paleontologist,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; astronomer, or physicist who seeks to treat matter itself as a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; disembodied abstract entity. Landauer certainly didn't do that, and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of us, also, I believe, clearly see the difference between a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical model of the physical world, and the world itself.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because we carefully observe that world in our experiments.
