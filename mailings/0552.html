FIS Friends--
<br />
<p>(I apologize for the length of this message.)
<br />
<p>I BASIC INTRODUCTION
<br />
<p>The discussion thus far seems obsessed with what utensils are at the 
<br />
table and less with of what the meal consists.
<br />
<p>FIS is inventing a science, and to my mind the orderly way to do so 
<br />
is to understand the use to which the science will be put. (You don't 
<br />
have to be an idealist about the world to believe that much of 
<br />
science is constructed.) I suggest that one promising use is to look 
<br />
at evolution, or emergent behavior if you wish. To be useful, the new 
<br />
science would more cleanly deal with mechanics than does what we have 
<br />
now. And it would do more than describe; it would predict.
<br />
<p>I have suggested elsewhere a specific dynamic, the examination of 
<br />
which might be fruitful. That dynamic goes beyond the impetus of some 
<br />
basic quality to organize, create structure and something persisting 
<br />
as the system's memory. It goes to the phenomenon I imperfectly call 
<br />
multilayer or multilevel systems. In Conrad's view, these are cells, 
<br />
brains, niches, and economy. (Thanks to Pedro, 16 May, for competent 
<br />
moderation in reintroducing the problem.) Other divisions of layers 
<br />
will be posited by others (elementary particles, molecules, cells, 
<br />
..); I have different ones in my artificial systems. The units are 
<br />
not important, what is important are boundaries between these 
<br />
systems-as-layers.
<br />
<p>The activity of cells produces two types of organization: a simple 
<br />
one for instance consisting of the society of cells, and a more 
<br />
complex one which defines the world of the higher level, say brains. 
<br />
The nature of this structure is a more interesting problem than that 
<br />
of the simple society, and one which I strongly believe will be the 
<br />
catalyst for developing a new science. The central problem is that 
<br />
&quot;information&quot; -centric activity in the lower level creates all the 
<br />
abstractions of the higher level: the largely new ontology and its 
<br />
physics. This &quot;vertical&quot; information flow and projected deep creation 
<br />
of new layers of the world is completely inscrutable using 
<br />
conventional constructs.
<br />
<p>I suggest that a new layer results when some complexity threshold is 
<br />
reached within a layer (a quantum entropy); also that there are some 
<br />
predictable formal dynamics that can predict the nature of the new 
<br />
ontology based on the nature of &quot;information&quot; activity within the 
<br />
layer. Probably that any observer has their own &quot;thirdness&quot; but 
<br />
locked within a single layer as a behavior of the that society (; and 
<br />
that examination of the thirdness of observation or signs within a 
<br />
layer is an interesting hobby but probably not one which promises new 
<br />
insights).
<br />
<p>II. A PROPOSAL ON MECHANICS
<br />
<p>Jim Cogswell (8 Apr) introduced the work of Michael Leyton into the 
<br />
discussion. That same day I posted some caveats for applying his 
<br />
notions to the FIS agenda, which is quite different than his. But I 
<br />
think many of his notions do provide some leverage. Our work here 
<br />
developed a similar approach in parallel.
<br />
<p>We believe that a basic problem in information studies is that the 
<br />
mechanics of first order logic is broken, meaning inadequate for 
<br />
these types of problems. Information concerning &quot;situation&quot; (which 
<br />
most will understand as &quot;systems context&quot;) needs to be explicitly 
<br />
represented, each fact then being &quot;situated.&quot; This is satisfied by 
<br />
using the robust situation logic developed in the 80's by Barwise and 
<br />
since greatly elaborated. Furthermore, the notion of situation STATE 
<br />
must be handled formally: a formal science of monads has developed in 
<br />
the computing community, including the new notion of multilevel 
<br />
monads.
<br />
<p>With this situation/monad awareness, one can naturally see the 
<br />
systems and subsystems of information transfers as groups. (Included 
<br />
in the groups are the structure of the abstractions involved, using 
<br />
related formalisms.) The dynamics of those groups can be seen in 
<br />
terms of symmetry operations (which in a reflexive manner can be 
<br />
characterized as groups...). It appears that at a certain level of 
<br />
complexity, groups can define operators that transform themselves 
<br />
(fibre bundles of abstract primitives) into a new &quot;layer&quot; of 
<br />
abstractions and information transfer behaviors. The key points here 
<br />
mirror Leyton's work.
<br />
<p>A restatement without the mathematical jargon: there seems to be a 
<br />
way to formally characterize/model information behavior within a 
<br />
system  so that the model explains and predicts the system's 
<br />
behavior. That description contains not only the physics of the 
<br />
system, but its metaphysics (its ontology and the methods of 
<br />
abstraction allowed). So far, nothing unique. But because the mere 
<br />
activity of the system is seen as the initiator of the abstraction 
<br />
mechanism, the system has the wherewithal to transform itself into a 
<br />
related &quot;child&quot; (&quot;parent?&quot;) at a higher level. The existence of the 
<br />
higher level depends on the lower, but has some distinctly different 
<br />
behavior. If this is true, and consistent within useful bounds, and 
<br />
indeed predicts behavior of interest, we may have some of the 
<br />
mechanics for the new FIS science.
<br />
<p>Note that the mechanics are based on symmetry operators. This is not 
<br />
the symmetry described by Darvas (8 Apr) which is morphology-centric, 
<br />
but the broader use of the term which would encapsulate time. But 
<br />
that's beyond my pay grade, as we used to say at my lab.
<br />
<p>III. SOME TOUCHSTONES WITH PRIOR COMMENTS
<br />
<p>I'm extremely optimistic about FIS developing not just a consensus, 
<br />
but one that is a breakthrough. I am not sufficiently talented to 
<br />
weave such a synthesis, but can relate a few onlist comments to the 
<br />
notion sketched above:
<br />
<p>Koichiro's note on the &quot;internalist&quot; view of John C. (6 May): I think 
<br />
this is a matter of preference, not truth. I prefer his &quot;negotiation&quot; 
<br />
model because it provides a methodology for the contextualization 
<br />
noted above. Similarly with &quot;potential&quot; info and mapping to abstract 
<br />
constructs. Concerning this, graphs and categories are more apt than 
<br />
numbers in my estimation.
<br />
<p>Pedro objects to John's &quot;incardinating&quot; info in physics and suggests 
<br />
three layers (cells, brains, firms) as an archetypical countercase. 
<br />
Firms (or as I would say, &quot;enterprises&quot;) are an extremely rich 
<br />
domain: rich in terms of interesting problems but also -- take note 
<br />
-- in terms of sponsorship for the new science. I understand John's 
<br />
view in my own way as the &quot;situating&quot; of physically generated 
<br />
information in physics; other layers (organic and non) are similarly 
<br />
situated. Most folks here seem to say something similar, even Edwina 
<br />
but with the possible exception of Gottfried. (Shu-Kun's brief 
<br />
comment on this hit home with me!)
<br />
<p>And Gottfried's contextualization in signs is universally accepted it 
<br />
seems, with the only exception being extension to layers where 
<br />
conventional observers do not exist. Søren's 5 levels (and 
<br />
accompanying work) addresses this rather well enough I think. Edwina 
<br />
objects to an enforced pansemiotician, and implicitly challenges us 
<br />
to devise a less charged framework paradigm. I take that as an FIS 
<br />
work item.
<br />
<p>Despite consequent religious differences about certain rootings, 
<br />
nearly everyone in their own way shares the same general 
<br />
discrimination of information, communication and structure (memory), 
<br />
with apparently minor syntactical nits. Most of these are related to 
<br />
the amusingly slippery game of &quot;consciousness,&quot; which we would do 
<br />
well to not play.
<br />
<p>Søren reports (21 May) on the Fuschl consensus. That could serve as a 
<br />
starting point for FIS futures. For my tastes, it is not strong 
<br />
enough. A good consensus separates out the tentatively settled from 
<br />
the agreed open issues. The nature of the &quot;metaheterarchy&quot;  and 
<br />
&quot;filtering&quot; are manifestly open grand challenges but noted as 
<br />
settled. Also, explanatory mechanics (autopoiesis) are confusingly 
<br />
mixed with problem descriptions. The levels noted here are more bound 
<br />
to the framework (physical, informational and semiotic causality) 
<br />
rather than the behavior (cells, brains, firms for instance) as 
<br />
Edwina notes (22 May). In that same message, she opens an interesting 
<br />
issue concerning self organized systems versus complex adaptive 
<br />
systems. I think this dissonance needs to be settled forthwith. I 
<br />
vote for both: the first as closed systems seen locally; the second 
<br />
for multilayer systems, the &quot;openness&quot; indicating the potential to 
<br />
project new information spaces.
<br />
<p>There has been much traffic on signs. I find this both intriguing and 
<br />
frustrating. Signs are an artifact of logic, and as noted above we 
<br />
need a new logic -- in part to escape such ineffable difficulties.
<br />
<p>IV. AN APPRECIATION
<br />
<p>Although my schedule forbids the kind of participation I would like, 
<br />
I consider this an extremely valuable group. Very courteous 
<br />
collaborative development of a new intellectualism. With a little bit 
<br />
of focus toward synthesizing some compromise terms, we can get down 
<br />
down to the real work, which could be significant.
<br />
<p>Our guidelines should be as undogmatic as possible. I think we must 
<br />
take it as empirical proof that no workable framework exists 
<br />
(Bertalanffy fundamentalism notwithstanding) so we need to do some 
<br />
engineering of the metaphysic. What concepts are leverageable and 
<br />
frangible are the issues and they need to be addressed in terms of 
<br />
what the new science adds.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
