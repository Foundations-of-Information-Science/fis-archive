I have passed along this story to a colleague here who studies Sephardic culture, hoping that it might spark some interest.
<br />
<p>Many thanks.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           Walter Ruby - Special To The Jewish Week (March 16, 2001)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One day in the summer of 2000, an archivist in the magnificent medieval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cathedral of the northern Spanish town of Tarazona found that the cover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a 14th-century book in the church's collection of manuscripts had been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ripped. Examining the book closely, he discovered that inside the cover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was an until-then undetected document written in Hebrew that had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently been inserted into the cover hundreds of years ago to help
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hold the book together. The Hebrew text was a synagogue document from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tarazona's long-lost Jewish community, which like the rest of Spanish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jewry, was expelled from the country in 1492.   Excited by the discovery,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the archivist informed Javier Bona, a local archaeologist who only months
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier had created an organization known as The Association of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Friends of Jewish Culture-Moshe De Portella, named for a Jew from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tarazona who was a legendary financier for the King of Aragon during the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 13th century. Spurred on by Bona, a team of archivists peeled back the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covers of a number of other venerable volumes preserved in the cathedral,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and found to their great excitement that these books too had been held
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together by inserting inside their covers Jewish documents which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously had been confiscated by the local Catholic Church. In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; months since, the archivists have discovered some 60 of these medieval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hebrew documents; an assortment of legal deeds and religious writings,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including one that is written in Arabic with Hebrew lettering. These
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique documents are proving invaluable to Bona and other members of his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; association in fleshing out the life of the long-disappeared Jewish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; community of the town.   Mention the glory of Spanish Jewry in the days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before the Inquisition and what comes immediately to mind are the southern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cities of Cordoba and Granada, where giants of Jewish history like Moses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maimonides and Yehuda Halevi lived and wrote, and where highly literate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jewish communities helped the Muslim leaders of Spain create a glorious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; civilization at a time when Christian Europe was slumbering in the Dark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ages. Another city where Jewish life flourished before the Inquisition is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Toledo, the beautiful former capital of Castille, located near Madrid in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; central Spain, which, like Cordoba and Granada, is today much visited by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jewish tourists from around the world.   But until now, there has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost no awareness in the Jewish world of the Judaic legacy of Tarazona
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and other ancient towns in the northern kingdom of Aragon, whose King
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ferdinand married Castilian Queen Isabella and united their kingdoms to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form modern Spain.   That ignorance and neglect are expected to come to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an end this summer when Tarazona, a gemlike medieval town of 12,000 set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a verdant plain below towering Mt. Moncayo about halfway between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mediterranean and the Atlantic, hosts a festival called &quot;The Return of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sepharad to Tarazona. The festival, to be held on July 27-28, will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attended by the Israeli ambassador to Spain, Aragonese and Spanish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; government officials and Jewish dignitaries from around the world. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two-day event will feature an exhibition of the recently discovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hebrew manuscripts of the town at the venerable palace of the bishop of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the city; the presentation of a new book on the history of Tarazona
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jewry; a celebration of the cuisine of the Jews of Spain and a concert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; featuring medieval Sephardic music.   (For more information check the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; website, <a href="../../portella.pvirt.com/default.htm">http://portella.pvirt.com</a>.)   There will also be walking tours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Juderia (Jewish Quarter), an area of the old town which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retained its name among the local population even though there have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no Jews living there in 500 years. Expected to take part in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; festivities will be Israeli and Palestinian children who will attend a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; peace camp in the town this summer under the auspices of the government
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Aragon and Encounter, an on-line community for Jewish-Arab
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconciliation.   The Jewish renaissance in Tarazona is likely to prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only the tip of the iceberg in a coming revival of interest in and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge about the long forgotten Jews of Aragon. According to Bona,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Like Tarazona, virtually every old city in Aragon has a Juderia, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until recently, no one seemed to care who those Jews had been and what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their lives had been like. We were motivated to investigate the story of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Jews of Tarazona not simply out of academic interest, but from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conviction that it is time to do justice, however late, to Sepharad by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recovering the memory of the Jews of Tarazona. We must rescue a corner of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the past for our common future.&quot;   Bona said there is evidence of Jewish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life in Tarazona and neighboring towns going back to Roman times. He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noted that the Jews of Tarazona had a close relationship with the kings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and queens of Aragon, going back to Moshe De Portella in the 13th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; century, who was the equivalent of the Rothschilds in his era. Around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1370, after Tarazona had nearly been destroyed in a ruinous war between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Castille and Aragon, the Jews of Tarazona financed the rebuilding of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; city's walls. When a massive pogrom against the Jews swept across Spain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in 1391, Tarazona was the only town in which the mayor issued an edict -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the text of which still can be found in the municipal archives -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; promising stern punishment against anyone who committed violence against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jews. The Jewish community of Tarazona remained intact until 1492, when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the union of Castile and Aragon, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decreed the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.   Visitors to the Juderia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today will find a rabbit's warren of narrow alleys and Spanish and Moorish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; style buildings, most of them still lived in, which has changed little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the passage of centuries. Several of the buildings, which are built
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on top of natural rock formations, are known as the &quot;hanging houses.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Below them are caves, which also evidently served as rooms in the homes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of residents of the Jewish Quarter. In the past year, through use of old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maps and documents discovered in the Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bona has managed to figure out the function of many of these buildings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the 13th and 14th century when the Juderia was at its height.   In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the center of the quarter is a large ruined dwelling that retains an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ornate door from medieval times, which apparently served as a Talmud
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Torah, which has clear evidence of a mikveh in the basement. Bona said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the Association of the Friends of Jewish Culture of Tarazona is now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking for the funding necessary to do a full restoration of this house,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which it plans to place a museum devoted to the life of the Jews of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tarazona. Nearby are buildings that have been identified by Bona as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synagogue and a butcher shop.   The Juderia is a three-minute walk from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tarazona's ornate city hall, which has a magnificent frieze on its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exterior depicting the coronation of Emperor Charles V of Spain and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Germany during the 16th century. The Cathedral and other venerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; buildings of Tarazona are built in the distinctive &quot;mudejar style,&quot; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delicate lace-like form of brickwork which was created by Muslim master
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artisans in Aragon and other provinces even after the re-conquest of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; areas by the Christians.   Another unique sight in the town is the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabited bullring in the world, a creaky-looking circular structure that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today contains the apartments of families who hang their laundry from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balconies from which audiences cheer the matadors.   People in Tarazona
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem gratified that they are finally beginning the process of healing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 500-year-old wound by celebrating the Jewish heritage of the town. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are also evidently excited by the possibility that they will soon see a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surge of Jewish visitors, which would give a needed economic boost to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; town that despite its beauty and antiquity, has hitherto been far from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the beaten tourist track. &quot;We look forward to welcoming home to Tarazona
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today the descendants of the Jews forced to leave here in 1492,&quot; said the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; town's mayor, Javier Calavia. &quot;That will be a kind of symbolic closing of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the circle, and will open us to the world in a way we have not been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before.&quot; Officials of the Aragonese government in the capital city of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zaragoza, an hour's drive from Tarazona, point out that their own city of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 700,000 also has a rich history of harmony between Christians, Jews and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muslims and has much tourist interest as well. Zaragoza's jewel in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crown is clearly the Aljaferia, a sprawling castle and fortress built by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Muslim conquerers of Zaragoza in the 10th century that later became
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the palace of the Christian kings of Aragon. Today the castle houses the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cortes (Parliament) of Aragon. Jose Maria Mur, president of the Cortes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said, &quot;We hope the Aljaferia will serve as a place of encounter for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former Jewish and Muslim communities of Aragon. Let them come home and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconnect to their Aragonese roots,&quot; Juan Carlos Trillo, Aragon's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambassador to the central government in Madrid, remarked. &quot;We are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gratified that Aragon is finally coming to terms with the terrible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; injustice of the expulsion of our Jews, which not only devastated their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lives, but did grievous damage to Aragon itself and the rest of Spain.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Manuel Blasco, director of Zaragoza 2008, an effort by the city to win
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the right to host the World Expo of 2008, noted that Zaragoza has applied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a United Nations designation as a &quot;City of Peace.&quot;   &quot;Having been the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scene of religious persecution in the past,&quot; he said, &quot;we in Aragon hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to build a brighter future by making a significant contribution to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; peacemaking and conflict resolution in the years ahead.&quot;
