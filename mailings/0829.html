<br />
Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>thanks for stimulating the debate on social information, Pedro.
<br />
<p>I believe that it's the task of FIS to work out an evolutionary theory of
<br />
information that stretches from physics to biology, psychology and
<br />
sociology. It's not impossible to theorise the social level, but it is
<br />
certainly not easy because it incorporates all physical and biological
<br />
information generation and processing. On the other hand this increased
<br />
complexity doesn't mean that its impossible for us to deal with social info
<br />
on a theoretical level.
<br />
<p>I believe there are two main paradigms concerning the concept of 
<br />
information in society: The translation of the Shannon/Weaver-model into 
<br />
society, social information is here conceived as a thing that is 
<br />
transmitted from a sender to a receiver, exchanged, stored, processed etc.
<br />
Contrary to that, Niklas Luhmann stresses that information can't be
<br />
transmitted because it would be a quality of cognitive systems, a 
<br />
difference that makes a difference that is selected in a communication 
<br />
process. Information here is one of three communicative selections, it is a 
<br />
property of cognition.
<br />
<p>I think both are right. Social information is a relationship, it has both
<br />
subjective and objective aspects. On the individual level, information
<br />
exists as cognitive property, it is selected in a communicative process.
<br />
Communication means a social dimension of information. Whenever people 
<br />
enter social relationships, an information relationship is established, 
<br />
messages, codes, symbols etc. are exchanged. Social information is also an 
<br />
objective, reflective social relationship: If actors communicate, 
<br />
information exists as an objective relationship between them and this 
<br />
relationship involves reflection. Reflection (Widerspiegelung) doesn't mean 
<br />
the mechanical reproduction of data by a receiver, it only means that in 
<br />
the case of communication there is a reaction of one communication partner 
<br />
to the symbolic actions of the other partner. It is determined that he 
<br />
reacts and in this reactions he makes uses of symbols, otherwise one 
<br />
couldn't speak of communication. But it is not determined how he reacts 
<br />
exactly, this is relatively open, but frequently also to a certain extent 
<br />
predictable due to certain regularities and standardised modes of behaviour 
<br />
that can be found in the social world.
<br />
<p>Social structures are more permanent social relationships. They are a form 
<br />
of social information, they store and fix knowledge and hence they simplify 
<br />
actions and communications because the foundations of these processes don't 
<br />
have to be produced permanently, they can be achieved by making use of 
<br />
structures. They are a sort of informational brain of society. Social 
<br />
information in this sense refers to what Bob Artigiani calls VEMS (Values, 
<br />
Ethicals, Morals), but not only. VEMS are just the cultural aspect of 
<br />
social info, but also e.g. technologies, property structures, political 
<br />
power structures, laws, traditions, spatio-temporal structures, 
<br />
non-codified and codified rules etc. store information about society. If 
<br />
this were only the case with VEMs, one would indeed as Pédro says neglect 
<br />
biological and physical structures.
<br />
<p>But the human being is embedded into nature and there's and exchange of 
<br />
matter and energy (and probably information) with nature in order for
<br />
society to exist. Man appropriates nature in order to exist, nature is a
<br />
property of society (and society a quality of nature) that gets embedded
<br />
into social structures like resources, goods and technologies. Physical and
<br />
biological information is embedded into social information structures, 
<br />
human production and labour are the ways of incorporating nature, a 
<br />
necessary pre-condition of society, into society.
<br />
<p>Godó is right that communication is a new quality of information at the
<br />
social level, but I believe that there are others too like e.g. 
<br />
self-consciousness, labour, production, culture, design, expectation,
<br />
anticipation, imagination, creativity, co-operation. All these activities
<br />
mean subjective and/or objective information production and the
<br />
incorporation of information from prior levels of the evolutionary hierarchy
<br />
into newly produced social information.
<br />
<p>Christian
