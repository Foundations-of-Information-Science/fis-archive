                <p>
                    Sorry to have been absent from the conversation.
                    <br />
                <p>The topic puzzles me, and prompts me once again to suggest that FIS
                    <br />
                    needs if not a single clean statement of why we come here, at least a
                    <br />
                    few so we can refer to them.
                    <br />
                <p>The presumption is - at least in the first posts - that information
                    <br />
                    is something at the root of how the world works. Ethics in some form
                    <br />
                    may be also, so it makes sense to consider the relationship between
                    <br />
                    the two to glean insights into either. Subsequent comments have
                    <br />
                    drifted into discussions of ethics outside this useful notion, which
                    <br />
                    only Rafael's first question addresses.
                    <br />
                <p>I rephrase that question here: &quot;What is it about the way that
                    <br />
                    physics, chemistry, biology work (or how we model how they work) that
                    <br />
                    can be seen as &quot;natural law&quot; and how does that relate as analogy (or
                    <br />
                    closer) to ethics and morality?&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Karl's notion is based on autoregulated behavior, conflating the
                    <br />
                    agent that conveys information with the one that regulates (and
                    <br />
                    sets?) rules over that information. He then suggests that a mechanism
                    <br />
                    can be built to rationally fold these responibilities, thereby
                    <br />
                    assuring us that we need not think in terms of analogies, but
                    <br />
                    constant principles that apply at all levels.
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro suggests in contrast that whatever the mechanics of information
                    <br />
                    and ethics, they are likely far apart. He implicitly assumes ethics
                    <br />
                    is intrinsic to the &quot;external view&quot; and therefore human, so it can be
                    <br />
                    applied only at the top level, what he calls &quot;closure.&quot; He later
                    <br />
                    suggests a link in &quot;fittedness&quot; that percolates up and is seen
                    <br />
                    looking &quot;down,&quot; then speculates on that fittedness (ethical
                    <br />
                    &quot;constraints&quot;) driving Darwinian complexity and competence. A
                    <br />
                    connection is made to ethics perhaps this informing the &quot;definitions
                    <br />
                    of information&quot; conundrum. Still later, he avers that &quot;morals&quot; as the
                    <br />
                    code may be more tenable as this &quot;informing the definitions of
                    <br />
                    information&quot; task.
                    <br />
                <p>Michael N makes the link to art and meaning, primarily speaking to
                    <br />
                    other of Rafael's questions. Though he doesn't explicitly make the
                    <br />
                    link with the first question there may be a connection between what
                    <br />
                    he calls &quot;new technologies&quot; and new formal constructions to describe
                    <br />
                    nonhuman information flows. Thus, we implicitly inherit some of the
                    <br />
                    pandisciplinary perspectives from the prior conversation on art and
                    <br />
                    whether molecules make art.
                    <br />
                <p>Stan also sticks to the human side in worrying about how to
                    <br />
                    re-engineer current trends in societal information flows to reinstate
                    <br />
                    ethics, or the efficacy of ethics. If one extends this to all
                    <br />
                    information flows (not Stan's intent to be sure), then the notion
                    <br />
                    becomes truly interesting.
                    <br />
                <p>John H (if I understand the formatting of the email correctly)
                    <br />
                    suggests that independent of information, ethics requires a
                    <br />
                    source/force beyond information that compels, and allows that it
                    <br />
                    spans both the artificial and natural. In terms of information being
                    <br />
                    that which &quot;makes a difference,&quot; ethics may be a difference, or
                    <br />
                    indicate one.
                    <br />
                <p>Jerry wonders if the notion of &quot;coding&quot; ethics is &quot;in&quot; the message or
                    <br />
                    can be, or whether it conveys or is sustained by another means.
                    <br />
                <p>Rafael reports the notion of a &quot;descriptive ethics&quot; which are in a
                    <br />
                    key sense reflective and bridge the inside and outside of the
                    <br />
                    &quot;message.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Viktoras sustains Pedro's notion of fittedness, coming at it from the
                    <br />
                    complementary perspective of &quot;glue&quot; of societies (which I would read
                    <br />
                    as complex systems of all kinds). However, her notion is more severe
                    <br />
                    than Pedro's in the sense that the elements each have agency
                    <br />
                    sufficiently to &quot;know&quot; how they fit into the system and are ensured
                    <br />
                    of the quality of their existence. In other words, the ethics provide
                    <br />
                    the framework for the context and hence the assembly.
                    <br />
                <p>Michael L chimes in with the obverse notion, Paraphrasing, he opines
                    <br />
                    that each entity (he means human) can only be whole, integrated, in a
                    <br />
                    context of ethics. He implies that ethics is essential to this (and
                    <br />
                    sufficient?). Such integrated beings are already &quot;pre-assembled&quot; in a
                    <br />
                    way to form societies as a byproduct.
                    <br />
                <p>It is Michael's message that prompts me to enter. Naturally I agree
                    <br />
                    with nearly everyone who has written on this. But there is a
                    <br />
                    difference between being correct, insightful and true on this issue
                    <br />
                    and being useful in a particular context.
                    <br />
                <p>I am again at the beginning of a new project. This one will be more
                    <br />
                    ambitious than the last, as is always the case. For those who don't
                    <br />
                    know me, I design large synthetic worlds that interact with &quot;real&quot;
                    <br />
                    ones (or one, as you prefer). You might think of this as AI, but it
                    <br />
                    is hardly artificial. The goal is to replicate rather than model.
                    <br />
                <p>Generally, this fails when using conventional means. It is only
                    <br />
                    approachable if some new paradigm is used. The one I prefer sees the
                    <br />
                    world in terms of functions or transforms instead of particles,
                    <br />
                    objects, beings. With a talented colleague, we presented some
                    <br />
                    elements of this approach at Jerry's very fine symposium last month.
                    <br />
                <p>The point I wish to make is that functional interactions make the
                    <br />
                    nature of the information conveyed more apparent and it is quite
                    <br />
                    feasible to describe the world in terms of these &quot;messages&quot; and the
                    <br />
                    processes they invoke. What's more difficult is understanding why.
                    <br />
                <p>My collaborator and I have been working on structured urges. Now
                    <br />
                    understand, these are urges of molecules as well as humans, and in
                    <br />
                    our alternative abstractions roughly substitute for &quot;forces and
                    <br />
                    fields.&quot; And they don't behave smoothly and always deterministically.
                    <br />
                <p>So this topic of ethics is apt, very apt for my present work. For me,
                    <br />
                    when I read &quot;ethics&quot; in the emails, I think in terms of the larger
                    <br />
                    set of driving motives, and though nearly all the discussion deals
                    <br />
                    with persons, I necessarily extend it to all interactions. No matter
                    <br />
                    how various are our notions of what FIS is, the idea that the
                    <br />
                    principles of information span scale is what binds us in this group,
                    <br />
                    yes?
                    <br />
                <p>I prefer Michael Leyton's viewpoint. Its because you have to assume
                    <br />
                    that whatever the urges, they are attached to and satisfy in some
                    <br />
                    way, the individual. Defining a society as the collection of
                    <br />
                    ethically-bound entities and then imputing the ethics derive somehow
                    <br />
                    from society seems circular to me.
                    <br />
                <p>Michael also has some ideas about memory and structure that are
                    <br />
                    useful to me because they allow a formal mechanics and fit rather
                    <br />
                    handily into what it means to &quot;see and know&quot; something in our way of
                    <br />
                    describing the world.
                    <br />
                <p>So let me propose a few ideas concerning ethics and information:
                    <br />
                <p>Starting with the ordinary notion of &quot;things&quot; and information and how
                    <br />
                    things organize into societal-like structures that become other
                    <br />
                    things and so on... FIS supposes that thinking in terms of
                    <br />
                    information can provide some new and perhaps universal insights.
                    <br />
                    There must be some motivating element that persists in attachment to
                    <br />
                    the object as it sends and receives messages. This would be beyond
                    <br />
                    matters of grammar and have some evaluative component. It would
                    <br />
                    necessary benefit the object by itself in some way, but at the same
                    <br />
                    time drive structured, presumably stable associations that benefit
                    <br />
                    the system and (most) of its constituents.
                    <br />
                <p>It should be modifiable/evolvable by the messages (using Jerry's word
                    <br />
                    here). It needs to have identity societally and individually though
                    <br />
                    they need not be the same, though I expect some reflexive dynamics to
                    <br />
                    be the case.
                    <br />
                <p>This is how I think of the category of stuff that we've denoted as
                    <br />
                    ethics. I think if we reason this way, we need some new definitions
                    <br />
                    of ethics to fit the more universal case. The ethics we know (or
                    <br />
                    think we do) in the human case would be only one instance.
                    <br />
                <p>If this were the case, and we started, say, with chemistry and
                    <br />
                    biomolecular networks, then I think we might say something useful
                    <br />
                    about protoethics or whatever we wish to call them.
                    <br />
                <p>When we make the switch from ordinary particle/noun representations
                    <br />
                    to Ted's urge/verb ones, most thing are turned inside out. The urges
                    <br />
                    become the agents, messages transform but some basic mechanics of
                    <br />
                    information should be the same in both paradigms. I presume this to
                    <br />
                    include the protoethic.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Sorry for the long message.
                    <br />
                <p>Best, Ted
                    <br />
