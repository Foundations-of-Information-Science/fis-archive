                <p>Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
                    <br />
                    issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many
                    <br />
                    significant news releases indicate strong contractual
                    <br />
                    revenues with major Telecom firms.
                    <br />
                <p>SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications
                    <br />
                    giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4
                    <br />
                    years, but is now projecting &quot;a banner expansion year with
                    <br />
                    geometric growth in revenues&quot; due largely to sales demands
                    <br />
                    for their innovative patented products and expansion into
                    <br />
                    International telecom markets.
                    <br />
                <p>Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader
                    <br />
                    that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior
                    <br />
                    patented outside plant electrical surge protection
                    <br />
                    equipment for the telecommunications industry.
                    <br />
                    The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion
                    <br />
                    annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the
                    <br />
                    expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate
                    <br />
                    the industry.
                    <br />
                <p>SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest
                    <br />
                    quality &quot;protection element&quot; for complex digital switches.
                    <br />
                    Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to
                    <br />
                    inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions
                    <br />
                    in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus
                    <br />
                    negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.
                    <br />
                    Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their
                    <br />
                    network in order to prevent the hazards of harming
                    <br />
                    personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive
                    <br />

                <p>How many times have you seen issues explode but you

                    couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right
                    <br />
                    information in time? We are alerting you now to a special
                    <br />
                    Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront
                    <br />
                    of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology
                    <br />
                    and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with
                    <br />
                    Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases
                    <br />
                    in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal
                    <br />
                    advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in
                    <br />
                    this industry group that is unknown and undervalued,
                    <br />
                    therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.
