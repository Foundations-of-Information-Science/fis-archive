<p>
Anthony Booth &lt;abooth&#64;IEE.ORG&gt; has sent me the following, I would say 
<br />
not only sensible but also VERY CONSTRUCTIVE message:
<br />
<p>Dear elohimjl,
<br />
<p>Your thesis is interesting, but your presentation shows too much fear.
<br />
<p>Humans fear many things, but high on the list is fear itself ... fear in
<br />
others that is.  These monologues deal with important matters.  However
<br />
they come over in a shrill tone of voice, as though the hand guiding the
<br />
pen is shaking (please forgive my metaphors).  If such encyclopaedic
<br />
fearfulness is presented to a person whose normal ambit is a cheerful
<br />
everyday round, even perhaps a person intoxicated to some degree by the
<br />
sweetness of their life, then the prospect presented is repugnant and
<br />
creates an immediate revulsion.  Down that road is merely an alienation of
<br />
the greater readership of such arguments.
<br />
<p>Instead it falls to the presenter of such arguments to display (or at least
<br />
to fake) a courageous and statesmanlike stance.  The inclusion of pivotal
<br />
positive arguments is crucial.  That is the style which is likely to hold
<br />
the attention of and draw toward it those in whom a change of mental model
<br />
is needed.  Fear tends to drive people back into using their tried and
<br />
proven existing models without further thought.  At best it brings about
<br />
disruption of existing social concepts to allow competition amongst new
<br />
ones, but that is just the same mechanism as war.
<br />
<p>It is fair to expect that a community of persons with a cybernetics
<br />
interest are unlikely to be fools enough to reject outright the totality of
<br />
what you are saying, but nevertheless a message of this sort needs
<br />
transformation into a courageous and stylish presentation with rigour and
<br />
strength of expression.  It is good that you have the opportunity to
<br />
present your message in this primordial form within the restricted channels
<br />
of such a cybernetics network.  However, I suspect that even cyberneticians
<br />
are subject to feelings of fear, just as is anybody else.  So these issues
<br />
even matter here.
<br />
<p>How does cybernetics deal with this issue of fear ... in theory and,
<br />
perhaps more importantly just now, in practice?
<br />
<p>His question could be extended to other domains saying
<br />
<p>How does cybernetics, systems, information, organization, science, 
<br />
management, behavioral concern,...  deal with this issue of fear ... 
<br />
in theory and, perhaps more importantly just now, in practice?
<br />
<p>So far so difficult, complicated and nearly to be impossible if the 
<br />
scientific community does not support  the masses in their 
<br />
willingness to STOP all kinds of WARRING which continue being 
<br />
organized by - you know WHO - intelligent specimens wh have developed 
<br />
an effective expertise for inventing and using all kinds of military, 
<br />
economic, cultural and political weapons.
<br />
<p>Many of us are quite inclined to perform pragmatically supported by 
<br />
common sense decorated with some scientific information. Such a kind 
<br />
of attitude may help some individuals and even groups of them to 
<br />
escape from the frightening reality while encouraging themselves to 
<br />
attend immediately one or another symptom of the serious illness that 
<br />
suffers humankind at present. They may even claim  that they have 
<br />
very successfully save their souls.
<br />
<p>I am inclined to think differently, assuming that I put my feet on 
<br />
the terrestrial soul but my brain willing at least to notice 
<br />
something else of the whole reality in addition to what I have 
<br />
managed to comprehend.
<br />
<p>Humans have been increasingly ill since those days when rather few of 
<br />
our ancestors started to organize the civilized way of life by means 
<br />
of a generalized and unilateral utilitarianism for the sake of making 
<br />
profit and taking advantage of everything instead of learning to 
<br />
develop our intrinsic gregariousness
<br />
<p>Once again I dare to argue that we need URGeNTLY  to create the 
<br />
required circumstances for updating continuously a holistic view of 
<br />
our suffering Wholeness (our homosphere located in our biosphere 
<br />
located as well in our ecosphere, bearing in mind that these three 
<br />
spheres are ours only for the time being because the three belong 
<br />
always the following generation).
<br />
<p>How? Sorry to repeat again that our unique option is to develop the 
<br />
Bertalanffian Systems Thinking by means of Top ==&gt; Down approach(es)
<br />
<p>According  to Washington-based  Worldwatch Institute (see notice 
<br />
below) very short time is left for doing what is needed which should 
<br />
consistent enough with the features of our species and coherent 
<br />
enough with our planet (the only one available for human life)
<br />
<p><p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br />
<p><p>One generation all that is left to save world, report warns
<br />
<p>Paul Brown
<br />
The Guardian Weekly 20-3-0116, page 5
<br />
<p>The human race has only one or perhaps two generations to rescue 
<br />
itself, according to the 2003 State of the World report by the 
<br />
Washington-based Worldwatch Institute.The longer that no remedial 
<br />
action is taken, the greater the degree of misery and biological 
<br />
impoverishment that humankind must be prepared to accept, the 
<br />
institute says in its 20th annual report.
<br />
<p>Overuse of resources, pollution and destruction of natural areas 
<br />
continue to threaten life on the planet.
<br />
<p>Conditions continue to deteriorate rapidly, the report says, although 
<br />
there are some hopeful signs in that technical solutions to the 
<br />
problems have been found and - where there is political will - 
<br />
adopted. In most cases, though, nothing is being done.
<br />
<p>Among the worst trends is that 420 million people live in countries 
<br />
that no longer have enough crop land to grow their own food and have 
<br />
to rely on imports. Around 1.2 billion people, or about a fifth of 
<br />
the world's population, live in absolute poverty - defined as 
<br />
surviving on the equivalent of less than $1 a day. About one-quarter 
<br />
of the developing world's crop land is being degraded, and the rate 
<br />
is increasing. The greatest threat is not a shortage of land, says 
<br />
the report, but a shortage of water, with more than 500 million 
<br />
people living in regions prone to chronic drought.
<br />
<p>By 2025 that number is likely to have increased at least fivefold, to 
<br />
between 2.4 billion and 3.4 billion. A  probable world population 
<br />
increase of 27% by then will create social and ecological instability.
<br />
<p>Global warming is accelerating, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
<br />
has reached 370.9 parts per million, the highest level for 420,000 
<br />
years and probably for 20m years.
<br />
<p>Toxic chemicals are being released in increasing quantities, and 
<br />
global production of hazardous waste has reached more than 300m 
<br />
tonnes a year. There is only a vague idea of what damage this does to 
<br />
humans and natural systems, the report says. Another threat is 
<br />
movement of invasive species to regions where they can pose problems 
<br />
to native species.
<br />
<p>The state of the world's natural life support system is perhaps the 
<br />
most worrying indicator for the future, says the report. About 30% of 
<br />
the world's surviving forests are seriously fragmented or degraded, 
<br />
and they are being cut down at the rate of 130,000 sq km a year, it 
<br />
says.
<br />
<p>Wetlands have been reduced by 50% over the past century. Coral reefs 
<br />
are suffering the effects of overfishing, pollution, epidemic 
<br />
diseases and rising temperatures.
<br />
<p>A quarter of the world's mammal species and 12% of the birds are in 
<br />
danger of extinction.
<br />
<p>On the hopeful side, the report says that renewable energy 
<br />
technologies have now developed sufficiently to supply the world. 
<br />
They could significantly reduce the threat to the world from 
<br />
pollution - but currently there is a lack of political will to 
<br />
introduce them fast enough.
