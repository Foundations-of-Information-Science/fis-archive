Dear FIS colleagues:
<br />
<p>Below is a text version of my kickoff text. For a WORD format paper, see
<br />
attachment.
<br />
<p>I suggest that we divide the session into three sequential parts,
<br />
respectively focusing on each one of the three questions formulated in the
<br />
title below. And since this is a FIS (capital I!) conference, I suggest to
<br />
emphasize the information-science point of view. 
<br />
<p>I look forward to a lively, maybe at times cacophonic, electronic intercourse!
<br />

WHAT IS MUSIC? 
<br />
WHY IS THERE MUSIC? 
<br />
COULD THERE BE MUSIC ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE? 
<br />
<p>Juan G. Roederer
<br />
Geophysical Institute
<br />
University of Alaska-Fairbanks 
<br />
<p>Astrobiologists, in their quest to achieve an understanding of how life
<br />
formed here on Earth and whether life-like systems could exist elsewhere in
<br />
the Universe, are addressing very basic questions concerning expressions of
<br />
human-like intelligence such as music. However, before investigating the
<br />
possibility of existence of music elsewhere in the Cosmos, we must have a
<br />
clear idea of what we are looking for. This requires agreeing on what music
<br />
is from strictly objective informational, physical and biological points of
<br />
view, as much as possible detached from location- and time-specific cultural
<br />
circumstances. Only then can we try to speculate about those characteristic
<br />
signatures which we may expect in &quot;musical manifestations&quot; from
<br />
extraterrestrial beings with intelligent information-processing systems. 
<br />
<p>Concerning the first question of the title, namely what music really is, our
<br />
discussion should center on two major groups of basic attributes: (i) those
<br />
pertaining to physical, physiological and neural acoustical information
<br />
processing mainly involving complex tones, their superpositions and
<br />
sequences; and (ii) those related to the human being's emotional response to
<br />
music. In the former we should focus on &quot;cultural invariants&quot;, i.e.,
<br />
universals such as chroma, consonance and scales, which today are believed
<br />
to be linked directly to the sensory and cognitive mechanisms of acoustical
<br />
information processing  (e.g., see Roederer, J. G., The physics and
<br />
psychophysics of music, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1995). Concerning the
<br />
second group we should discuss the implications of the interactive, coherent
<br />
mode of operation of the cortical and limbic centers of the brain, which in
<br />
higher mammals gives rise to consciousness and in humans to
<br />
self-consciousness. This will lead us to a possible answer to the second
<br />
question of why there is music.
<br />
<p>In our discussion I will argue (see background paper posted in FIS) that
<br />
music, as we know it, could not exist: (i) without a sensory system capable
<br />
of sophisticated processing operations working on complex temporal signals
<br />
and fast time-scales, such as in the mammal acoustical system; (ii) without
<br />
this sensory system playing the central role for the conveyance of
<br />
language-like information (i.e., highly compressed information encoding
<br />
complex sensory and mental images and their relationships); (iii) without a
<br />
brain-like central processor of information with motivational control of its
<br />
cognitive functions, so that non-inheritable components of language can be
<br />
acquired efficiently during the early lifetime of the organism; and (iv)
<br />
without a control mechanism working in the mode of dispensation of
<br />
reward/punishment-like feelings if a cognitive and behavioral action taken
<br />
is deemed favorable/detrimental according to inherited evolutionary experience. 
<br />
<p>Finally, of the three main theories of the evolutionary origin of music,
<br />
namely pre-human, pre-language, or co-evolving with human speech and
<br />
language, I will adopt the latter and claim that a similar development in
<br />
any civilization that developed and evolved based on carbon-chemistry would
<br />
not only be possible but might even be likely. I will also speculate on the
<br />
possibility of musics based on carriers other than acoustic waves, e.g.,
<br />
&quot;optical music&quot; with electromagnetic waves, and show that it would not be
<br />
possible to have the variety of fundamental attributes so essential for our
<br />
own musical cultures. 
<br />
<p>A detailed paper on these topics (Biological conditions for the emergence of
<br />
musical arts in a civilization of intelligent beings) is posted at
<br />
<a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/resources/papers.html">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/resources/papers.html</a>).
