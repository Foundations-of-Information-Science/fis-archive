Replying to Igor --
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Igor:  If I recall well, Schr&#x2013;dinger wrote that &quot;life thrives on low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entropy&quot;. In the absence of energy gradients there is no life. On the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hand, energy gradients by themselves may not necessarily create life to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;degrade them. This argument can be seen in the Lee Smolin's book &quot;Life of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Cosmos&quot;, where he points at the astonishing number of improbable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parameter values present in the elementary particles and in the atomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure, which, if were slightly different would not allow the formation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of basic, &quot;heavy&quot; elements the life is made of (carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc.). As we happen to live in the Universe where parameters are set right,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so that life is in principle possible, we may expect life to evolve in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;direction of dissipating extant energy gradients (both in terms of faster
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and more trough dissipation). If our Universe is definitely heading towards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the heat death, than life may appear as an auxiliary force in the overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process - as Stan wrote: &quot;Autocatalysis, and any building-up tendency, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply parasitic upon this necessary dissipation.&quot; However, even if we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pretty sure today that the Universe is accelerating we are not that much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure about the final outcome (i.e. the heat death or the Great Crunch),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because of the dark energy and matter effects, which we just stumbled upon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recently. Therefore, it is possible that there may be no Second Law
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;ultimate finality&quot; in the processes at the level of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we were to live in a different Universe, e.g. consisting of helium only,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if I recall correctly, there would be no stars, no galaxies and, therefore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no energy gradients to dissipate. In such a Universe the Second Law may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no relevance at all. It is also possible that the Big Bang would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produced an Universe with energy gradients but no possibility for life to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolve. Providing that this universe is accelerating/expanding, these energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gradients would, eventually, disappear according to the Second Law.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would be the perspective from the level of the total, closed system, -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe. If we look at things from the perspective of the semiclosed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sub-sub-sub system {galaxy, (solar system,  (Earth))}, than I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely with Bob and his argument about fossil fuels, which, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle, may exist without ever being dissipated until the Sun burns out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the whole solar system. The basic argument in favor of his statement is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human species was also an improbable event in the evolution of life, so the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance that there will no species able to dissipate energy bound in fossil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fuels was extremely high.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: The view expressed here is one that sees a system, if I may say
<br />
so, without systematicity.  By this I mean that the various parameters are
<br />
considered independent, so that each may be varied independendently of the
<br />
others, giving permutational possibilities of different universes.  My view
<br />
tends to be more systematic, even organicist -- or, indeed, holistic.  It
<br />
is not at all clear that imagining such permutations reflects other than
<br />
the traditional mechanicist perspective.  In any case, I speak of the one
<br />
world as it seems to be.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that Bob's and my views are mostly a matter of different
<br />
emphasis and choices made, in that neither of us can point out where the
<br />
other is in actual error.

<p>Replying to JohnH, who said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If all the world's entropy enthusiasts are laid end to end they may not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reach finality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is all human thought a slave to the Second Law? C'est la question. I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agnostic about that.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Of course, not much of human thought is ABOUT the Second Law, but
<br />
in a way it is indeed &quot;a slave to&quot; it.  The brain has the greatest energy
<br />
flow density of all tissues.  And the fact is, it never rests (even
<br />
asleep), entrained by one quest after another (or several simultaneously).
<br />
It takes great affort to quiet the brain, as in meditation.  It takes great
<br />
effort to sit still and not fidget (as we continually do).  I am not sure
<br />
if these 'efforts' are energy demanding, but they are extremely difficult
<br />
to maintain.  Meditation requires a kind of hypnotic inner repetition of a
<br />
mantra, which, I would be willing to entertain, is more energy demanding
<br />
than is the open 'stream of consciousness'.  So, we would have {entropy
<br />
production {neuronal activity {thinking}}}.

<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When Stan mentions me (see below from his last message) he is referring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a clonic Pedro, as I have never written such paragraphs. Presumably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is an e-glib, I assume.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I am sorry to make this error!  In any case, the point I make in
<br />
my last posting about the distinction between the two kinds of hierarchies
<br />
is, I think, of some importance, as hierarchy is coming to be more
<br />
important model in complexity discourse.  Perhaps I was misled by, as in
<br />
this current posting, Pedro's use of the term 'levels'.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro: Apart from the entropy discussion, important themes have just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;surfaced: interdisciplinary metaphors, structure of 'levels', and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Batesonian (plus Bertalanffy's &amp; Wiener's) legacy of the golden 60's.
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This term 'level' is central to hierarchy theory, as hierarchies
<br />
are composed of levels. Whenever I see 'levels', I think 'hierarchy'.  The
<br />
scale hierarchy has SCALAR LEVELS, differing dynamically/behaviorally by
<br />
rates of order of magnitude, as in [macroscopic dynamics [molecular
<br />
dynamics]], while the specification hierarchy has INTEGRATIVE LEVELS, as in
<br />
{molecular dynamics {cellular dynamics}}.

<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;SOC has been used as a metaphor or a model of biological and socioeconomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dynamics. After tinkering with it for the past few years, I am akin to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that SOC might be a good model for ecosystems and evolution but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so for socioeconomic systems. The main argument (details are available in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paper, if someone wishes, I can e-mail it) is that human systems are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dominated by institutional design, which constraints self-organizing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes, (e.g. economic activities), in a non-trivial way (the market
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself is an institution). The nature of institutional design is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contradiction with the self-organizing principle which is at the root of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;critical behavior.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I am wondering if institutional design is really conceptually
<br />
different in its effect from boundary conditions imposed on SOC by physical
<br />
surroundings.  No natural phenomenon -- say a tornado -- is unaffected by
<br />
its environment, and in descriptive equations we must add the values of
<br />
constants to represent these effects.  Why is institutional design not just
<br />
part of the 'enviroment' of economic activity, contributing somewhere to
<br />
the values of constants in its descriptive equations?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, the formation and behavior of autocatalytic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;networks, which is endogenous, does not fit well with formal characteristics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of SOC, which refers to &quot;externally driven&quot; systems.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS:  Are not most material phenomena combinations of both of these?
<br />
Certainly a tornado is.  In this case the tornado is actually only a part
<br />
of a larger phenomenon -- a rotating supercell -- which self-organizes,
<br />
making it look like its tornado part is externaly driven.  Of course,
<br />
self-organizing autocatalytic systems also must be afforded by
<br />
environmental configurations before they can occur.  This applies as well
<br />
to organisms as to simpler forms -- and this contextualization by
<br />
environment is a key principle of scalar hierarchy theory.
