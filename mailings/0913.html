Dear Jerry
<br />
<p>I was thinking that it is not possible to have a theory of information, cognition and communication without a concept of meaning. Meaning as we see it today is related to life, mind and consciousness, but usually not in the chemical and physical realm. It seems still to be the general aim to explain biology chemically and chemistry physically. But I agree with you that already in chemistry we see formal causation. Chemistry as physiology in the nervous system is necessary for first person experiences - they are not the experiences. If mind did not &quot;fall from the sky&quot; then it has developed through evolution - still it is completely outside the explanatory powers of physics, chemistry and biology as they are understood in mainstream science. A concept of information build on the same foundation - like the Wienerian - will in my opinion not solve any problems, but obscure the foundation problems we have in the sciences. A problem that is most obvious in that we have no idea wha!
<br />
t so ever of how mental decision based on free will can have any causal influence on our physiology.
<br />
<p>Thus I agree with Edwina in  that we need a new foundation. We cannot just add information theory on top of the old one. I am reluctant to go as far as she does and I am trying to formulate the foundation in a slightly different way. We seem to interpret Peirce a bit different. But never the less it is the same quest and a fruitful disagreement.
<br />
<p>Somehow meaning and mind must be part of foundational reality (Peirce's firstness) and it is not so far.The quantum vacuum fields is our closest candidate to a foundational reality and they are described physicalistic. Still a lot of researcher are trying to build theories of consciousness. on quantum field theory. I think they will fail - and we will fail - if we do not address the ontological and epistemological foundation. We have to  That is why I am working with that and I think that a Peircian based biosemiotics combined with at systems and cybernetic view is a good candidate. I choose to see information then as we use the concept in the sciences to be proto semiotic and tied to the level of formal causation. What is called information processes on the level of cells I acknowledge as sign processes or sign games. Language games we only see in humans and it is connected to consciousness.
<br />
<p>Thus mind will be a part of the natural sciences but on a new philosophical foundation. The &quot;physical universe&quot; can only be considered closed if it encompasses mind and its evolution.

<p>Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This email responds to several recent posts (Christophe, Rafael, 
<br />
Soren and Pedro.)
<br />
My last post is appended below for reference.
<br />
<p>Theory of Information:
<br />
<p>Given the stated objectives, what constitutes a set of objective 
<br />
criteria that would specify a theory of information?  What would be 
<br />
the role of abstraction in such a specifying of an informational 
<br />
species?
<br />
<p>I suspect that it is possible to specify a theory of communication 
<br />
between two systems - such a specification of communication would a 
<br />
priori place information   in the same role that Shannon places 
<br />
information - that is, as a transmitting agent.  Theories of 
<br />
molecular biological communication are well accepted in physiology 
<br />
and medicine, eg, the second messenger hypothesis.  The biological 
<br />
specification of communication includes the specification of the 
<br />
communicating species.
<br />
<p>Christophe writes on Jan. 17,
<br />
<p>&quot;To cover the diversity, we could think about a general approach
<br />
on pragmatic aspect of information. It would be about
<br />
considering the evolution of the universe with corresponding
<br />
increases in complexity, and begin the analysis of  &quot;what is (that)
<br />
information for&quot; at the lowest level possible. And then try to
<br />
analyse the possible evolution of the &quot;rational for information&quot;,
<br />
with addition of new contributors as needed. &quot;
<br />
<p>In the main, I concur with Christophe's suggestion as a prudent 
<br />
approach to theory building.  Such an approach could be  grounded in 
<br />
the philosophy Bergson, De Chardin, and a wide range of various 
<br />
system's theorists.  ( This approach strongly influences my own 
<br />
approaches to this topic.)
<br />
<p>One difficulty in this approach is translating among the different 
<br />
technical languages of the various disciplines.  In order to 
<br />
construct a theory applicable to multiple disciplines, one must a 
<br />
priori find words and symbols that move freely among disciplines. 
<br />
Philosophically, this task is analogous to moving freely between 
<br />
external 'realities&quot; and internal belief structures and individual 
<br />
eisegesis.
<br />
<p>Rafeal puzzles me when he writes:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But finally, philosophically speaking,
<br />
the clarification of the *how* does not explain
<br />
*time* itself.&quot;
<br />
<p>At issue in this sentence, it seems to me, is the reification of an 
<br />
abstraction.
<br />
<p>In what *sense* should an abstract concept be gratuitously endowed 
<br />
with a self, with *encasement*, with *embodiment*?
<br />
<p>Clearly, molecular biological communication comes encased in symbols 
<br />
that are meaningfully encased in the *logic* of the natural sciences 
<br />
- relational symbols that create the essential relations for natural 
<br />
systems and intervolutionary developments.
<br />
<p>To what extent can one *substitute* the *languaging* of *time* for 
<br />
the nature of matter?
<br />
<p>Soren's thoughtful post brings several items to the current table:
<br />
<p>&quot;I think the underlying philosophical questions are:
<br />
<p>1. Can we fit a theory of meaning into the natural sciences as we 
<br />
know them? Or will we have to consider the human concept of meaning 
<br />
as a self-hallucination?
<br />
2. Do we consider the physical universe to be closed, meaning that 
<br />
physical causality is all there is in nature. We accept in humans 
<br />
mental to mental causality, but the mental cannot have any causal 
<br />
effect on the physical.
<br />
this lead to the third basic question:
<br />
3. What is the relation between the physical and the 
<br />
mental-intensional since they either seems to exist in world apart 
<br />
(Descartes). Is it functionalistic information (based on Shannon or 
<br />
Wiener's information theories) that is the link?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the mental and the physical is be aspects of the same one reality 
<br />
(Spinosa) seen from inside and outside. But then somehow there is 
<br />
mind in nature and we have to leave both a deterministic and a purely 
<br />
indeterministic view of the physical world.&quot;
<br />
<p>Soren's first question is understandable in a narrow framework, at 
<br />
least to me.  Does an unstated presupposition lay beneath the 
<br />
surface?  Should a philosophy of meaning search for a universal 
<br />
explication of meaning in the sense that physical theories assert 
<br />
universality?   Or, as is common in the natural sciences, should the 
<br />
meaning of a signal depend on the pre-existing relations between two 
<br />
systems?  Under what circumstances would a natural or technical 
<br />
language support a universal theory of meaning?  Would a theory of 
<br />
communication that supports normal human behavior  suffice as a 
<br />
theory of communication?  (In politics, they sometimes refer to the 
<br />
fear, &quot;Do not let the perfect spoil the good&quot;.)o the specification of the 
<br />
commun
<br />
<p>Soren's second question is phrased once again in physical terms and 
<br />
effectively excludes chemistry and biology.  I spent several years 
<br />
researching the development of drugs (chemical agents) for therapy 
<br />
for epilepsy.  Mathematically, chemical causality is fundamentally 
<br />
different from physical causality. It is an observable fact that 
<br />
human mentation is generated by biochemical processes within the 
<br />
central nervous system.  No such relation with physical abstractions 
<br />
is known despite the numerous hypotheses.  The path dependency from 
<br />
physical logic to mental logic must pass through chemical logic, or 
<br />
are other alternatives available?
<br />
<p>Soren's third question is once again focused on physical philosophies 
<br />
that have not been extended to living systems.  By setting such 
<br />
questions in terms of the extremes of abstraction, does one 
<br />
unintentionally exclude the evolutionary or intervolutionary facts 
<br />
that generate a stepwise historical progression from the simple to 
<br />
the perplex?
<br />
<p>Soren's view that:
<br />
<p>&quot;That will also give a slightly different view on mathematics. It is 
<br />
not existing in nature by itself as such, but it appears as a 
<br />
semiotic process in evolution in the emergence of mind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
is close to my own. Indeed, is this not close to what is meant by abstraction?
<br />
Is this not what is meant by separating the community's  exegesis of 
<br />
external world of reality from individual eisegesis of an internal 
<br />
world?
<br />
I hasten to add that Soren's view  perplexifies the nature of 
<br />
information and indeed of evolution itself.  Why?  Because now 
<br />
intervolutionary theory must explicate the generating sources of 
<br />
mathematics itself (and other abstractions, such as space and time) 
<br />
in addition to  biological intervolution.
<br />
<p>Pedro's contribution was informative as usual.  I would only caution 
<br />
that the metaphor of weaving,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;The info 'thread' needs to be woven into finer strands in order to 
<br />
provide those clear responses --and in spite of this conference 
<br />
advancements we keep the info thread largely into the state of 
<br />
'bundle' yet.&quot;
<br />
<p>was explored vigorously.  It is very picturesque and at times the 
<br />
metaphor is compelling.  But, the practical utility of introducing 
<br />
the weaving metaphor has not been demonstrated.  Also, is it possible 
<br />
that we already have  the finest-grained structure for information in 
<br />
the Shannon abstraction and what we seek are coarser grained theories?
<br />
<p>In closing, I am looking forward to a busy semester and do not 
<br />
anticipate the luxury of responding to posts frequently.  I express 
<br />
my gratitude to Pedro and all the session chairs for making the FIS 
<br />
conference a stimulating event.
<br />
<p>Cheers to all

<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Colleagues:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This email responds to recent discussions and extend my earlier 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remarks.  The original email is included below for your reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Were the questions I poised not relevant to a theory of information? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If they are not relevant, then what would be relevant?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One possibility is that the strength of beliefs in entropy as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;source of material information is so strong that it blocks thinking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about generic philosophical issues related to science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this is the case, can someone &quot;make the case&quot; for entropy - that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is, systematically list the basic reasons that support the concept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that entropy can be generalized to cover all possible forms of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication / information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The absence of responses to the questions concerning abstraction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suggest that the role of abstraction in science, philosophy and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematics should be publicly examined by this group.  The nature 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of abstraction is fundamental to trans disciplinary discussions. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does anyone have a better suggestion on how to open the possibility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of moving from eisegesis to exegesis and theory construction?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rafael's question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, if I may add an underlying question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how do *information* and (Platonic) *idea* relate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to each other? Are we having a *re-vision* of Platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought? if so, where are the differences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illustrates one of the problems with language.  In so far as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;word &quot;information&quot; is derived from the root &quot;form&quot;, one can not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;totally ignore the potential role of Platonic thought.  But, will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this aid us in theory building?  Indeed, if we can not move from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;eisegesis to exegesis, can philosophy play a role?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Clearly, philosophers are often skilled at painting a simplifying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view of nature.  But, how are these talents to be directed toward 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exegesis?  How are these talents related to generating an intricate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view of the nature of communication / information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One area that philosophers could potentially contribute to is coding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory.  What is the common meaning of encoding and decoding and how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are systems distinguished by their encoding capacities?  What are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the sources of motion that generate encodings?  What are the path 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dependencies that support encoding operations?  Explication is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needed, not merely explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The narratives of process philosophers (such as Whitehead) are often 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illuminating when applied to biological dynamics.  Could process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy become a base for theory building covering the component 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of transmission of information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Russell's intricate writings on correspondence also provides an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opportunity for philosophical exegesis. The matching of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corresponding relations from mathematics to science is powerful.  In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what sense is the non-symmetry of encoding and decoding of human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communication a form of correspondence?  Or, under what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;circumstances can human communication be viewed as a symmetrical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;operation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tarski's logic is obviously relevant to any many layered (eg, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex) associative relation.  Should Tarski's logic be invoked to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relate various forms of communication?  If not, why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Finally, a critical area exists which I have been reluctant to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comment upon.  That is, to what extent can we elide our philosophy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mathematics?  The suggestion that we are faced with a choice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among set theory, group theory or category theory could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rephrased.  Each mathematical theory is a choice among a collection 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of rules that describe the species - the specification of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory.  In a certain sense, one can talk of &quot;the category of sets&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or &quot;the category of groups&quot; or even the &quot;category of categories&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The narrative power of mathematical languages include a tight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;network of relations which promote such usages. The mathematics will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take care of itself once one has a crisp description of the logic of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the theory, will it not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Cheers to All
