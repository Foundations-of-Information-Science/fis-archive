<p>Jerry makes a good point. Oster and Wilson, in a paper reprinted in Sober's 
<br />
collection on evolution, argue that even in cases in which optimality is 
<br />
relatively well defined the evidence for it is poor. Extremal principles 
<br />
play a central role in Netwonina physics as it developed in the Laplacean 
<br />
and Hamiltonian formulations. The latter applies only to conservative 
<br />
systems, which biological organisms most certainly are not, not even 
<br />
approximately, however some extremal principles like the principle of 
<br />
action (PLA) apply to all contemporary dynamics including Quantum 
<br />
Mechanics. No exceptions are known to PLA, and they are analytically 
<br />
impossible on current theory (exceptions due to quantum fluctuations have 
<br />
no dynamical significance).
<br />
<p>There are a coupe of extremal principles that have been proposed in 
<br />
thermodynamics that could apply to biological systems. One is a 
<br />
generalization of PLA that Prigogine proposed for near to equilibrium 
<br />
systems (it also applies to network systems in steady state, or near to 
<br />
steady state, and in general when the Onsager reciprocity relations hold -- 
<br />
this is basically a reciprocity between forces and flows). It is of 
<br />
interest to this group, since when it holds, local information plays no 
<br />
role that is independent of overall system constraints (i.e., it is 
<br />
reducible to dynamical constraints). This principle is that of minimal 
<br />
entropy production (MinEntPro). It is a local principle, and its integral 
<br />
is possible in all the cases in which Onsager Reciprocity holds, giving a 
<br />
global principle. Interstingly, the cases in which Onsager reciprocity 
<br />
holds are all approximately Hamiltonian, and behave like conservative 
<br />
systems. This should make us suspicious of any extension to organisms, and 
<br />
indeed Prigogine pointed out that it does not hold for far from equilibrium 
<br />
systems. He proposed that entropy production is minimized in the 
<br />
generalized direction of any applied generalized force. There are no known 
<br />
exceptions to this hypothesis, but it is hard to test. Nonetheless, it 
<br />
seems to me that it follows naturally from PLA -- a system will respond to 
<br />
a force by trying to minimize its direct effects -- this gloss is too 
<br />
clumsy to use analytically, however. In any case, given the failure of 
<br />
reciprocity of forces and flows in these cases, details of local structure 
<br />
matter a lot, and small deviations can lead to large scale system 
<br />
reorganization -- these two conditions are characteristic of situations 
<br />
in  which small amounts of energy can control large amounts, raising the 
<br />
possible relevance of control theory, and therefore information theory. 
<br />
Note that the systems involved are extremely non-Hamiltonian (at least on 
<br />
the surface -- current Quantum Mechanics is all Hamiltonian -- one might 
<br />
reflect on how non-Hamiltonian behavior can arise from a Hamiltonian 
<br />
mechanics, but I will not do this here). There is more on these ideas an 
<br />
their implications in my four paper series on autonomy for CASYS, available 
<br />
on my web page at the KLI, so I will drop the issue here.
<br />
<p>A second way that extremal principles have been suggested for living 
<br />
systems is the principle of entropy production maximization (MaxEntPro). 
<br />
This is a global principle proposed first, I think, by Rod Swenson, though 
<br />
one can read a version of it back into Jaynes. It seems to violate PLA very 
<br />
seriously. Anyway, Schneider and Kay have proposed an extension to 
<br />
thermodynamics according to which systems use every means at their 
<br />
disposal, including reorganization, to approach as closely as possible to 
<br />
equilibrium. They claim to have evidence for this from ecology, though I 
<br />
find the evidence ambiguous. The important point for this group is that, 
<br />
like MinEntPro, it allows information to be reduced out. Schneider is quite 
<br />
clear about this implication in his recent writing. MaxEntPro systems are 
<br />
obviously highly non-Hamiltonian (highly non-conservative), but there is a 
<br />
sense in which they are very mechanical like, because of their extremal 
<br />
behavior. One system that approaches MaxEntPro is the Earth's atmosphere, 
<br />
and fluid vortices in general. it is precisely their lack of stable 
<br />
structure that allows this. (Recent empirical work suggests that the 
<br />
Kolmogorov hypothesis of self-similarity of vortices at all scales except 
<br />
the larges is actually false at small scales, so perhaps event the 
<br />
atmosphere case does not really fit the MaxEntPro model.)
<br />
<p>Anyway, these are two approaches that might support optimality arguments in 
<br />
a general way. I think that both are flawed, but it is interesting that 
<br />
both reduce out (eliminative reduction) the need for information. I think 
<br />
this is a general property of extremal approaches in general, and of 
<br />
optimality in particular.
<br />
<p>There is another approach to organisms that supports optimality. This it 
<br />
the autopoietic approach. On this approach the organization of the organism 
<br />
is functionally independent (operationally closed), and works pretty much 
<br />
like a Hamiltonian system. Maturana and Varella refer to autopoietic 
<br />
mechanisms. Optimality can be defined with respect to autopoietic 
<br />
operation. Rosen also makes operational closure a central part of living 
<br />
systems, but explicitly denies mechanism. A close look at his work, though, 
<br />
shows that he really denies only one side of traditional mechanism, and has 
<br />
little to say about the other side, which is more important for a system 
<br />
being treatable by Hamiltonian methods (Don Mickulecky, a noted Rsoenite, 
<br />
specifically champions network methods, for example, despite the original 
<br />
authors on network approaches explicitly excluding their applicability to 
<br />
general biological systems on the grounds of far from equilibrium 
<br />
conditions). Personally, I don't find Rosen's writings on these issues very 
<br />
clear, partly because of his idiosyncratic view of mechanism. I am not sure 
<br />
he is wrong, but I am not sure he is right either. In any case, the 
<br />
autopoiesis approach does support optimality approaches, and it does allow 
<br />
the elimination of information (Maturana and Varela, for example, carefully 
<br />
point out that information accounts are external to the autopoietic system, 
<br />
and that there is no need for information accounts internally -- they are 
<br />
quite correct in this, but I think that this shows that autopoiesis, 
<br />
strictly understood in their terms, cannot be the basis of the organization 
<br />
of organisms -- but that is just my opinion -- for the arguments for this 
<br />
opinion, see the papers on autonomy and self-organization on my web site.)
<br />
<p>So, in answer to Jerry, there are at least three approaches in the current 
<br />
literature that are not reductionist in the traditional microreductionist 
<br />
(Newtonian atomism is an example) sense that nonetheless have the following 
<br />
properties: 1) they do not require information accounts (eliminativist with 
<br />
respect to information), 2) they support extremal principles,and hence some 
<br />
version of optimality, 3) they have elements of mechanism, and 4) they are 
<br />
basically extensions of Hamiltonian models.
<br />
<p>I think they are all seriously flawed, but I can't go into the details of 
<br />
my reasons now.
