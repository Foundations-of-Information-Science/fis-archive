<p>
I guess the debate between the 'lowest limit' of the site for
<br />
information processing will continue to be debated and I don't see the
<br />
point of coming to a single conclusion, for I feel that it would be
<br />
not only impossible but counterproductive. Science is about
<br />
exploration not about consensus. So-  I disagree with a 'lowest limit'
<br />
that considers that information processes only take place within the
<br />
living organism. James Barham writes about the 'reification of
<br />
information' and I don't know what he means by this. A reificiation of
<br />
anything, to me, is the transformation of a dynamic process into a
<br />
closed symbolic process and I don't see how this relates to my theme
<br />
that information processing takes place within physical and chemical
<br />
processes as well as within biological and socioconceptual processes.
<br />
<p>I agree that we operate within both internal and external realities.
<br />
However, I do not agree that information exists 'as itself' . Never.
<br />
That's Platonic and I'm a die-hard Aristotelian. Information is
<br />
matter-in-relation-to-other matter. Such relations, of both habitual
<br />
and immediate type, can take place within all interactional processes
<br />
in this cosmos - the physical-chemical, the biological and the
<br />
socioconceptual. I therefore don't agree that information exists
<br />
&quot;only in conjunction with living matter&quot; (quote from Barham). I think
<br />
that the nature of 'what is information' and 'what is knowledge' has
<br />
to be very clearly defined by each researcher - and we probably will
<br />
not come to a unanimous conclusion. To me, information is, again, the
<br />
result of relations. Matter/energy...in relation to other
<br />
matter/energy is not longer non-informed but IS informed, it is
<br />
information, it operates, in order to be in these relations, as
<br />
'information'. A mass of energy, when it is organized such that it has
<br />
a particular relation of its energy/mass...with one proton and one
<br />
electron, IS informed mass. Its informed nature permits it to enter
<br />
into specific relations with other informed mass - ie - more hydrogen
<br />
atoms...to become a molecule..or whatever. So, these relations, which
<br />
operate according to rules, are most certainly, in my view, actions of
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>The biological realm operates within a more complex process of
<br />
relations - but again, the axioms are the same - ie, with the
<br />
necessity for these relations to operate according to codal rules, and
<br />
the result of the relations meaning a more complex formation of
<br />
mass/energy.
<br />
<p>I don't agree that in the abiotic or 'inanimate universe', that
<br />
'information is always relative to us as knowers&quot; (Barham quote).
<br />
Information is part of the abiotic formation of mass. As I said, an
<br />
atom has to organize itself in a particular relation of mass/energy,
<br />
in order to be that atom, to be that molecule. That's an informed
<br />
relation...and most certainly the molecule doesn't rely on us, as
<br />
agents-who-come-along- and -describe, in order to exist as that
<br />
organized/informed molecule.  Our description is irrelevant to its
<br />
reality.
