<p>
Dear Stan,
<br />
<p>1. Thanks for considering &quot;order&quot; and &quot;constraint&quot;.
<br />
<p>Let us forget symmetry first: &quot;more constraints, more order&quot; should be 
<br />
accepted.
<br />
<p>To be complete, a system has higher &quot;order&quot; may imply
<br />
the following: if there are more constraints, there will be less 
<br />
freedom, less dynamic,
<br />
more static and more confined; (or less symmetric), more information, 
<br />
less entropy
<br />
and higher &quot;order&quot;. (I guess this is what you meant by &quot;constraints&quot; in 
<br />
another
<br />
thread where you said &quot;further constraints are bearing upon some 
<br />
systems, hemming them
<br />
in with a greater burden of information&quot;. Constraints made a structure 
<br />
with a higher
<br />
amount of information.
<br />
<p>Keep this in mind, let us examine two examples: 1. the constraint is the 
<br />
wall
<br />
separating two ideal gases (oxygen and nitrogen). 2. the constraint is the
<br />
wall separating oil and water.
<br />
<p>Excuse me but let me try to sell my humble theory called &quot;similarity 
<br />
principle&quot; here.
<br />
It says that entropy increases with the increase in the property 
<br />
similarity of the
<br />
components (see my S-Z plot at <a href="../../www.mdpi.org/lin/default.htm">http://www.mdpi.org/lin/</a>). This is the 
<br />
basis of
<br />
my revision of the information theory where information and entropy are 
<br />
defined
<br />
and their general properties are expressed as three laws similar to 
<br />
thermodynamic
<br />
laws. For example, Energy (E) divided by (kT, k is Boltzmann constant, T 
<br />
is temperature) will
<br />
give a dimensionless measure called L. The first law of thermodynamics 
<br />
E=kTS+F
<br />
(F is free energy) will become L=S+I (This is my unpublished work.
<br />
Thermodynamics is a special case of information theory criteria for 
<br />
conservation
<br />
of certain structural feature). During a process, the increased similarity
<br />
among two parts of a system will increase entropy and reduce information.
<br />
<p>1.1. The two parts of ideal gases may have other difference in (P), 
<br />
temperature (T) or chemical
<br />
concentration or in density, and will be a spontaneous process if the 
<br />
constraint
<br />
is removed. At the end, the two ideal gas parts become the same (in P, T and
<br />
density, etc.): the system seeks such sameness, driving by information loss
<br />
(in thermodynamics, potential or free energy reduction) or entropy increase.
<br />
<p>They (oxygen and nitrogen) would like to aggregate because they are both
<br />
the same kind of substances: both are ideal gas. However, a constraint 
<br />
can maintain
<br />
other differences (P, T, etc., or one side has concentration of oxygen 
<br />
100% and nitrogen 0%,
<br />
the other side has oxygen 0% and nitrogen 100%) and order.
<br />
<p>1.2. Unlike ideal gases (nitrogen and oxygen) which are intrinsically 
<br />
the same
<br />
to a device measuring P and T (or kinetic energy of the molecule),
<br />
oil and water are regarded as intrinsically different. A constraint is 
<br />
not required
<br />
to separate the two phases. Therefore, the arrangement of oil and water
<br />
droplets may be used to record data in a solid device.
<br />
<p>Truly different substances spontaneously separate because the same 
<br />
substances
<br />
O and O would like to aggregate and W and W would like to aggregate. As 
<br />
a result,
<br />
O and W are separated. This follows my similarity principle pretty well.
<br />
Now the constraints are needed to stop O and O droplets from aggregation
<br />
to maintain the information.
<br />
<p>The property similarity can be controlled by certain operation (I 
<br />
remember a colleague
<br />
just discussed the word &quot;operation&quot; in another thread): pressure (P) and 
<br />
temperature (T) control.
<br />
At certain very high P and very high T, water (W) and oil (O) will 
<br />
spontaneously
<br />
mix to form a homogeneous fluid phase. Then, only constraint (a wall) can
<br />
separate them and can maintain the &quot;order&quot; or the orderly structure and 
<br />
maintain
<br />
the final 2 bits of information.
<br />
<p>The gravity of the Earth will further reduce the similarity between 
<br />
water and oil and
<br />
will facilitate their separation at low temperature. I got my Ph.D. from an
<br />
organic chemistry laboratory and I was a postdoc doing organic
<br />
chemical synthesis (preparing all kinds of &quot;oil&quot;, the so-called organic 
<br />
compounds)
<br />
in a medicinal chemistry labor where the W/O separation in a separation 
<br />
funnel,
<br />
the so-called hydrophobic effect, was used daily. I also add salts to 
<br />
the water
<br />
phase to make the aqueous phase more aqueous and more different from
<br />
the oil phase. I find everything I observed fits into my &quot;similarity 
<br />
principle&quot;.
<br />
<p>2. Szilard's Engine and Information
<br />
<p>Mixing of different ideal gases (oxygen and nitrogen) originally 
<br />
separated in
<br />
two parts of a rigid container at the same and unchanged T and P cannot 
<br />
generate
<br />
any mechanical work. This is for sure. If Szilard's Engine works, the
<br />
2nd law will be no law at all. Of course Szilard's discussion
<br />
contributed tremendously to information theory.
<br />
<p>However, if the constraints separating an ideal gas into
<br />
two or more parts in flexible containers (gas bubbles in a liquid phase),
<br />
the aggregation to form a bulky gaseous phase can generate mechanical work
<br />
if there is a suitable machine. This is similar to oil droplets 
<br />
aggregation in water
<br />
to form a bulky oil phase. Oil/water separation at a lower temperature can
<br />
create mechanical work. This might be the very mechanism of
<br />
our muscle contraction and relaxation cycle to do animal work. The machine
<br />
(an Engine) is an animal muscle cell. Gas bubbles in water and oil 
<br />
droplets in water have the same
<br />
kind of constraints and obeys the same kind of &quot;order&quot;, in my humble 
<br />
opinion.
<br />
<p>(Ideal gas molecules by definition do not have molecular interaction.
<br />
Here we ignore molecular interaction among molecules in a bulk condensed 
<br />
phase
<br />
and on the interfaces. Hydrophobic effect has been explained mainly by
<br />
surface free energy consideration.)
<br />
<p>3. Information (I) is the measure of the compressed data
<br />
<p>Finally, as a chemist, my interest is to use information (I) to 
<br />
characterize the
<br />
structures and their stability of a molecular system. I am sure different
<br />
structures with different constraints (either macroscopic or microscopic
<br />
constraints) represent different amount of information. The difference
<br />
and the information change can be experimentally (operationally)
<br />
measured by monitoring certain chemical and physical properties before 
<br />
and after
<br />
the constraints are removed. To make any progress on this direction,
<br />
it is necessary to define information (I). My definition of information (I)
<br />
is the measure of the compressed data. If the amount of date cannot be 
<br />
compressed
<br />
any further, that amount is called information (I). Then, the maximum 
<br />
data is L.
<br />
Entropy S=L-I. Lewis, Brillouin and many other people accepted &quot;information
<br />
loss = entropy increase&quot; relation. Shannon's consideration is a dynamic
<br />
channel of communication. Shannon basically call entropy something like 
<br />
&quot;entropy
<br />
of information &quot; (or entropy of signal, entropy of a set of symbol, 
<br />
etc.). Loet's
<br />
comments are correct for other area of studies where we may tolerate if the
<br />
difference between entropy and information concepts are not told.
<br />
However, because we are doing science, it is always very important (at least
<br />
harmless) to define clearly the obvious. If information (I) is defined, 
<br />
we can work.
<br />
My interest as a chemist is a static structure (not a communication channel)
<br />
and there is always an information amount. Even for an ideal gas where
<br />
molecules are always in kinetic motion, if it is confined in a chamber,
<br />
the chamber (a constraint) defines a static structure for the ideal gas.
<br />
Electrons and nuclei are confined in a static structure called molecule.
<br />
Therefore we can consider individual molecule and its stability by
<br />
information theory.
<br />
<p>Excuse me also for my repeated presentation because I think I expressed
<br />
these ideas many times before, at least when we were discussing 
<br />
molecular recognition.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to which I replied: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS:   I find this interesting in regard to the understanding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical entropy as disorder. This interpretation has been disputed because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of examples like mixtures of oil and water, which seem to spontaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;separate, making a more orderly result than was present in the mixed state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But Shu-Kun's posting here suggests why this understanding is specious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is neglected in this view is that energy-utilizing work had to be done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to mix the oil and water to begin with, in a thermal process. This process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set up a curious kind of dispersed energy gradient, which then dissipated,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;producing the separation, and giving off heat again. That is to say, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unmixing of oil and water is a kind of work (not unlike the unwinding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many wound up rubber bands!), and, as such, would not be expected to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produce disorder. Put another way, the unmixing of oil and water is NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SPONTANEOUS, but is instead a massive amount of microscopic work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then Victoras said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       How would behave a mixture of oil and water if Earth's field of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;gravitation was absent - would it mix or separate ? Can this be described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;by a conditional sentence like the one below ?  if (gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;present){separation} else {mixing}  Then it seems like an algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;process where entropy produces opposite results given different initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conditions. Thousands, millions, mirriads of similar conditional branches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;take place every moment everywhere in the Universe. Thence everything can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be described/modelled as causal chains of events. That's how our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(natural) and artificial inteligence (rule based or case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(experience) based reasoning) work. Just interesting parralels...

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to which Shu-Kun replied:  They would separate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: So, Victoras sees the energy gradient being used to power the work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of separating oil and water as being gravitational energy, while Shu-Kun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implies that it is instead some kind of chemical gradient.  Either way my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point is not being disputed.  Therefore, even though the energy gradient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dissipation view of entropy production is historically prior, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empirically measurable, the increasing disorder view is not falsified by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this oil/water example in the way that some folks thought it was.
