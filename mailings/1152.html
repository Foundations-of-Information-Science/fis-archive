Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>The topic assigned by Pedro, &quot;Ecological Economics and Information&quot;, 
<br />
is extraordinarily challenging. The vast scope of these terms is 
<br />
nearly beyond comprehension.  In these brief remarks, I can only 
<br />
touch on a few qualitative concepts of central importance in my work. 
<br />
Quantitative concepts are addressed in Luis's writings which are 
<br />
posted in the accompanying post.   I am deeply grateful to Luis for 
<br />
his views and the assistance of Pedro.
<br />
<p>Let us start by noting that the root of both &quot;Ecological&quot; and of 
<br />
&quot;Economics&quot; is the derived from the Greek, oi, oikos (house, home). 
<br />
A simple implication of this common source of the two terms is that 
<br />
the pair of words, taken together, enjoy a mutual reflexivity.  At 
<br />
the conceptual level, the common root, &quot;eco&quot;, suggests that the 
<br />
concept of economics is implicit within the concept of ecology.  A 
<br />
rough translation of the reflexivity in a logical sense could be &quot;the 
<br />
study of the study of the laws of the home.&quot;
<br />
<p>The semantics of the third term &quot;information&quot; offer many possible 
<br />
interpretations. I choose  to draw from the direct source of the 
<br />
languaging of the term itself, the notion of information as bringing 
<br />
form into a system.  An example of this usage of the term information 
<br />
consists of supposing one has an open system and it acquires new 
<br />
forms.  The information acquired by the system introduces new 
<br />
relations within the system.  The acquired forms have a potential to 
<br />
introduce a dynamic within the informed system.  This usage is 
<br />
closely associated with a general conceptualization of the concept of 
<br />
communication.
<br />
<p>To summarize the preceding two paragraphs, one interpretation of the 
<br />
phrase, &quot;Ecological Economics and Information&quot;, is a reflection on 
<br />
the nature of the rules of the flows of a system.  What structures 
<br />
could provide a basis for such a meditation on the nature of 
<br />
transdisciplinary relationships?
<br />
<p>The concept of a system requires a distinction between the &quot;self&quot; of 
<br />
the system and the circumstances surrounding the system.  But, what 
<br />
is the self of a system?  We might answer this perplexing question by 
<br />
stating that we can imagine two incommensurate classes of systems. 
<br />
One class of systems being defined inside of a boundary.  The 
<br />
boundary separates the interior from the exterior.  An example of a 
<br />
boundary is our skin.  Our language is rich in terms describing 
<br />
boundaries.  Terms such as wall, container, bank, cup, bowl, room, 
<br />
building, and so forth imply a boundary of one type or another.   The 
<br />
concept of a boundary serves as an initial step in generating a 
<br />
concept of specificity of form.  Thus, in one class of the two 
<br />
classes of systems, we speak of boundaries as one source of form of 
<br />
the system.
<br />
<p>The concept of boundary is thus deeply entangled with the concept 
<br />
identity in such systems.
<br />
<p>Boundary-less systems form a second class of systems.  Obviously, the 
<br />
boundary-less  systems lack a boundary.  But, the absence of boundary 
<br />
does not mean the absence of an identity.  The relation of boundary 
<br />
to identity in the first class of systems can be replaced by a 
<br />
non-physical boundary.  The boundary becomes an abstraction in the 
<br />
mind of the student of the system.  The absence of  a crisp 
<br />
separation of the interior from the exterior in boundary-less systems 
<br />
does not mean the absence of form nor the absence of form of 
<br />
components of the system.  For example, we may speak of an ecosystem 
<br />
such as the &quot;Mississippi River Basin Ecosystem (Miribe)&quot;.  The 
<br />
dynamic flow of materials through the Miribe can be roughly estimated 
<br />
in terms of averages of annual cycles. For example, the cycling of 
<br />
chemicals (CO2, H2O, Carbon, N2, minerals, and so forth) recurs each 
<br />
year in greater or lesser amounts.   The flow of materials is 
<br />
creative in biological ecosystems.
<br />
<p>The components of boundary-less systems may possess boundaries.  The 
<br />
boundaries of components convey specific forms on the components of 
<br />
Miribe.  Thus, an analysis, a study of the study of Miribe  requires 
<br />
that we ask for a classification of the components of the system.
<br />
<p>In earlier work (Chandler, NYAS,vol. 879, 75-86, 1999, vol. 901, 
<br />
75-85, 2000)  a suitable classification of systems was developed. The 
<br />
proposed classification is organic.  That is, a degree of 
<br />
organization is used to distinguish among components.  The chemical 
<br />
basis of the classification provides a natural relation with 
<br />
biological systems without discarding the concept of distance.  The 
<br />
organic basis of the scale, grounded in the atomic numbers of the 
<br />
chemical elements, provides an intrinsic meter for counting and for 
<br />
accounting of relations in terms of semantic names of components.  It 
<br />
is a simple, direct scientific classification that separates 
<br />
components on the basis of the degree of organization rather than 
<br />
linear distance or arithmetic operations .
<br />
<p>The categories are:
<br />
<p>O° 1 subatomic particles
<br />
O° 2 chemical elements
<br />
O° 3 molecules
<br />
O° 4 biomacromolecules
<br />
O° 5 cells
<br />
O° 6 organs
<br />
O° 7 individuals
<br />
O° 8 populations
<br />
O° 9 ecosystems
<br />
O°10 planet
<br />
<p>The objective of this categorization is not to give a theory of 
<br />
everything.  Rather the objective is to provide a basis for 
<br />
reflection on the structure of scientific languages and the potential 
<br />
for relations among these scientific languages in nature. Other 
<br />
categorizations can add finer structures to the distinctions.   Each 
<br />
degree of organization provides a &quot;home&quot; for a collection of terms 
<br />
and scientific theories.  Frequently, individual terms may be used in 
<br />
multiple layers or stages or hierarchical levels or degrees of 
<br />
organization. The multiplicity of usages generates a polysema that 
<br />
strongly influences communications among different scientific 
<br />
subdisciplines. Usage of a term in multiple degrees of organization 
<br />
introduces uncertainty.
<br />
<p>The concept of communication varies with the degree of organization. 
<br />
At the levels of O°1, O°2, and O°3, communication occurs as a 
<br />
physical process of interaction.  At levels O°5, O°6, O°7, and O°8, 
<br />
the principle means of communication are by active acquisition. 
<br />
Components of levels O°5, O°6, O°7, and O°8, have acquired the 
<br />
capacity to generate information, to transmit information and to 
<br />
interpret information.  Commutative relations among information 
<br />
creation, information transmission and information re-arrangements 
<br />
are essential features of biological and social structures. At the 
<br />
level of ecosystems, information flows include possible permutations 
<br />
of information flows among the individual components of each degree 
<br />
of organization. A general approach to analysis of combinatorial 
<br />
components of informational signals is needed.
<br />
<p>The concept of relation differs among the categories of organization. 
<br />
For example, a biological relation may be expressed in terms of 
<br />
descendents and sexual mating activities.  A chemical relation may be 
<br />
expressed in terms of bonds among elements and molecules.  A 
<br />
mathematical relation is ordinarily expressed in terms of functions, 
<br />
mappings between two abstract objects, a domain and a codomain.  The 
<br />
different nature of the concept of relation between different degrees 
<br />
of organization contribute to polysema.  It also can restrict 
<br />
calculations and accounting principles for the individual economies 
<br />
within an ecosystem.  Relations within an ecosystem include 
<br />
mathematical, chemical and biological relations, that is, ecosystems 
<br />
are polyralational. The polyrelational nature of human health is a 
<br />
useful metaphor for the polyrelational nature of ecological economics.
<br />
<p>The ordinary usage of the term &quot;economics&quot; includes the concept of 
<br />
dynamic flows of goods and services within a system and among 
<br />
neighboring ecosystems.  The dynamics of flows within ecosystems is 
<br />
of enormous perplexity which is far beyond the scope of these brief 
<br />
remarks.  A few sentences introduce the critical features.  The flows 
<br />
include physical and material flows.  One flow of particular 
<br />
importance to all ecosystems is the continuous flow of oxygen and 
<br />
carbon dioxide.  The genesis of the planetary balance between plants 
<br />
and animals depends on the release of oxygen by plants after the 
<br />
carbon has been separated the &quot;dioxide&quot;. This gift of oxygen from 
<br />
plants to animals establishes the basis for respiration in the animal 
<br />
kingdom and is essential to the mammalian lifestyle.  Other 
<br />
ecochemical cycles (nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, etc) are critically 
<br />
important to sustaining the life cycles of both plants and animals.
<br />
<p>Quantitative work on ecological information flows is not common. 
<br />
However, the work of Robert Ulanowicz must be noted. His book, Growth 
<br />
and Development, Ecosystems Phenomenology (1987) deploys Shannon 
<br />
information principles in the analysis of ecosystem flow data.  The 
<br />
subsequent work, Ascendency, discusses both theory and observations. 
<br />
His views have influenced the development of the perspective 
<br />
presented here.
<br />
<p>The perplexity of polyrelational systems requires the study of mutual 
<br />
relations among systems representing different degrees of 
<br />
organization.  For example, the planetary cycles of chemical flows 
<br />
are sustained by biological life cycles.  Biological life cycles are 
<br />
sustained by chemical flow cycles. Sustainable flows thus emerge from 
<br />
both systems with boundaries and systems without boundaries. This 
<br />
interdependence of systems creates the foundations for ecological 
<br />
economics.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;These few brief paragraphs are directed toward generating a 
<br />
systematic set of categories that will contribute to a 
<br />
transdisciplinary discussion of information flows in ecological 
<br />
economics.
