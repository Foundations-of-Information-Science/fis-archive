Dear FISers:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you have synthesized the skeleton of a full 'info approach' to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenon of music. However, entering into concrete responses to the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biological, cultural, and abstract properties that are interacting within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the global phenomenon of music. 
</em><br />
<p>(Juan, without accent on the a, answers:) Well, I am sorry, but the subject
<br />
is indeed a prime example of today's &quot;interdisciplinarification&quot; of science!
<br />
There is hardly a scientific problem that now-a-days can be treated
<br />
exclusively within one discipline (unfortunately our universities are not
<br />
yet prepare for that fact!). And when it comes to information as the center
<br />
of attention, &quot;nadie se salva&quot;, as you say in Spain and I used to say in
<br />
Argentina!
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;At least, I suggest adding a previous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question to your three ones (below): WHY IS MUSIC SO PERVASIVE IN HUMAN 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SOCIETIES?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Your proposed question is really an expansion or clarification of what I had
<br />
in mind with my second question, WHY is there music? It is, indeed, the core
<br />
point I am trying to address in my posted FIS paper. As a short answer to
<br />
your (and my) question I would say: &quot;Because music is the expression of an
<br />
inborn human drive to train in the sophisticated and complex acoustical
<br />
information processing needed for the comprehension and formation of human
<br />
language&quot;. That's why music is not present in the animal realm (please don't
<br />
tell me that birds deliberately make MUSIC---they just communicate about
<br />
needs or theats, like chimpanzees do when they shriek and blabber---it's us
<br />
who interpret birdsong as &quot;music&quot;!).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a brief thought experiment let us deprive contemporary societies of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;music at all. No lullabies, no children songs, no groupal singing, no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ballads-folk-rock-rap..., no dancing... no orchestras, choirs, marches, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anthems, etc. (movies, TV, etc.). Quite many bizarre situations (more than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usual!) would arise. And let us also deprive human societies of two special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instinctive 'musics' of our species: laughter and crying. Indeed social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;life would become quite difficult --as it really happens in some daily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environments, but fortunately we can run to appropriate 'refuges'.
</em><br />
<p>An interesting and illustrative Gedankenexperiment! But I question whether
<br />
we should incorporate laughter and crying into the same category as music.
<br />
To clarify this, and other possible questions, we should really agree,
<br />
before this discussion goes any further, on WHAT music really is! I believe
<br />
that it has some structural ingredients that must be recognized and accepted
<br />
as defining attributes. Among these (see my opening paper and the background
<br />
FIS paper) we must include consonance and chroma, that &quot;curious&quot; circular
<br />
property of pitch. Otherwise we would quickly fall into the realm of &quot;sounds
<br />
in general&quot; (including noise), and lose the uniquely human aspect of music!
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, music --like some other arts-- represents in my opinion an enlargement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the primate emotional textures ('endogenous' social information, so much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;developed in our species).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I see it exactly the other way 'round!! (1) There is the evolution of human
<br />
language, and (2) To support it, a NEW, exclusively human, emotional
<br />
manifestation has developed: liking to listening and being motivated to
<br />
emitting musical sounds! 
<br />
<p>(From the opening paper:)&gt;&gt;Finally ...  I will also speculate on the
<br />
possibility of musics based on 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;carriers other than acoustic waves, e.g., &quot;optical music&quot; with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;electromagnetic waves, and show that it would not be possible to have the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;variety of fundamental attributes so essential for our own musical cultures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
(says Marijuán:)&gt;In that regard I wonder whether the 'Visual Arts' (eg,
<br />
classical painting) 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may be considered as genuine forms of 'optical music' and respond to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;similar sensory processes and interactions with memories (and  partake some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;related abstract 'forms').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Leaving aside the fact that in the visual arts one cannot find the
<br />
equivalents of musical consonance and chroma (because of the extremely
<br />
limited range of perceivable frequencies, see my background FIS paper), the
<br />
development of the visual arts has gone in a direction opposite to that of
<br />
(western) music. The former started as the depiction of concrete visual
<br />
images and then proceeded into more abstract representations, whereas in the
<br />
case of (western) music, it started with completely abstract forms bearing
<br />
no direct relation to real environmental sounds and only later incorporated
<br />
gradually more concrete, environmentally-related, tone structures (see last
<br />
Chapter of my book Physics and Psychophysics of Music, Springer Verlag, 1995).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In further exchanges we should try to progressively fill-in this rich 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;catalog of open questions (not to forget the relationship of music with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dancing, either)!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
For a discussion of the possible role of dancing, see W. Benzon, Beethoven's
<br />
Anvil, Basic Books, 2001 (judging from your earlier comments, you probably
<br />
would agree far more with him than with my points of view!)
<br />
<p>Regards,
<br />
<p>Juan
