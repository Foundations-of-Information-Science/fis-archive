<p>
Thank you Ray for your clarification concerning the history of ideas 
<br />
with regard to the mutual influences between the biosciences and 
<br />
engineering/technology. This is, I think, a key question in an 
<br />
interdisciplinary dialogue, where everyone is having particular 
<br />
phenomena in mind while at the sime time using the same words which 
<br />
are sometimes analogue, somtimes equivoc and sometimes synonym!
<br />
(Peter's &quot;Capurro's trilemma&quot;). If a biologist uses the word 
<br />
information in order to grasp a transformation that takes place as a 
<br />
living organism interacts with the 'Umwelt' then he is, I think, in a 
<br />
similar (!) situation as a linguist who says, that information is not 
<br />
just meaning, but that it is a given transformation of a cognitive 
<br />
structure (or, hermeneutical speaking, of a pre-understanding).
<br />
Information is, in the first case, a difference that makes a 
<br />
difference (Bateson) and in the second case is a difference that 
<br />
finds a difference (Luhmann). In both cases information is (following 
<br />
Weizsaecker and others) not a quality of something but a quality of 
<br />
something with regard to a (cognitive) structure. This is a triadic 
<br />
situation as underlined by Soeren (and semiotics). This is also what 
<br />
Kant says when he talks about qualities belonging to things and 
<br />
qualities that refer to a knower who adscribes them to (the 
<br />
qualities) of things. Information is, thus, an (our, or, more 
<br />
generally, a structure's) adscription of something (having its given 
<br />
qualities). It is, as E. Oeser puts it, a second order quality.
<br />
This is the reason, I think, why we can talk about information (in 
<br />
general) while at the same time having different phenomena in mind 
<br />
(and in our hands!). Think, for instance, about the concept of 
<br />
'information management'. Management is a concept that has to do with 
<br />
using means to certain ends (and is thus concerned with organisms 
<br />
that can understand the difference between means and ends...) but it 
<br />
is also concerned, for instance, with taking care of something... But 
<br />
all this discourse would be hardly of any (metaphorical) use for a 
<br />
biologist, although it is very important to, say, an economist.
<br />
kind regards
<br />
