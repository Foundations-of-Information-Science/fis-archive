Apart from joining Werner and Thorsten in their views on the coming
<br />
conference, I much appreciate their reference to Michael Conrad. Actually
<br />
one of the last issues of BioSystems contains a collection of papers
<br />
devoted to his memory (Vol. 64, 1-3, Jan. 2002). I reproduce below, for the
<br />
new people who have recently joined the list, the wonderful essay that
<br />
Michael posted in our discussion list,in may 98, on a topic very close to
<br />
the &quot;Realism &amp; Information&quot; discussion we had in last December. (see
<br />

<br />
consciousness section)   ---Pedro
<br />
<p><p><p><p><p>**********************************************
<br />
Two Cents: One for Objectivity and One for Subjectivity
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consciousness is undoubtedly one of the most
<br />
fundamental and difficult problems of human
<br />
existence. There are a number of problems
<br />
with a similar character: whether the universe
<br />
is finite or infinite, whether it has an origin and
<br />
will it have an end, is mathematical truth within
<br />
or above the material world, and so forth.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such problems were referred to as &quot;antinomic&quot;
<br />
by the philosopher Immanuel Kant. It means that
<br />
equally credible arguments can be given to both
<br />
sides of the issue.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural science, by and large, directs itself
<br />
to the description of nature in a way that
<br />
can be verified by experience and, in the case
<br />
of mathematics, to discoveries in the abstract
<br />
realm that can be verified in definite way. At one
<br />
time the extreme (logical) positivist philosophers
<br />
argued that experimental verification and logical
<br />
proof should be the criterion for mathematical
<br />
truth. The clarity advocated by this program brought it
<br />
into some difficulties. It is not possible to make the
<br />
criterion clear and precise. &quot;Two plus two are four or
<br />
time is green and purple all over&quot; satisfies
<br />
the criterion of logical truth, for example.
<br />
Furthermore, it has become clear that the
<br />
experimental and logical methods have limitations
<br />
even in the domains to which they are suited. Even
<br />
more to the point: it is hard to specify precisely
<br />
what domains they are suited to. Thus, the
<br />
computer scientist attempting to build artificial
<br />
intelligence is bound to face the issue of consciousness.
<br />
So is the neuroscientist who is interested in intelligence.
<br />
So is the physicist who is interested in the physics
<br />
of the observer. And so it goes.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable, under these circumstances, that
<br />
many people working in natural scientific and mathematical
<br />
fields would want to reconsider the issue of consciousness.
<br />
It seems to be inseparable from the empirical and logical
<br />
questions that are their traditional purview. But it does
<br />
not mean that the issue of consciousness has lost its
<br />
antinomic character. We may all be attracted to this
<br />
or that view, just as we may be more or less attracted
<br />
to different particular philosophical perspectives in general.
<br />
The expectation that common agreement will be reached, as
<br />
it frequently is in biochemistry or topology, is not so well
<br />
placed though. Why should not different individuals have
<br />
different views on these matters? Can you ever make
<br />
arguments that will compel the determinist to believe
<br />
in freedom, or to compel the free will man to believe he does
<br />
not have the freedom to wiggle his toe or not wiggle his toe?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose a principle of philosophical relativity. The principle
<br />
asserts that scientific theories should be open to different
<br />
interpretations on antinomic issues. The interpretation is
<br />
like a coordinate system in physics. If there is no good reason
<br />
for choosing one coordinate system over another, then they
<br />
should be equally good (the principle of physical relativity).
<br />
But in practice you still need a coordinate system. The lab
<br />
frame might be the best for some purpose. Similarly, in
<br />
pursuing natural science questions it may be necessary
<br />
to have a point of view; it may indeed be impossible not
<br />
to have a point of view. But it should, according to the
<br />
principle of philosophical relativity, be possible to
<br />
transform from one to another point of view and still
<br />
maintain the essence of the empirical or logical result.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would even regard this as a useful guide to the construction
<br />
of scientific theories, just as the principle of physical relativity is.
<br />
Quantum mechanics and Goedel's theorem are steps in the
<br />
right direction in this respect, though not completed steps.
<br />
They are open to many different antinomic interpretations.
<br />
How could a scientific theory that enforces either determinism
<br />
or free will meet the criterion of universal public acceptance
<br />
that is the ideal of traditional scientific theories? The fellow
<br />
who believes he has free will will say, with justification,
<br />
that it contradicts the facts of his experience. The fellow who asserts
<br />
determinism is entitled to assert the opposite. The best theory,
<br />
according to the principle of philosophical relativity, is one that
<br />
is constructed so that as nearly as possible it is open to antinomic
<br />
interpretations.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told, by the philosopher Deborah Conrad, that philosophical
<br />
relativity is a bad term. It has the implication that truth is relative.
<br />
Well, I made a mistake then. I was borrowing the term from physical
<br />
relativity, and going back further, making a twist (or stretch) on Poincare's
<br />
conventionalist approach to science. It seems to me that the principle of
<br />
philosophical relativity, by isolating the intepretative framework from
<br />
aspects that retain their publically accessible character as one transforms
<br />
from one to another interpretative framework, raises the standards of truth.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many questions arise. What if there is disagreement about
<br />
what is antinomic and what is not? The boundaries may be vague. How
<br />
does the principle apply to the historical sciences, where counterfactual
<br />
conditionals enter? Could it in practice lead to a breakdown of standards,
<br />
to exaggerated (or underexaggerated) claims about the effects of smoking,
<br />
for example, that are justified on the basis of philosophical relativity? As
<br />
indicated above I would regard the principle as an attempt to preserve as
<br />
nearly as possible the objectivity and public verifiability that traditionally
<br />
characterize science, but without denying the the ultimate inseparability
<br />
of these questions from interpretative ones that are antinomic. The
<br />
interpretative ones become the coordinate system that we cannot
<br />
escape; but we can choose which coordinate system that we dwell in,
<br />
and indeed can choose different ones for different purposes (including
<br />
aesthetic purposes). The philosophical relativity principle is
<br />
a principle of tolerance.
