                <p>
                    Dear Fis,
                    <br />
                <p>Both Stan and Jerry raise points about whether the fact of having figured out
                    <br />
                    how genetic information, in its abstracted and formalised version, can be
                    <br />
                    transferred between the living organism and its dna, does or will generally
                    <br />
                    improve a chemist's lot.
                    <br />
                    Both interjections address important questions.
                    <br />
                    Stan says:

                    </em><br />
                <p>The common question both Jerry and Stan raise, as I understand it, is:
                    <br />
                    Does the fact that a slight inner inconsistency has been found in our counting
                    <br />
                    system mean anything for actual science? Will the existence, extent and other
                    <br />
                    properties of the inner duality of the counting system allow modelling, even
                    <br />
                    simulating biology?
                    <br />
                    My answer is:
                    <br />
                    Yes, it does. By finding a. the principle, b. the numeric properties of a
                    <br />
                    basic
                    <br />
                    building block, the road is open to define a mathematical object which serves
                    <br />
                    well as an &quot;atom&quot;. The Lego building block, which the last posting explained
                    <br />
                    how to find, is a &quot;density with properties&quot; that certainly exists. This is
                    <br />
                    what
                    <br />
                    one calls an atom in chemistry.
                    <br />
                    Our semantic differences are just that, trade language differences.
                    <br />
                    The situation is comparable to that of writing a compiler that translates
                    <br />
                    input
                    <br />
                    (as a symbol arrangement on a commutative assembly) into output (as a symbol
                    <br />
                    arrangement on a sequenced multitude) and back. The data processing trade uses
                    <br />
                    its own slang. The meaning of the news this person advocates in FIS is exactly
                    <br />
                    that what you ask for, as future users of the compiler.
                    <br />
                    Your user requirements are a specific aspect of what the compiler can and will
                    <br />
                    do. In the data processing view chemistry is a part of user requirements.
                    <br />
                    It is
                    <br />
                    too early to discuss the user interfaces yet. The inner workings of the
                    <br />
                    compiler allow (and require) for the certain existence of logical objects that
                    <br />
                    have properties that can and cannot come to lie next to each other in
                    <br />
                    dependence of the properties.
                    <br />
                    The last time the task was attacked it had the name of &quot;Unified Field Theory&quot;.
                    <br />
                    The present approach presupposes the Field to be quite densely full with
                    <br />
                    mathematical objects which have predictable properties. The a-priori
                    <br />
                    structured
                    <br />
                    Field gets its a-priori structure from the slack (torsion, over- underdensity)
                    <br />
                    that exists between counting lines.
                    <br />
                <p>Your user requirements show the keen interest and high expectations you set
                    <br />
                    into the improved counting system. They are a bit early to discuss. Shannon
                    <br />
                    might have nodded friendly as they asked him: shall we be able to download
                    <br />
                    without wires music from computers and listen to them in a tiny device the
                    <br />
                    size
                    <br />
                    of a credit card? Yes, whatever can be enumerated, can be found on N. This was
                    <br />
                    Shannon's answer and dead right he was.
                    <br />
                    You ask me: shall we be able to build molecules that &lt;...please insert your
                    <br />
                    futuristic idea here...&gt;? The friendly answer is again: Yes, whatever can be
                    <br />
                    enumerated, can be found on N and, depending the case, on M, or on M, and,
                    <br />
                    depending the case, on N.
                    <br />
                    The user may not be satisfied with the technician's answer. Yet, presently
                    <br />
                    this
                    <br />
                    is the best answer you can get from the workshop.
                    <br />
                    Basic research has come up with a gadget. The gadget looks promising and basic
                    <br />
                    research swears by its ancestors' bones that it is that gadget all were
                    <br />
                    looking
                    <br />
                    for. This is the wheel, calendar, electricity, radio and the dishwasher that
                    <br />
                    each revolutionised whole societies in a historic dimension. Just, it happens
                    <br />
                    to have got evolved as a data processing question, and later migrated into the
                    <br />
                    philosophy of numbers, in fact, a kind of number theory, and that trade has as
                    <br />
                    an added disadvantage that its sales force does not have anything to carry
                    <br />
                    around in order to demonstrate the practicality of the wheel, the steam
                    <br />
                    engine,
                    <br />
                    etc. on, but the numbers. We deal with the order among our concepts as we
                    <br />
                    discuss how and what we measure.
                    <br />
                    The improved measurement instrument does have by itself, available at power-up
                    <br />
                    time, certainly existing subsets with definite properties, and these
                    <br />
                    properties
                    <br />
                    do simulate the basic ideas about neutron and proton+electron, and there are
                    <br />
                    only a few of them, and they have an intricate logical relation among each
                    <br />
                    other. Rest assured, the gadget does deliver usable concepts of atom so you
                    <br />
                    can
                    <br />
                    start building molecules in the not so distant future.
                    <br />
                    The fate of a great invention depends on many factors. The results of basic
                    <br />
                    research will become application in dependence of the behaviour of the people
                    <br />
                    surrounding basic research, the scientists and the science managers. How fast,
                    <br />
                    and for which applied science tailored to measure it will appear in an
                    <br />
                    application first, is a managerial question, not one of cuts and stitches.
                    <br />
                    Even, if the present audience does nothing to further the translation of
                    <br />
                    stereo
                    <br />
                    counting into his or any trade,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;*counting the cuts together with the stitches is a principle that will make
                    <br />
                    its way to the general public, by its own merits, inevitably, sooner or later.
                    <br />
                    *
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an idea for which the time is always right to propose, but in times
                    <br />
                    afore, computers were not as readily available, so the idea was impossible to
                    <br />
                    investigate (because it involves quite a lot of counting). There is a little
                    <br />
                    bit of common sense to this idea, and it smells to the layman, too, like it
                    <br />
                    could be useful in chemistry and theoretical physics.
                    <br />
                    It depends on many factors, how an idea translates into profit (whatever form
                    <br />
                    profit will appear in). Among the factors that influence the fate of this idea
                    <br />
                    you and your action or inaction are quite important and relevant.
                    <br />
                    Thank you for the inquiry whether one may model chemistry better than
                    <br />
                    heretofore by an improved counting system, which also considers the cuts along
                    <br />
                    with the stitches. The answer is positive: yes, this is the direction the
                    <br />
                    research is taking. More helping brains can well improve the speed and the
                    <br />
                    precision of the effort. Thanks again for thinking along.
                    <br />
