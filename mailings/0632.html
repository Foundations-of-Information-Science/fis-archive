Continuing on with Peter's questions, some more thoughts.
<br />
<p>2. Juan Roederer mentions:
<br />
<p>*******************************************************************************
<br />
This brings up a new element in information-processing, namely that of
<br />
decision-making
<br />
*****************************************************************************
<br />
<p>Questions 2: How natural and artificial decision making systems process
<br />
and create information?
<br />
<p>My response here depends on my response to Q1, the self-organization issue. 
<br />
We can either shuffle information or create new information. Shuffling can 
<br />
make information more useful to one or another agent (e.g., the information 
<br />
about spots in the butterfly genes is there, but not much use to the 
<br />
butterfly -- it has to get this information to the wings for it to be 
<br />
useful). This issue should not be underestimated, and I think that a lot 
<br />
more attention needs to be given to the usefulness of information. We could 
<br />
define information such that it must in some sense be useful, but this will 
<br />
not solve the problem. In fact it may well obscure the issues involved in 
<br />
usefulness.
<br />
<p>The Burch-Collier model for self-organized entrainment and level production 
<br />
in social systems requires, as I mentioned in my previous post, 
<br />
encouragement of variety and moderate top down constraint. Genuinely new 
<br />
information (and solutions) cannot be determined in advance, and their 
<br />
creation cannot be fully controlled. What we can do, though, is to 
<br />
facilitate their appearance by setting up encouraging conditions. This is 
<br />
more or less what we do when we set up the conditions for Bénard cell 
<br />
formation. The cells form themselves. In this case only one outcome is at 
<br />
all likely, but in more complex situations many outcomes can occur, and 
<br />
forcing one or another is not advantage (unless we are in a hurry, and can 
<br />
tolerate big mistakes). Self-organization allows the very conditions that 
<br />
create the problem to determine the conditions for a solution. The wise 
<br />
facilitator (manager, if you must), keeps the focus within the bounds of 
<br />
the problem, but does not select solutions, allowing them to merge through 
<br />
interactions and the elimination of irrelevancies. This way the solution is 
<br />
shaped by the conditions surrounding the problem. Note that this implies 
<br />
that all elements involved in the problem should participate, or else the 
<br />
problem is not really solved (unless we are especially lucky). Both the 
<br />
participants and the system are altered in self-organizing problem solution.
<br />
<p>3. Ted Goranson's
<br />
************************************************************************
<br />
work is in modeling the behavior of complex business enterprises,
<br />
primarily those that make stuff.
<br />
***********************************************************************
<br />
<p>Q3. Can we accumulate arguments that to manage and control complex
<br />
business enterprises, a new Information Science is necessary??
<br />
<p>Self-organization implies multilevel distributed control. What we need is a 
<br />
new paradigm of organization. That is all I will say right now.
<br />
<p>I will note, though, that if this model is anything close to correct, 
<br />
unilateral action to prevent terrorism will not be a solution, or will 
<br />
require large expenditures of force, or both. Can a terrorist destroy a 
<br />
civilized country merely by making it spend so much it exhausts itself in 
<br />
trying to protect itself? Maybe. There must be a credible threat that can 
<br />
be mounted at low cost, and the reaction has to be to prevent the threat 
<br />
rather than to find a mutual solution, and the required expenditure must 
<br />
approximate the value of what is to be protected. It is also worth noting 
<br />
that the cost to the terrorist is proportional to what they have to lose. 
<br />
Mutual solutions work both ways, as do mutual problems. On the 
<br />
self-organizing model all problems and solutions are really mutual, and it 
<br />
is more effective to work with your opponents' interests than against them, 
<br />
if this is at all possible.
