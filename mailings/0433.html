<p>
Dear colleagues and congeners,
<br />
<p>I thank Prof. Gary Boyd from Canada the sending (14 March 2002) of the
<br />
message enclosed below which I dare to assume it is necessary to diffuse
<br />
among some of us: humans who are learning to be increasingly aware about
<br />
the urgent need of finding out how humans must determine the humane
<br />
perspective for humankind.
<br />
<p>Hernán López-Garay from Venezuela has commented the content of that message
<br />
saying
<br />
<p>Mi estimado elohim:
<br />
<p>LA CAMPAÑA DE DESTABILIZACION Y BLOQUEO TOTAL AL GOBIERNO POPULAR Y
<br />
LEGITIMAMENTE ELECTO DEL PRESIDENTE HUGO CHAVEZ ES MONSTRUOSA. DICHA
<br />
CAMPAÑA --EN LA QUE LOS MEDIOS DE COMUNICACION JUEGAN UN PAPEL VITAL----
<br />
CREO FIRMEMENTE ESTA ORQUESTADA EN CONJUNCION CON LAS FUERZAS MAS
<br />
REACCIONARIAS TANTO DENTRO COMO FUERA DE VENEZUELA.
<br />
<p>The campaign for breaking the stability and totally blocking the popular
<br />
and legally elected Government of Presideent Hugo Chavez is monstrous.I
<br />
firmly believe that this campaign - in which mass media means are playing
<br />
the main role -  is jointly  orchestrated by the most reactionary forces
<br />
located inside and outside Venezuela
<br />
<p>DADA LA NEGRA HISTORIA DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS EN NUESTRO CONTINENTE (v.gr.
<br />
Chile, NIcaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Republica Dominicana, Guatemala,
<br />
COlombia, Peru, Uruguay...etc. etc. etc.)  Y OTRAS EVIDENCIAS, NO ME CABE
<br />
TAMPOCO DUDA DE QUE EL DPTO DE ESTADO Y LA CIA ESTAN METIDOS EN ESTA
<br />
CAMPAÑA.
<br />
<p>Based on the drak history of United States of America in our continent
<br />
(e.g. Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panamá, República Dominicana,
<br />
Guatemala, Colombia, Perú, Uruguay,...etc. etc. etc) and (based) on other
<br />
evidences, I would not have any doubt that the State Dept. and CIA are
<br />
involved in this campaign
<br />
<p>Un abrazo fraterno y latinoamericano
<br />
<p>Hernán
<br />

<br />
<p>I dare to argue that one of our main tasks in FIS is to identify the
<br />
sources of RELIABLE INFORMATION, but also to recognize who is interested in
<br />
organizing the DISINFORMATION and as well to denounce FALSE INFORMATION
<br />
SPECIALLY IN THE DOMAIN OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CONCERNS. There
<br />
are indeed minority groups in powerful positions who become experts in
<br />
lying in order to maintain their positions. In case we do not notice such a
<br />
danger it will become improper and contradictory to manage INFORMATION
<br />
without realizing that it is very often &quot;infected&quot; by political actions
<br />
that aim at disorganizing through defamation the efforts of people to build
<br />
their perspective supported by their own resources.

<br />
day cast upon them?&quot;

Venezuela: Next Chile? March 13,
<br />
2002
<br />
By John Pilger
<br />
<p>He has won two elections, and he has made a start on relieving poverty.
<br />
So now the US wants to get rid of Venezuela's president
<br />
<p>Almost 30 years after the violent destruction of the reformist government
<br />
of Salvador Allende in Chile, a repeat performance is being planned in
<br />
Venezuela. Little of this has been reported in Britain. Indeed, little is
<br />
known of the achievements of the government of Hugo Chavez, who won
<br />
presidential elections in 1998 and again in 2000 by the largest majority in
<br />
40 years.
<br />
<p>Following the principles of a movement called BolIvarism, named after the
<br />
South American independence hero Simon BolIvar, Chavez has implemented
<br />
reforms that have begun to shift the great wealth of Venezuela, principally
<br />
from its oil, towards the 80 per cent of his people who live in poverty.
<br />
<p>In 49 laws adopted by the Venezuelan Congress last November, Chavez began
<br />
serious land reform, and guaranteed indigenous and women's rights and free
<br />
healthcare and education up to university level.
<br />
<p>Chavez faces enemies that Allende would recognise. The &quot;oligarchies&quot;, which
<br />
held power since the 1950s during the corrupt bipartisan reign of the
<br />
Social Christians and Democratic Action, have declared war on the reforming
<br />
president, backed by the Catholic Church and a trade union hierarchy and
<br />
the media, both controlled by the right.
<br />
<p>What has enraged them is a modest agrarian reform that allows the state to
<br />
expropriate and redistribute idle land; and a law that limits the
<br />
exploitation of oil reserves, reinforcing a constitutional ban on the
<br />
privatisation of the state oil company.
<br />
<p>Allied with Chavez's domestic enemies is the Bush administration. Defying
<br />
Washington, Chavez has sold oil to Cuba and refused overflying rights to
<br />
American military aircraft supplying &quot;Plan Colombia&quot;, the US
<br />
campaign in support of the murderous regime in neighbouring Colombia.
<br />
Worse, although he condemned the attacks of 11 September, he questioned the
<br />
right of the United States to &quot;fight terrorism with terrorism&quot;.
<br />
<p>For this, he is unforgiven. On 5-7 November, the State Department, Pentagon
<br />
and National Security Agency held a two-day meeting to discuss &quot;the problem
<br />
of Venezuela&quot;. The State Department has since accused the Chavez government
<br />
of &quot;supporting terrorism&quot; in Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador. In fact,
<br />
Venezuela opposes American-funded terrorism in those three countries.
<br />
<p>The US says it will &quot;put Venezuela in diplomatic isolation&quot;; Colin Powell
<br />
has warned Chavez to correct &quot;his understanding of what a democracy is all
<br />
about&quot;. Familiar events are unfolding.
<br />
<p>The International Monetary Fund has indicated it supports a &quot;transitional
<br />
government&quot; for Venezuela. The Caracas daily El Nacional says the IMF is
<br />
willing to bankroll those who remove Chavez from office.
<br />
<p>James Petras, a professor at New York State University, who was in Chile in
<br />
the early 1970s and has studied the subversion of the Allende government,
<br />
says that &quot;the IMF and financial institutions are fabricating a familiar
<br />
crisis. The tactics used are very similar to those used in Chile. Civilians
<br />
are used to create a feeling of chaos, and a false picture of Chavez as a
<br />
dictator is established, then the military is incited to make a coup for
<br />
the sake of the country.&quot;
<br />
<p>A former paratrooper, Chavez apparently still has the army behind him (as
<br />
Allende did, until the CIA murdered his loyal military chief, opening the
<br />
way to Pinochet). However, several senior officers have denounced Chavez as
<br />
a &quot;tyrant&quot; and have called for his resignation. It is difficult to assess
<br />
this; in its rumour-mongering, the hostile Caracas press plays a role
<br />
reminiscent of Chile's right-wing press, with poisonous stories questioning
<br />
Chavez's sanity.
<br />
<p>The most worrying threat comes from a reactionary trade union hierarchy,
<br />
the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), led by Carlos Ortega, a hack
<br />
of the anti-Chavez Democratic Action Party. The CTV maintains a black list
<br />
of &quot;disloyal&quot; and &quot;disruptive&quot; members, which it supplies to employers.
<br />
<p>According to Dick Nichols, writing from Caracas, Chavez's most serious
<br />
mistake has been his failure to move against the union old guard, following
<br />
a national referendum in which a majority gave him a mandate to reform the
<br />
CTV.
<br />
<p>The crime of Hugo Chavez is that he has set out to keep his electoral
<br />
promises, redistributing the wealth of his country and subordinating the
<br />
principle of private property to that of the common good. Having
<br />
underestimated the power of his enemies, his current counter-offensive is
<br />
imaginative but also hints of desperation.
<br />
<p>He has set up what are called &quot;BolIvarian circles&quot;, of which 8,000 are
<br />
being established in communities and workplaces across the country. Based
<br />
on the revolutionary heritage of Simon BolIvar's triumph in the war against
<br />
Spain, their job is to ...&quot;raise the consciousness of citizens and develop
<br />
all forms of participatory organisations in the community, releasing
<br />
projects in health, education, culture, sport, public services, housing and
<br />
the preservation of the environment, natural resources and our historical
<br />
heritage&quot;.
<br />
<p>Allied to this is a popular command &quot;unifying and strengthening the forces
<br />
in support of President Chavez&quot;.
<br />
<p>These are fighting words that echo through the continent's history of epic
<br />
struggles. They say that yet another South American country, in offering
<br />
its people an alternative to poverty and foreign domination, the &quot;threat of
<br />
a good example&quot;, is entering a period of great uncertainty and fear. The
<br />
achievements in Venezuela are a clear response to those who say that
<br />
radical dreams and change are no longer possible. Chavez should be
<br />
supported by all democrats. Chile must not happen again.
