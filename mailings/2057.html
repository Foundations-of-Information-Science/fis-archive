<p>
Dear All,
<br />
<p>Continuing comments to Stan and Bob...
<br />
<p>Stan: Alas, my point was that EVERY culture has had wars and more wars,
<br />
and none have been able to explain it to our satisfaction.  (For example,
<br />
Ghengiz Kahn expressed satidfaction that Samarkand was converted into
<br />
grazing land for horses.  So he went to war to promote horse farming!)  So
<br />
I venture the simple explanation that we have been fated to be pulled into
<br />
wars because we cannot resist maximizing our energy usage.
<br />
<p>Igor: Stan's general metaphor is really suggestive of some real-life 
<br />
situations. Recently a friend of mine told me that he felt a strong excess 
<br />
of energy, so he tried to &quot;dissipate&quot; it by a long jogging in the park. It 
<br />
was, alas, not enough, and he decided to have a coffee in Ljubljana (a town 
<br />
in nearby Slovenia, 120 km from Zagreb!). So he drove there, had a coffee 
<br />
and returned back home, his energy finally dissipated (to his great 
<br />
satisfaction). When I remarked that it made little sense what he has done, 
<br />
he replied that the urge to expend his energy excess was just unbearable.
<br />
Second example: Hitler built the economic strength in the Third Reich mostly 
<br />
on military industry. He had to dissipate, eventually, this stored energy 
<br />
and material potential because otherwise it was not possible to continue nor 
<br />
to sustain the achieved socioeconomic state. He planned to use it to acquire 
<br />
new material and energy assets (the &quot;New Order&quot; of Europe) in order to 
<br />
sustain Third Reich. He failed but if he were to succeed, the new political 
<br />
and economic order would be highly unstable and the second wave of war and 
<br />
destruction would eventually come. The point is, once he has created such a 
<br />
high energy potential implicit in the military industry and weaponry stocks, 
<br />
subsequent destructive processes were simply unavoidable. We could see many 
<br />
great historic conquests and invasions trough these lenses: human societies 
<br />
first build high energy gradients and than rush to dissipate them. This 
<br />
process needs not to be literally inscribed in the Second Law, but it 
<br />
functions as if it were (I guess that we can view Stan's entropy conceptual 
<br />
framework also in this way).
<br />
The message to take home: perhaps we should be careful (and aware of the 
<br />
potential consequences) with accumulating high energy gradients in our 
<br />
modern society ??? For example, the current situation of the North vs. 
<br />
South, where North is accumulating energy in the form of weapons and 
<br />
technology and the South in the sheer number of people, but increasingly in 
<br />
industry and military sector as well. Both may eventually explode 
<br />
individually and clash mutually....
<br />
<p>SS: My take is that this works WITH the Second Law.  Indeed, since
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all gradients are unstable to metastable, they all must be dissipated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Autocatalysis, and any building-up tendency, is simply parasitic upon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this necessary dissipation.
</em><br />
<p>Bob's reply: I wouldn't agree. I can conceive of gradients existing for 
<br />
indeterminate
<br />
time without being dissipated. That's why we had fossil fuels. Human
<br />
society, which arose out of the solar gradient, for reasons vested in its
<br />
own autocatalytic economy, sought out and switched to fossil fuels to
<br />
serve those ends. Fossil fuels didn't force themselves upon humans, nor
<br />
did they beckon to humans simply to be dissipated (some current wasteful
<br />
human activities notwithstanding. :)
<br />
<p>Igor:  If I recall well, Schrödinger wrote that &quot;life thrives on low 
<br />
entropy&quot;. In the absence of energy gradients there is no life. On the other 
<br />
hand, energy gradients by themselves may not necessarily create life to 
<br />
degrade them. This argument can be seen in the Lee Smolin's book &quot;Life of 
<br />
the Cosmos&quot;, where he points at the astonishing number of improbable 
<br />
parameter values present in the elementary particles and in the atomic 
<br />
structure, which, if were slightly different would not allow the formation 
<br />
of basic, &quot;heavy&quot; elements the life is made of (carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus 
<br />
etc.). As we happen to live in the Universe where parameters are set right, 
<br />
so that life is in principle possible, we may expect life to evolve in the 
<br />
direction of dissipating extant energy gradients (both in terms of faster 
<br />
and more trough dissipation). If our Universe is definitely heading towards 
<br />
the heat death, than life may appear as an auxiliary force in the overall 
<br />
process - as Stan wrote: &quot;Autocatalysis, and any building-up tendency, is 
<br />
simply parasitic upon this necessary dissipation.&quot; However, even if we are 
<br />
pretty sure today that the Universe is accelerating we are not that much 
<br />
sure about the final outcome (i.e. the heat death or the Great Crunch), 
<br />
because of the dark energy and matter effects, which we just stumbled upon 
<br />
recently. Therefore, it is possible that there may be no Second Law 
<br />
&quot;ultimate finality&quot; in the processes at the level of the universe.
<br />
If we were to live in a different Universe, e.g. consisting of helium only, 
<br />
if I recall correctly, there would be no stars, no galaxies and, therefore, 
<br />
no energy gradients to dissipate. In such a Universe the Second Law may have 
<br />
no relevance at all. It is also possible that the Big Bang would have 
<br />
produced an Universe with energy gradients but no possibility for life to 
<br />
evolve. Providing that this universe is accelerating/expanding, these energy 
<br />
gradients would, eventually, disappear according to the Second Law.
<br />
This would be the perspective from the level of the total, closed system, - 
<br />
the universe. If we look at things from the perspective of the semiclosed 
<br />
sub-sub-sub system {galaxy, (solar system,  (Earth))}, than I agree 
<br />
completely with Bob and his argument about fossil fuels, which, in 
<br />
principle, may exist without ever being dissipated until the Sun burns out 
<br />
the whole solar system. The basic argument in favor of his statement is that 
<br />
human species was also an improbable event in the evolution of life, so the 
<br />
chance that there will no species able to dissipate energy bound in fossil 
<br />
fuels was extremely high.
<br />
I don't see Stan's and Bob's argument about the &quot;finality&quot; of life or 
<br />
entropy as being so irremediably apart, perhaps it is only the question of 
<br />
scale from which we look at systems and processes, and our preferred focus: 
<br />
organization vs disorder. On the other hand, if I look at Stan's &quot;entropic 
<br />
finality&quot; metaphor not in terms of our humanly conceived &quot;finality- 
<br />
as-purpose&quot;, but simply as a statement that there may be a single point 
<br />
attractor in the evolution of the universe - the heath death - that it 
<br />
appears to me perfectly acceptable.
<br />
<p>PS: you finally made it to distract me from my favorite &quot;earthly themes&quot; ...
<br />
<p>The very best
