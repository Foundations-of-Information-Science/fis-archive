<font size=4>Dear Luis<br>
Dear All,<br><br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4>Luis, I have seen your
interesting posting and I would like to add some comments.<br><br>
Actually, the Exergy Replacement Cost is our proposal (Valero and me) in
order to evaluate the physical cost of natural resources based on Second
Law of Thermodynamics. However, in agreement with Valero, the evaluation
of physical cost of natural resources is a very complex task: for
instance, what is the thermodynamic value of a forest? Of course the wood
can be used for producing energy, but what about the ecological functions
and services provided by a forest: oxygen production, soil protection,
climate regulation…? <br><br>
Up to now, the way we have found for evaluating those functions is
comparing the resources that humans would consume, with the present state
of the art of technology, in case they would substitute for nature. This
approach also presents the problem of technological efficiency, which is
far away from the theoretical (thermodynamic) maximum.<br><br>
</font>I think that the comparison with respect to the equilibrium state
is a good reference for establishing the ecological limits and the
carrying capacity of the Planet. In agreement with Valero and Naredo,
this procedure should be internationally accepted in order to measure the
distance of ecosystems with respect to the equilibrium.<br><br>
In my opinion, one of the most important key aspects is the
<b><i>production of mixtures</i>.</b> Industrial pollution basically is
provoked by mixtures of low concentration, most of them non-reactive i.e.
stable since a chemical viewpoint, and as a consequence very difficult to
be separated. In some cases the damage could be measured through the
entropy generation, or the exergy destruction, which is very similar. In
my opinion, if a good (comprehensive) evaluation method could be
developed, this could be a good measure of the pollution damage provoked
to the Planet.<br><br>
Moreover, applying Life Cycle Assessment methodology, the damage provoked
by the consumption of natural resources with high exergy content and the
effect on the sinks (atmosphere, rivers, oceans, soil…) could also be
evaluated through the entropy generated by the resulting mixtures. Again,
I think, that it would be a good measure of the environmental impact on
the Planet.<br><br>
There is a lot of work to do yet regarding the distance of ecosystems to
the thermodynamic equilibrium, and the function that ecosystems perform
in the address of reducing the entropy generated by humans. This could be
roughly the measure of the carrying capacity. However, it remains full of
unanswered questions. For instance, what happens with non-renewable
resources? What is the appropriate velocity of their
consumption?<br><br>
Greetings to all<br><br>
Edgar Botero<br><br>
