                <p>
                    Dear FISers,
                    <br />
                <p>I have enjoyed this QI topic and all the thought-provoking posts,
                    <br />
                    some of which are beyond my expertise but interesting nonetheless.
                    <br />
                    I�m a biologist with strong interests in evolutionary biology. So,
                    <br />
                    changing the discussion a little to suit my interests, the following
                    <br />
                    is my take on QI, as it pertains to evolutionary genomics.
                    <br />
                <p>On comparing genomes to black holes for interpreting biological
                    <br />
                    aspects of �quantum information�
                    <br />
                <p>How should a biologist, especially an evolutionary biologist,
                    <br />
                    differentiate �quantum information,� such as discretely digital
                    <br />
                    information, from information that is communicated continuously,
                    <br />
                    perhaps resembling analogs of wave functions? If this
                    <br />
                    differentiation is reasonable, could it shed light on the role of
                    <br />
                    �quantum information� (QI) in biosystems?
                    <br />
                <p>Firstly, I will assume Richard Dawkins (e.g., 1995) is correct in his
                    <br />
                    assertion that genes are pure, digital information. They contain
                    <br />
                    bits of information as nucleotides, bytes as codons, rendering the
                    <br />
                    genes themselves irreducible encryptions of whole proteins. I will
                    <br />
                    assume this qualifies them as QI. The continuous production of
                    <br />
                    variation by way of allele formation would be equivalent to a genomic
                    <br />
                    wave function, which I will assume to be collapsible when genetic
                    <br />
                    variation results in another speciation.
                    <br />
                <p>Imagine a genome with no alleles, which means it has only one
                    <br />
                    expression for each gene, and thus no genetic variation. From an
                    <br />
                    operational point of view, all the genetic information (or QI) is in
                    <br />
                    place; this genome might survive from generation to generation, so
                    <br />
                    long as no important changes occur along the way. But if an
                    <br />
                    important change occurs the genome will lack the variation it needs
                    <br />
                    to meet the challenge of adaptation. Variation, then, equates to a
                    <br />
                    continuous supply of QI generated by the genome. Variation also
                    <br />
                    equates to the entropy of a black hole, as viewed by theorists of
                    <br />
                    quantum gravity.
                    <br />
                <p>Stephen Hawking (2001, pp. 63-64), for example, theorizes that black
                    <br />
                    holes have both entropy and temperature: �We have come to recognize
                    <br />
                    that this standing still of real or imaginary time (either both stand
                    <br />
                    still or neither does) means that the spacetime has a temperature, as
                    <br />
                    I have discovered for black holes. Not only does a black hole have a
                    <br />
                    temperature, it also has a quantity called entropy. The entropy is a
                    <br />
                    measure of the number of internal states (ways it could be configured
                    <br />
                    on the inside) that the black hole could have without looking any
                    <br />
                    different to an outside observer, who can only observe its mass,
                    <br />
                    rotation, and charge.�
                    <br />
                <p>Setting aside the tempting question of genomic temperature, we can
                    <br />
                    draw a fair comparison between the internal configuration of a black
                    <br />
                    hole � its entropy � with that of a genome. Hawking says a black
                    <br />
                    hole�s entropy is the number of ways it can be configured on the
                    <br />
                    inside without appearing different on the outside. Likewise for a
                    <br />
                    genome; its alleles amount to the number different ways it can be
                    <br />
                    configured (on the inside) without appearing as a different species
                    <br />
                    to an (outside) observer. The more variation (entropy) a genome
                    <br />
                    possesses, the more QI it will have to survive random changes or
                    <br />
                    selective sweeps.
                    <br />
                <p>Hawking goes on to invoke the holographic principle to explain
                    <br />
                    quantum gravity: �This black hole entropy [S] is given by a very
                    <br />
                    simple formula I discovered in 1974. It [S] equals the area of the
                    <br />
                    [event] horizon of the black hole: there is one bit of information
                    <br />
                    about the internal state of the black hole for each fundamental unit
                    <br />
                    of area of the horizon. This shows that there is a deep connection
                    <br />
                    between quantum gravity and thermodynamics� It also suggests that
                    <br />
                    quantum gravity may exhibit what is called holography� If quantum
                    <br />
                    gravity incorporates the holographic principle, it may mean that we
                    <br />
                    can keep track of what is inside black holes.�
                    <br />
                <p>The holographic principle may also work well for biological species;
                    <br />
                    the complete genome of a species is contained in almost every cell of
                    <br />
                    its organisms. This mean that almost any cell, no matter where it is
                    <br />
                    located in vitro, should yield a complete organism if properly
                    <br />
                    cloned. And this holographic-like principle of cloning has been
                    <br />
                    unambiguously demonstrated.
                    <br />
                <p>In summery, the QI of genomes appears to be isomorphic with the QI of
                    <br />
                    black holes. This suggests to me that quantum gravity and quantum
                    <br />
                    genomics operate on similar principles. Furthermore, it implies that
                    <br />
                    QI is an important aspect of biological evolution, especially when
                    <br />
                    the genome is seen as an entropy generator for improving its
                    <br />
                    survivability.
