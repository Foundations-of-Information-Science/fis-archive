<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>At the beginning of this year there was a message by Koichiro where the 
<br />
problem of time surfaced quite ostensibly. There were some further comments 
<br />
by Rafael, Stan and myself, but  somehow the problem of time in its 
<br />
intimate relationship with meaning scaped almost un-touched. Again, some 
<br />
hints reappeared when arguing about &quot;what is meaning?&quot; --perhaps I dubbed 
<br />
as 'protean' some intriguing characterizations exposed then.
<br />
<p>In actuality, timing is at the essence of all nervous systems, even the 
<br />
simplest ones. For neuroscientist A. Berthoz (2003), most of scientific 
<br />
views (often in the neurosciences themselves) are biased towards the 
<br />
logico-formal aspects that may characterize some high-level brain 
<br />
functions, and the deployment of the actual behavior in time is disregarded 
<br />
almost as a physiological or biological side aspect. &quot;At the beginning was 
<br />
the deed&quot; he points out. How the brain has to handle --just to behave in 
<br />
the world-- the fantastic complexity of the biomechanic organization of the 
<br />
body, represents the original evolutionary function of nervous systems, and 
<br />
the key of all their further improvements. And language is an action too... 
<br />
with an incredible richness of associated vocal and auditory perplexities 
<br />
(Juan Roederer and Michael Leyton made several points about that in our 
<br />
discussion on music).
<br />
<p>I consider that some of the recent messages on semioticism have been too 
<br />
cavalier about the crucial part that natural sciences have to play in any 
<br />
explanations about the phenomenon of meaning (with nuances, I would join 
<br />
Pavel's comments). In chronobiology for instance there is the fascinating 
<br />
contents about rhythmicity of behavior ---partially described by Ernest 
<br />
Rossi in  those two old 'real' fis conferences fis 94, fis 96. I also made 
<br />
sort a claim about a robust parallel between the timings of language (and 
<br />
of meaning for that matter) and the time granularities affecting our 
<br />
'physiological' brain processes (receptors, channels, second messengers, 
<br />
metabolic paths and depots, protein synthesis, cell cycles, physiological 
<br />
rhythms, ultradian rhythms, ecological and reproductive rhythms, solar &amp; 
<br />
celestial... ). We take as 'natural', as transparent, that sophisticate 
<br />
architecture of timings, both in the meaningfulmess of our languaging and 
<br />
in the flow of our daily life.
<br />
<p>This very message contains a curious architecture of related timings: it 
<br />
has be located regarding an hour, a day, a month, a year, an era... it may 
<br />
mean something when one has just read it (e.g., particularly 'meaningful' 
<br />
if it contains some mild criticisms), and it will mean something else in a 
<br />
few hours; and perhaps it is tomorrow when the reader disengages himself 
<br />
from the more salient personally-related contents and focuses on possible 
<br />
subtle originalities and expansions of the ideas presented; and then around 
<br />
the other day the message is close to definitely sink into irrelevance: it 
<br />
looks rather old and meaningless, as one is now very busy digesting the 
<br />
meaningfulness of other incoming events.
<br />
<p>Am afraid this is getting too long (and accelerating its own time 'erasure').
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Next 5th of April, Monday, will be the beginning of the &quot;Entropy and 
<br />
Information&quot; conference; more info will follow soon. For the new parties 
<br />
just inscribed in the list --around half dozen from very different 
<br />
backgrounds-- we are now running at 'free wheel' without much discipline in 
<br />
the comments or the topics, though abiding by the limit of two postings per 
<br />
week. By the way, if the mathematicians of this list find it interesting, 
<br />
we could attempt during these two weeks an exploratory Preamble on a topic 
<br />
suggested by Jerry some time ago: Information, Accounting and Numbers.
