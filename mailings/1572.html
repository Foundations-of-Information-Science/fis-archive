Entropy is a concept. As a concept, it does have emotional connotations. On
<br />
the relaxing of a concept one can observe the process of a gradual
<br />
diminishing of tensions. If the concept of entropy is divested (derobed,
<br />
peeled off) of its emotional connotations, we see what ideas and feelings we
<br />
had attached to the concept of entropy, and also we see what remains - an
<br />
abstract structure that describes relations of semantic markers to their
<br />
usual, less deviated, most probable range, where they can remain and a kind
<br />
of peace begins.
<br />
Entropy has less tension than a non-entropic state. It also has, as was
<br />
pointed out, less information and less improbability. Then, it has something
<br />
else more. The property an entropic state has more than a non-entropic state
<br />
is, in my view, that it has more and smaller summands. More, shorter logical
<br />
sentences describe the entropic state than the deviating state. It is nearer
<br />
the idealised state - as far as we conceive the ideal state to be an
<br />
entropic state. (The ideal gas is made up of uniform units, the ideal
<br />
society has each one equal: lots of minimal differences.)
<br />
To have an ideal state that is not the actual state means that we need two
<br />
sets of descriptions. The state of one state-of-the-world is or may be
<br />
deviating relative to the state of the other state-of-the-world, and this in
<br />
differing extents.
<br />
It would be well suited that once we regard the present quality of the
<br />
entropic (or not so much entropic) state and on the other hand we regard the
<br />
temporal changes of the entropic (or not so much entropic) state. How it is
<br />
does determine how long it will stay so. If it is so for a long time, it
<br />
cannot be an oddity. If the assembly is well ordered, one will observe
<br />
periodically that it is as expected. (Venus transit today.)
<br />
This is a complicated matter and we have to work honestly to grasp the
<br />
depths of a well-ordered system (like biology).
<br />
<p>Having the temporal aspect of a system contrast with the momentary
<br />
Geartetheit (being-so; being differentiated into such, German) allows us to
<br />
conceptualise the gradual easing of polarisations, the reduction of
<br />
alienation and the general dissipation of tensions, until we have sweet
<br />
harmony and peace, where all subsystems are as they should be. Is this
<br />
celestial harmony what we mean with entropy?

Betreff: [Fis] other entropies?
<br />
<p>Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>Let me add a couple of new aspects to the many interesting topics around
<br />
(apologies for further diverting out):
<br />
<p>First about Tsallis' Entropy. As the defenders of this relatively new
<br />
approach to entropy claim (late 80's), the classical entropy around
<br />
Clausius-Boltzmann, assumes ergodicity of the state space, vicinity to
<br />
equilibrium, and extensivity. But what happens when your state space is
<br />
severely limited by multiple 'accidents' that do not let  the system move
<br />
ergodically, or when the system is far from equilibrium, or nonextensivity
<br />
is the rule? Then the new entropy modifies with a power law the classical
<br />
one (it contains a &quot;q&quot; factor describing the emerging fractality of the
<br />
state space; if q equals 1, then Boltzmann entropy follows). This new
<br />
approach has been explored in a variety of fields, and it looks very
<br />
intriguing in order to follow the &quot;cascades&quot; and discontinuities of the
<br />
energy flow in biology (life is but the paradise of 'bonds' which link
<br />
together, 'glue in' the vagaries of component entities: molecularly,
<br />
cellularly, individuals, socially...). Seemingly the inspiration for this
<br />
new entropy comes from comments by Einstein in 1910. See at the Web:
<br />
tsallis.cat.cbpf.br
<br />
<p>Second, 'multiscale entropy'. It is a fact that physiological time series
<br />
often exhibit novel features at different scales (e.g., heart beat
<br />
intervals) and their entropy could vary according to the timescale at which
<br />
it is measured. By re-sampling the original time series at various scales
<br />
(creating sub-samples) a collection of data possesing different
<br />
coarse-graining may be obtained ---I am awfully summarizing from Chiavo,
<br />
2002. The resulting quantity termed 'multiscale entropy' appears as a
<br />
function of time, and surprisingly it is almost constant for healthy
<br />
individuals, while it ostensibly increases or decreases for heart
<br />
pathologies (congestion, fibrillation)... The underlying wisdom is that the
<br />
biological organism looks for  a 'constancy of surprise' in its inner
<br />
arrangements and evaluations. It is quite a profound theme, that the author
<br />
(Chiavo) relates to our operations on other perceptual items (eg., sound,
<br />
music itself), and that I cannot help but relate to the 'value' theme both
<br />
in biology (fitness) and in our social-economic practices (myopic,
<br />
'congestive' unsustainable approaches to economic value--this might be an
<br />
interesting theoretical question for the environmental economics debate).
<br />
<p>I was willing to say  something on 'order' too. Shouldn't the 'criteria' be
<br />
antecedent, rather than otherwise (looking for the criteria)? I mean, items
<br />
get 'ordered' or 'disordered' with respect to some previous criteria held
<br />
by the observer --change the criteria, the evaluation result will change.
<br />
The same (half-neat) room is highly disordered for the toddler, who will
<br />
playingly act so to get it completely 'ordered' for his
<br />
perception---appearing then in complete randomness for the adult. The same
<br />
'action/perception' cycle underlies the child and the adult, but from a
<br />
very different memory-rule guidance (criteria); and also in the case of the
<br />
scientific observer...finally science is based on conventions and covenants
<br />
to socially build and expand a repertoire of knowledge that stems out from
<br />
the motor-based cognition of the individual.
<br />
<p>best
<br />
<p>Pedro

<br />
pleasure that he is again in the fis arena!
