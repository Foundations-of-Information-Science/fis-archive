( Hi Pedro, ----sorry for not contributing to the discussion.  There was a 
<br />
slot in
<br />
December when I did try to respond to a bunch of remarks that were made in
<br />
phrasing the question which I never got around to completing.  For your
<br />
interest I am sending this fragment to you. Hope you are well.    ---Sri )
<br />
<p>Many thanks, Sri, it is a splendid text and I am reintroducing it into the 
<br />
list.  greetings. ---Pedro

<p><p>Introductory Remarks: 12 Questions about relations between molecular
<br />
bionetworks and information theory
<br />
<p>(by Jerry L.R. Chandler)
<br />
<p>1. From an informational perspective what would constitute a definitive
<br />
theory of the information content of molecular bionetworks?
<br />
<p>&quot;Historically, in the 1840s, Kirchoff's theory of flow in electrical
<br />
networks grounds the metaphor of the conceptual framework for
<br />
molecular bionetworks.  However, the relatively simplicity of the flow
<br />
of electrons in comparison to the flow of life restricts the analogy
<br />
severely. Nevertheless, biomolecules are composed from electrical
<br />
particles and certain electron flow patterns are intrinsic to
<br />
metabolic networks in living systems.&quot;
<br />
<p>The &quot;relative simplicity&quot;  of electron flow is at some level a
<br />
primitive whose kernel needs to be split open.  In some ways, this
<br />
already taps into one of the qualifying statements one needs to put in
<br />
place when talking about information in biological, specially
<br />
biomolecular systems.  That crucial ingredient is one of coupling of
<br />
systems and the internal vs external descriptions of processes.  I'll
<br />
come back to this later -- hold that thought.
<br />
<p>The mere transport of matter is not always the key to determining
<br />
&quot;flows&quot; and thus, one could say that there is a non-trivial sense in
<br />
which the relationship between current (as flow of electrons) is
<br />
related to information flow (as flow of something else).  Individual
<br />
electrons are not physically transported across macroscopic distances
<br />
in order to give rise to macroscopic currents.  In biomolecular
<br />
networks, and in particular, signalling networks, the transfer of a
<br />
signal is not accompanied by the flow of matter.  Heat flow is another
<br />
more mundane example.  Jerry articulates the rhetorical bridge between
<br />
questions 2 and 3 as follows:
<br />
<p>&quot;2. From the perspective of information, how is it possible that
<br />
bionetworks construct the informed flows of electrical current flow and
<br />
how is it related metabolic flows?
<br />
<p>Historically, the investigation of empirical basis of molecular
<br />
bionetworks (metabolism) started shortly after Pasteur's pioneering
<br />
experiments on the causes of fermentation (1870s).  At that time, the
<br />
fermentation of grape juice was difficult to control but of great
<br />
economic importance.  (Bad wine sells cheaply!)  Quantitative analysis
<br />
of yeast fermentations showed that each molecule of glucose generated
<br />
two molecules of the 2-carbon alcohol and two molecules of carbon
<br />
dioxide. The yeast cell informed the specific destruction of the
<br />
sugar.  (If the 6-carbon sugar was merely burned, then it produced
<br />
exactly six molecules of carbon dioxide.)  Thus, the thermodynamic
<br />
question of why the yeast cell did not completely burn up the 6-
<br />
carbon sugar entirely into carbon dioxide arose.
<br />
<p>3. From an informational perspective, what does this incomplete
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fermentation process of glucose suggest about the role of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thermodynamics in living processes?&quot;
<br />
<p>Jerry' s third question focuses in on the issue of controlled
<br />
burning of sugar (glycolysis), which throws up the connection with
<br />
efficiency of heat engines studied in 19th century thermodynamics.
<br />
The flows of caloric had to be understood in order to harness the
<br />
energies of the Industrial Revolution.  Contemporary interpretation of
<br />
caloric underscores the fact that heat is not a quantity; it reflects
<br />
a transfer that summarises the changes in internal degrees of freedom
<br />
of bodies in contact.  In the context of this discussion group, these
<br />
degrees of freedom are quantitatively summarised by the notion of
<br />
entropy.  Once again, the conceptual machinery that is brought into
<br />
play to advance our understanding is in the establishment of new
<br />
theoretical summaries of phenomenologically useful constructs which
<br />
then go on to have a life of their own, some legitimate, others
<br />
perhaps more profligate and less discerning.
<br />
<p>Particularly in the confines of micron-length cells, the diffusional
<br />
processes that constitute the microscopic determinants of caloric
<br />
flows can and do play roles that, despite the uniformity of the underlying
<br />
physical laws, gives rise to properties take on biological
<br />
significance.  In the low Reynolds number environs of the cell, where
<br />
dissipative forces swamp intertial motion, motion by diffusion can be
<br />
surprisingly quick.  Even when there is a close coupling between the
<br />
burning of chemical energy supplies (such as ATP) to fuel movement (as
<br />
in the case of kinesin trucking along microtubular highways of the
<br />
cell's transportation system, diffusive contributions are part of the
<br />
chemical cycle that drives this locomotion.  I'll come back to this
<br />
later, but let me float this subliminal link between motion, chemical
<br />
cycles, diffusion (as random motion) as we return to Jerry's
<br />
articulation of the program that determines controlled conversion of
<br />
substrate to product:
<br />
<p>&quot;The code of the cell for fermentation was that each chemical reaction
<br />
was catalysed by an informed agents, termed zwishenferments.  These
<br />
agents are now known as enzymes. Thus, the question of how a cell
<br />
knows how to ferment sugar was regressed to a deeper informational
<br />
question:  How does an enzyme know how to inform a chemical change?&quot;
<br />
<p>Recasting this back in terms of the engines of the 19th and the
<br />
chemical engineering works of the early 20th century, this might be
<br />
the time to relate this question to Pedro' s segue into the basics of
<br />
the problem of molecular information:
<br />
<p>&quot;If I could bring order into these studies, the starting point, or say
<br />
one of the basic pillars of  the &quot;information bridge&quot; upon the
<br />
biomolecular turbulent waters, in my opinion, should be built around
<br />
the characterization of molecular recognition events, downwards and
<br />
upwards.&quot;
<br />
<p>Enzymatic modulation of reaction rates of biomolecular reactions have
<br />
often been characterised as requiring molecular recognition events
<br />
metaphors such as lock and key, induced fit, etc.  have been used
<br />
as short cuts to think through the effective behaviour of quantum
<br />
mechanical events averaged in some sense at the length and time
<br />
scales relevant to macromolecular biochemistry.  If substrate and
<br />
product can be interpreted as input and output of a program, surely
<br />
the enzyme appears as the quintessential elementary biomolecular
<br />
program, executing its embodied logic. However, again I hover with
<br />
my earlier hint of the need to consider biomolecular systems from an
<br />
internal or external viewpoint.
<br />
<p>Once a particular subsystem has been isolated for inspection,
<br />
experimentation and analysis, the rest of the system, indeed the
<br />
*organism*, is viewed as external to it.  This list needs no reminder
<br />
that holism demands surgical sequestration for discursive convenience
<br />
should not eliminate the need for creative reconstruction of the
<br />
whole.  Thus, mere biochemical currents, be they transfers of ionic
<br />
components, relative concentrations of (say, covalently) modified and
<br />
unmodified proteins, and so on, derive &quot;meaning&quot; only in the context
<br />
of downstream processes the subsystems are coupled to.  And in a
<br />
broad-brush sweep, this meaning is typically subservient (at the
<br />
biomolecular level) to the necessity of the organism to stay alive and
<br />
well.  While this does seem rather crude and reductionist, I have
<br />
inserted the qualifying locator -- at the biomolecular level.  I do
<br />
not intend to characterise the downstream effects of calcium influx
<br />
into a neuron of someone reading this message on the FIS list as one
<br />
of a mere battle for survival, although some would associate that in
<br />
the evolutionary scheme of things to such possibilities.   Yes, and
<br />
are these the downwards and upwards functional units that Pedro refers
<br />
to?  I believe they are exactly in the spirit of Jerry's remark that
<br />
&quot;Biomolecular networks consist of all the molecules in a cell.  One
<br />
crucial feature of such networks is the capacity to generate biological
<br />
functions.&quot;
<br />
<p>So I will be rather bold here to suggest a broad answer to Jerry's
<br />
fourth question:
<br />
<p>&quot;4. From an informational perspective, what is the nature of the code
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that an enzyme contains such that it conducts an informed catalytic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process? &quot;
<br />
<p>Since information is a short-cut we propose from the externalist
<br />
perspective to the causal links between subsystems, we need to
<br />
identify the physical features of an enzyme in its biological context,
<br />
as part of the network.  Thus we need to characterise the network
<br />
properties -- numbers of each species, the conformational states,
<br />
their free energy or chemical potential representations, etc., note
<br />
their dynamics in the presence of noise.  Each of these is a potential
<br />
&quot;signal,&quot; each of these could be imbibed with &quot;meaning&quot; by the
<br />
organism.  Since fluctuations are the norm within a cell, each of
<br />
these physical quantities, each with potentially &quot;meaning&quot;-laden
<br />
attributes can be characterised by probability distributions, from
<br />
which the more familiar entropic definitions can be proffered.  Some
<br />
of these will only be useful once the temporal windows over which key
<br />
biological events are meaningful have been identified.  One can begin
<br />
to articulate a general outline, but there needs to be an accumulated
<br />
body of systems where such a program has had some empirical clout,
<br />
else this would &quot;not even be false&quot; to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli.
<br />
<p>I will ignore the rest of Jerry's questions which have to do with DNA
<br />
as there has been lots written about the genetic code and its
<br />
information content, etc.  I don't think there is a lot to be learnt
<br />
from general considerations of that sort, despite their popularity and
<br />
books such as The Selfish Gene.  However, there is one aspect that he
<br />
mentions -- that of the temporal dimension to biological processes
<br />
that I will come back to in order to revisit Pedro's question about
<br />
the centrality of molecular recognition events.  Time plays an
<br />
important role in that.
<br />
<p>Let me point out a formal computational framework within which this
<br />
could be brought together as a programme of thought, perhaps in the
<br />
sense of Lakatos.  For inspiration I need to acknowledge Gordana's
<br />
post, but more importantly the simple framing that Kevin Kirby
<br />
provided in his forst posting:
<br />
<p>&quot;One way to further this approach is to turn to biological systems, and
<br />
take a look at the simulation relation. How do we say a biological system
<br />
computes X? Well, we see if there is a dynamics-preserving mapping
<br />
between inputs and states of the biological system and a given formal
<br />
system for X. This relation is usually written as a commutative diagram.
<br />
The simulation relation is central in automata theory and was recast into
<br />
a category-theoretic framework by Arbib and Goguen (taking different
<br />
approaches).   But the notion of a mapping between a biological system
<br />
and a formal system, seems to be, at first glance, a category mistake!
<br />
As soon as one identifies a fragment of nature as a system, one has
<br />
locked in some set of states, and it is hard to separate the true
<br />
computational power of a living system from what accrues merely to our
<br />
conventional state assignment. This is taken up nicely by the philosopher
<br />
David Chalmers in a response to a very strong statement at the
<br />
conventionality end by Hilary Putnam. (One could see this as a recasting
<br />
of the debate in Plato's Cratylus in computational terms!)
<br />
<p>This tension between the formal and the material seems to lie at the
<br />
heart of the field of natural computing. The work of Michael Conrad
<br />
emphasized the special role of biological material to explain the
<br />
fantastic outcomes of evolution, as opposed to any power inhering in the
<br />
class of relatively simple Darwinian algorithms.  In the
<br />
mutation-absorption model of the enzyme, we can begin to see how
<br />
computational power emerges from the breakdown in the simulation
<br />
relation, by the failure of commutativity (and, in the mathematical
<br />
sense, the creation of torsion).  This seems to be the vexing locus of
<br />
this new field: clarifying precisely what happens when formal systems
<br />
fail to track changes in fragments of nature.&quot;
<br />
<p>Even before I can articulate what I wanted to say, I have this nagging
<br />
feeling that I am about to get mired in questions on the Axiom of
<br />
Choice here, but since my grasp of such matters is minimal, let me
<br />
carry on anyway.  If indeed one can lay out the physical foundations
<br />
of meaning making -- the its of the biological network and their
<br />
attendant physical (mathematical) properties as I have pointed to, and
<br />
one lays out the functional attributes of biological systems, we might
<br />
have just the sort of setting that Kevin talks about.  However, given
<br />
the different time scales for describing the relevant events, the
<br />
different steady states and transients defined with respect to some
<br />
biologically determined processes, it would be necessary to have at
<br />
hand mutiple mappings and formalisations of this sort.  And here we
<br />
might need to extend the sorts of mappings Barwise (and Seligman)
<br />
define and exemplify in their monograph.  The infomorphisms between
<br />
different type systems would have to be generalised to these
<br />
formal-physical mappings carved up from our externalist perspective,
<br />
but which would provide the appropriate glue to not preclude the
<br />
internalist view as well.
<br />
<p>(For those not familiar with Barwise and Seligman, here's how I
<br />
remember what they do.  They construct analogs of a continuous
<br />
function in basic calculus.  In fact, their construction has a
<br />
category-theoretic construction via Chu spaces, for which the
<br />
high-school definition of a continuous function emerges as its
<br />
realisation in the category of topological metric spaces.  The
<br />
inclusion relationship between points in the range of a function and
<br />
its preimage to the the sets in the domain and range has to be
<br />
specified to define a continuous function.  Roughly, the direction of
<br />
arrows in a mapping (X to Y) and the relations of inclusions of open
<br />
sets in the domain and range which contain the paired points of
<br />
interest are in opposite directions.  Similarly, instances or events
<br />
are all given a type in a classification scheme (rather like elements
<br />
and the sets they are contained in) so that events of a certain type
<br />
are meant to carry information about events of a different type is a
<br />
statement about the relationship between two classification
<br />
systems. This map also has the same bi-directional nature as one would
<br />
expect of sets in the domain and range of functions that have the
<br />
property of being continuous.  Such a map is called an infomorphism.)
<br />
<p>These different classification schemes could be used to characterise
<br />
the physical features and their biological, interpretive counterparts,
<br />
at different scales, with different, possible overlapping subsystems,
<br />
each with different functional roles in the whole.  That is no more
<br />
than an outline.  It will take a lot of effort to put this programme
<br />
into practice and realise it in empirically worthwhile ways.  Any takers?
