<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>I am making a few comments on Edwina &amp; John C past messages:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[ET} I'm not saying that the truth is always clear-cut. I am saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that our experience must be open to validation. That a belief cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be self-affirmed. Clear cut beliefs are operative in ideologies, such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as those that are forever being posted to this list by Elohimi (sorry,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can't recall the name properly] and they are not only ungrounded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but not open to verification.
</em><br />
<p>I am reminded on Ortega y Gaset's distinction between 'ideas' and 'befiefs' 
<br />
(Rafael brought this very point to our list a couple of years ago). While 
<br />
one 'has' or may have ideas, one 'is' in the beliefs. It may look more 
<br />
adequate than the other dichotomy 'opinion' vs. 'knowledge' put by Edwina, 
<br />
though it also misses some interesting aspects.
<br />
<p>Before the elaboration of 'ideas' there are some individual and social 
<br />
processes of interest.  I would roughly sum them up as follows: a prior 
<br />
'acknowledgement' (that there is something unknown of interest), 
<br />
'perception' (the sustained focusing of our perceptual and mental skills), 
<br />
'opinion' (conceptualizations liberally exchanged and socialized), 'ideas' 
<br />
(more systematized and put into schemes), 'beliefs' (to be defended), and 
<br />
finally 'dogmas' (that simply cannot be discussed)... The argument to 
<br />
explore is that the former parts of that train of thought are but the 
<br />
social equivalent of an abduction process --congruent and built upon the 
<br />
previous nervous system' and cellular ones?
<br />
<p>(By the way, to Edwina, Elohimjl is the name you could not spell 
<br />
properly--I believe you complained once to Jerry about his 'Edwinia' 
<br />
spelling. The best for our list, with all its heterogeneity of backgrounds 
<br />
and fields, is to keep a discussion atmosphere of strong courtesy and 
<br />
tolerance.)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for the truth being rational, I believe that our world does operate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logically rather than randomly. Certainly, randomness exists as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well as freedom (not the same thing), but, overall, both freedom and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic interact in a 'logical' manner. And our perceptions must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always be open to validation, or, rejected. I can continue to believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a flat earth, but I must allow that belief to be open to proof.
</em><br />
<p>The fraction of living happenstances in 'our world' that can finally be put 
<br />
into a formal, logical scheme is astonishingly small. Including the 
<br />
sciences themselves (not to speak about the economy and our social life). 
<br />
That is the hard fact that for instance put into a modest scheme the Art. 
<br />
Intel. great hype of decades ago. Cellular and neuronal 'intelligence' are 
<br />
orders of magnitude above their artificial counterparts, based on 
<br />
principles and 'new maths' that we do not contemplate appropriately yet. 
<br />
Logicism, in the way it is treated above, is not definitely the main engine 
<br />
behind individual and social accumulation of knowledge. So, to put it a 
<br />
couple of words: 'economy' versus 'entropy', without forgetting 
<br />
'complexity' and 'elegance'.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[JH} Aren't opinions and beliefs only paradigms with varying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;degrees of fallability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; according to time and place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[ET] No. You are taking a relativist view, which links the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opinion/belief to a particular society/culture. I don't agree with this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for that denies the reality of the external world. The opinion must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kept open to ongoing validation. I cannot conclude, now and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;forever, that X is true. I can only conclude that, according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidence, at the moment, X is valid, but further research might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change that conclusion.
</em><br />
<p>The reality of the external world in the context of science is a discussion 
<br />
of its own (I recognize it has been postponed a couple of times here--some 
<br />
day it  has to be treated). More than establishing a logical 'truth' the 
<br />
problem of life becomes capturing the 'relevance' of the different 
<br />
cognizing perspectives that can be applied into the context. One can 
<br />
produce endless logical statements about any occurrence --stumbling upon 
<br />
the most relevant aspect of the occasion is the biggest problem, which 
<br />
usually we take for granted. In the context of the different sciences, I 
<br />
call it the 'interdisciplinary problem' --what of the multiple existing 
<br />
bodies of knowledge would apply given the numerous surrounding constraints? 
<br />
In my opinion it could be subsumed under the intricacies of the 'abduction' 
<br />
conceptualization (thanks a lot to John C. for his posting with the abd. 
<br />
stuff he checked about)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[JH] However, the statement may not be completely unfounded. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence says that female gang
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rape is less prevalent than the male variety and that men aren't much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; breastfeeding.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[ET] You are trying to preserve a fallability by irrelevant examples! If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I put forward the hypothesis that women are as violent as men,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then, that hypothesis can't be disproven by the example of 'inability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to carry out gang rape', for violence is carried out in multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;manners. Equally, the physiological fact that men do not have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hormonal capacity to provide milk, says nothing about nurturing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behavioural capacities in men. That is: the  ability to provide milk is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not the sole indicator of the ability to nurture.
</em><br />
<p>The most relevant piece of knowledge is, in this case, the new concoction 
<br />
of ecology and neurobiology that Allman and others have developed 
<br />
(curiously, in parallel with the growing 'eco' impact upon the emerging 
<br />
evolution-development field --evo-devo). For Homo sapiens, the violence and 
<br />
nurturing behavioral complexes are definitely well separated between the 
<br />
sexes (it does not mean that they are not 'plastic' and can be relatively 
<br />
molded by social life). The neuro and molecular stories underlying our 
<br />
emotional and behavioral (eco) adaptive traits are just fascinating. This 
<br />
is not the old sociobiological reductionism, it is great interdisciplinary 
<br />
science, really sober and prudent (and perhaps, lacking the spice and the 
<br />
hot conflicting elements, it has not make an impact: 'salience' and 
<br />
'relevance' do not always go hand with hand). Then, in what extent can 
<br />
social life counteract nature's propensity designs? I do not really know, 
<br />
but I have scholarly references about the contemporary rate of violent 
<br />
crimes of men vs. women in Western countries: it is about an order of 
<br />
magnitude (10 to 1).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[JH} But if information is knowledge-independent (say as part of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pure information states as in 'It from Bit') then the misinformation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 'distorted' form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the primary matter - 'men are violent' distorts the true nature of men 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as non-violent and nurturing beings (:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[ET] I disagree with the statement that 'information is knowledge-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independent'. It is knowledge-dependent. What is going on, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe, is an evolving 'knowledge' where bits of matter are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'informemd' (set up into relations). These relations operate within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical interaction; they are not random or the matter would rapidly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dissolve. The relations, as operative in the logic, are knowledge-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dependent. But, this knowledge cannot be isolate. It cannot be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-asserted belief. It has to enable information 'bits' to emerge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that are validly operative in the real world.  Also, there is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing as a 'primary matter' in the sense that the emergent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information is a copy of it (that's Platonic, and I'm not a Platonist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is primary energy which is formed, by logical relations, into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter.
</em><br />
<p>That´s quite a cosmological scheme. I am really curious on what physicists 
<br />
would say about it.
<br />
<p>To put an end to my comments:
<br />
John H. is preparing the next batch of papers --Florido, Benking, Brier, 
<br />
Fuchs. Let us enjoy in anticipation, and let us start the readings...
<br />
<p>best wishes
