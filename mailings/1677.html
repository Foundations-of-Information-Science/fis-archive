<p>
Replying (first to Loet):
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stan's model, for example, raises the question of whether our society is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mature&quot; or &quot;senescent&quot;. Or should we say that the European society is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;senescent&quot; and the American one &quot;premature&quot;? :-) It seems to me that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always has to write these metaphorical uses of terms between quotation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;marks. The mathematics indeed may be helpful for the translation.
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thi is a natural kind of question to ask with regard to this (or any)
<br />
model.  I need to point out a few things in this regard.
<br />
(1) The terms, 'immature', 'mature' and 'senescent', as I use them, are
<br />
very much generalized into information theoretical and thermodynamic
<br />
(infodynamic)terms, so that they should be applicable AS SUCH, directly to
<br />
any kind of system.  Unfortunately the labels themselves are associated by
<br />
most folks with biology.  It would be a question of creating neologisms to
<br />
replace these terms.
<br />
(2) Comparisons among different instances of the same kind of system are
<br />
more difficult and less secure than comparisons between stages within one
<br />
system.
<br />
(3) Especially with systems of larger scale than our organismic
<br />
observational scale, as when considering societies, it is often difficult
<br />
to match systems appropriately for comparison.  Is &quot;European Society&quot; the
<br />
appropriate match for &quot;American Society&quot;?  To answer this would take
<br />
considerable thought, and work with many different variables, looking for
<br />
appropriate ones that reflect the infodynamic variables.  This raises a
<br />
deeper question as to what kind of science is being made here.  Are we in
<br />
the framework of confirmation, or of testing?  I would say, at this stage,
<br />
that we are in the stage of confirmation.  That is, we are gathering
<br />
examples that fit the model, and leaving aside those that don't.  So, in
<br />
comparing European and North American societes with different variables, we
<br />
will retain those that reflect the model.  (We would eventually need to
<br />
explain why the others did not fit the pattern.) The justification would be
<br />
that, in doing this, we are able to add society to organisms, ecosystems
<br />
and abiotic dissipative structures so as to strengthen the case for the
<br />
cogency of the model as being general.  The case is not hopeless, insofar
<br />
as ecosystems have been accepted as showing this pattern, and they present
<br />
many of the same problems of scale that societies do (see further below).
<br />
<p>Next, replying to Guy:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have a suggestion to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extending your paradigm a little.  My thoughts here are based solely on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;familiar phenomenology.  I think that major perturbations to a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can rejuvenate them.  The primary example I have in mind is the effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mass extinctions on the life history phase (sensu Salthe) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biosphere.  Another somewhat different sort of example is biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reproduction.  A new organism does not represent a completely fresh
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantiation, as in spontaneous generation.  Instead, it relies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entirely on the persistence of metabolisms from the previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generation, whether the reproduction was sexual or asexual.  I suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that this is consistent with what you had in mind when you wrote that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immature systems &quot;started as a trivial spin-off from a larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dissipative structure,&quot; but I would argue that it represents more of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuation of process than is suggested by &quot;spin-off.&quot;  In effect, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be considered a designed mechanism of large perturbation to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metabolic process of gametes/zygotes, which go from being part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parental organism, to being on their own.  The merger of fertilization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be another dramatic metabolic perturbation, although one that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;results in an increase in system size.  Have you thought about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanisms of rejuvenation and the potential for systems to incorporate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such mechanisms into their mode of existence?
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes indeed, I have been quite aware that perturbations tend to
<br />
rejuvenate systems. This is well known in ecology, especially as an
<br />
important effect of agricultural pollution on wetlands and waters of all
<br />
kinds, which results from an injection of available energy into the system,
<br />
which leads certain species to take over, simplifying the system.  In fact
<br />
I think that Guy's &quot;perturbation&quot; as a source of rejuvenation would always
<br />
tend to be accompanied by (and often triggered by) increasing energy
<br />
throughput.  This is certainly true of organismic reproduction, as
<br />
propagules aways begin with very high mass specific energy throughput,
<br />
which increases in immaurity and then drops off into senescence.  This is
<br />
found in all the kinds of dissipative structures I know of.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways that dissipative structures end their days in
<br />
senescence.  Simple ones like hurricanes and tornadoes increase in size,
<br />
overextending themselves in increasingly complicated minor swirls.  They
<br />
lose focus, become &quot;scatter brained&quot;.  In this phase hurrcanes might give
<br />
rise to tornadoes. Ecosystems, after developing into senescence, await some
<br />
rejuvenating perturbation -- fire, flood, etc. -- and then begin their
<br />
development again.  Organisms, after reproducing in maturity, get recycled
<br />
because the effects of information overload prevent them from handling
<br />
perturbations adequately.
<br />
<p>Now to Victoeras, who said:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would argue on senescence... There are systems that do not senesce: stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elementary particles, stable atoms, some molecules, hydroid colonies,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bacterial colonies (if enough space and resources are provided) are immortal
</em><br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, of course, met these examples before.  I think that the notion
<br />
that they do not senesce is due to not looking at them in a way that shows
<br />
their senescence.  First, with atoms and elementary particles we have a
<br />
severe observer problem.  We have no idea whatever whether they develop or
<br />
not.  We deal with them en masse, in such a way that indviduals are never
<br />
examined as such.  Our theories ofthem do not require that we know wether
<br />
or not they develop.  With bacteria (or any cells) I have shown that the
<br />
cell cycle can be interpreted to be a process leadng to senescence, with
<br />
cell division being a rejuvenation (as in my reply to Guy above).  This
<br />
applies of course to the cells of hydroids as well.  But, with modular
<br />
organisms like these I would further submit that in order to show
<br />
senescence we would need to show that colonies experience a slowing down of
<br />
growth rate and/or of metabolic rate.  These data are generally not
<br />
available, and without them, I submit that, once again, we do not know
<br />
whether they senesce or not.  So, in order to convince me that modular
<br />
organisms do not senesce I need to see that their growth rates do not
<br />
decline, and that their metabolic rates do not decline.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;.. However some systems must pass structural transitions after certain time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- non stable atoms during the process of radioactive decay become stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(and &quot;immortal&quot;), ecosystems too - no ecosystem die just because of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flow (although it may die because of drastically changed environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditions), it just change its structure, both species composition and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;habitat characteristics.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have commented upon this in my answer to Guy.  It is not
<br />
necessary to die as a consequence of senescence.  Ecosystems, in
<br />
particular, get rejuvenated.
