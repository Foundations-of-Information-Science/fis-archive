<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess that music has less to do with meaning as with affection or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *mood.*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In our modern rationalist and subjectivist tradition affections 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Greek: *pathe*) are seen as something *less* than rationality and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *subjective* as opposed to the so called objective and *mood-free* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science. This is, I believe, a Cartesian idealization. Human knowledge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and probably also *any kind* of knowledge of other living beings...) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is basically, as Heidegger (following Aristotle and Augustine) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stressed, *mood conditioned.* If we do not take for granted the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dichotomy between an *outside world* and an *encapsuled subjectivity* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then this thesis means that moods are not purely subjective but a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condition of world experience. We can the say, for instance, that to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience the world as something *supporting* (or *destroying* or...) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our lives makes us aware (AS *happiness*, *fear*, ...) of what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *reality* is. Also the value free experience of the world through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective science is a specific mood, a *cold* one, so to speak. Not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being the authors neither of the world nor of our lives (i.e. being, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Kantian words, &quot;intellectus ektypus&quot; or &quot;derived intellects&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrast to &quot;intellectus archetypus&quot;), our *cold* intellect comes too 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; late in order to rationalize what we could call the *vibration* of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being (this is a poetic formula, of course).
</em><br />
<p>For me, mood is simply another form of meaning.  Formally, a mood is the 
<br />
experience of a trace of experience (i.e., meaning) - it is a sign, 
<br />
coexistent with other signs of some variety.  Informally, you might 
<br />
think of it as an individuated experience &quot;smeared&quot; across our other 
<br />
experiences.
<br />
<p>Recall that I said there are two forms of meaning synthesis, formal and 
<br />
intuitive.  Mood is an intuitive synthesis and it may act as a modifier 
<br />
of formal synthesis.  Conversely, formal synthesis is a modifier of 
<br />
intuitive synthesis and in the case of &quot;mood&quot;, for example, ritual is a 
<br />
formal modifier.  But I see no reason beyond these dynamics to label a 
<br />
&quot;mood&quot; distinct from other meaning.
<br />
<p>I think it is well understood that the experience of &quot;mood&quot; is modified 
<br />
by body chemistry.  My model would predict this.  This chemistry is 
<br />
obviously changed by the things we consume.
<br />
<p>The primitive transduction instantiated by aural inputs - including 
<br />
music - causes chemistry modifications that in turn have an affect on 
<br />
our embodied traces of experience - the experience of which is meaning.  
<br />
Immersive rock music thus provides a different &quot;musical&quot; experience when 
<br />
the senses are assaulted by sound than that of a string quartet.
<br />
<p>A simple way to think about the distinction here, if this advanced forum 
<br />
will forgive me using a simplification I use in teaching it - is to 
<br />
consider formal thinking simply as experience that you can put into 
<br />
words, and intuitive thinking as experience you cannot.
<br />
<p>If you have not reviewed my materials before I should make it clear that 
<br />
in my model the primitive of experience is first-order.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I would say that we grasp a sound AS music when we perceive it as an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; echo of such &quot;vibration&quot; or as an answer to it, in case we compose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sounds giving them the quality of such a *world mood.*
</em><br />
<p>I would put it this way:  we grasp sound as music - i.e., as a 
<br />
metaphysical mark (as opposed to a natural mark such as the sound of the 
<br />
wind in the trees) - when we embody a set of definitions consistent with 
<br />
the convention that permits us to appreciate it as such.  This is not to 
<br />
say that one cannot appreciate Beethoven only if we know what music is - 
<br />
clearly a child, with no such knowledge, appears to appreciate 
<br />
Beethoven.  However, the meaning they associate with it is entirely 
<br />
intuitive - and insufficient to allow them to distinguish Beethoven as 
<br />
music from the music of birdsong or the wind in the trees.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably this is a dimension in which we can communicate with other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living beings without the direct (!) intervention of meaning and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language.
</em><br />
<p>You mean in the same sense that the gods communicate with us via the 
<br />
signs in the heavens? :) 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I very much agree with Andrei's posting concerning the &quot;impossibility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say&quot; which is another way of considering music as an 'echo' to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *vibrations* of being. I would only remark that we usually relate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; music to infinity and to God within a metaphysical perspective. We can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also consider it is a response to *finitude* which is no less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *disturbing* giving that *natality* and *mortality* are empirical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena which at the same time (!) resist to *meaning*.
</em><br />
<p>Ask yourself what made you say this.  Where did you get this notion of 
<br />
&quot;infinity&quot; from?  What do you mean by &quot;metaphysical&quot;?  What do you mean 
<br />
by &quot;God&quot;? What makes you draw a connection to &quot;music&quot;?
<br />
<p>A good friend of mine died a few weeks ago aged 39 - he had been 
<br />
apparently in good health.  In my experience of his passing I cannot say 
<br />
it &quot;resists meaning.&quot;  I could say that it left me confused intuitively 
<br />
and &quot;made no sense&quot; - but this is rhetoric.  I am confident, in fact, 
<br />
that mortality has broad meaning both intuitively and formally - for it 
<br />
is survival.
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven
