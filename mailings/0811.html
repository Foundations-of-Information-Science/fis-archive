Dear colleagues,
<br />
yes I would like to demonstrate how practical the interaction between
<br />
sequences and mixtures can be made. I'd love to get an invitation to a
<br />
seminar or for a semester or for a year or to work in a group.
<br />
<p>I am ready to accept offers of a motivational nature.
<br />
Looking forward your suggestion on this matter,
<br />
Karl

Betreff: Counting and optimization
<br />
<p>Dear Colleagues:
<br />
<p>This message responds to a number of posts (Heiner, John H., Pedro, Karl,
<br />
Christophe) over the past several weeks. In most cases I include quotes from
<br />
the author to help inform the readers of the original issue of
<br />
correspondence.
<br />
<p>Heiner Benking post of Sun, 22 Sep 2002 09:55:26 +0200 (MET DST) proposes to
<br />
bridge ...
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;the space between data and meaning by adding
<br />
some work
<br />
done in the field of terminology research. This &quot;zooming&quot; into the space
<br />
between data and meaning is made clear at:
<br />
<a href="../../benking.de/Global-Change/Con-con.gif">http://benking.de/Global-Change/Con-con.gif</a>
<br />

<br />
<a href="../../www.ceptualinstitute.com/genre/benking/term/terminology.htm">http://www.ceptualinstitute.com/genre/benking/term/terminology.htm</a>
<br />
and
<br />
<a href="../../benking.de/Global-Change/spatial-spacial.html">http://benking.de/Global-Change/spatial-spacial.html</a>
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;I do not understand how this sort of global classification solves
<br />
the problems of the information sciences. Subjective classifications are
<br />
difficult precisely because they require judgments that are controversial.
<br />
The usual approach to resolving such controversies is to count. Perhaps
<br />
Heiner would demonstrate how this &quot;zooming in&quot; process approaches Karls
<br />
commentary on counting.
<br />
<p>For example, Karl wrote on Tue, 24 Sep 2002 13:00:57 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;&quot;My contention --jumping to a theoretical
<br />
science level-- is that we have to let loose the conceptualizations
<br />
transported by our way of counting (1,2,3,...) because they carry in an
<br />
implicit way of thinking that does not agree with biological phenomena. The
<br />
ideas behind a basic assumption about the world that are implicit in
<br />
counting like 1,2,3,... seem to be:
<br />
<p>-- all elements are alike in their basic unit (there is only one kind of
<br />
basic
<br />
units),
<br />
-- the distance between elements is the same,
<br />
-- the increase from one element to the next is the same (the basic
<br />
element),
<br />
-- there is no end in sight to this series,
<br />
-- there are no preferred sizes to elements,
<br />
-- there are no two basic kinds of elements that cooperate in the generation
<br />
of a new element.&quot;
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;To what extend can Heiner's classification meet the criteria of
<br />
Karl?
<br />
<p>Pedro wrote (within his doctrine of limitation, on Fri, 27 Sep 2002 14:46:01
<br />

<br />
<p>&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;The neuronal information processing
<br />
capabilities are built exclusively upon cellular building blocks that
<br />
continuously instantiate their signaling abilities. The cellular use of
<br />
electric fields becomes a prolongation of the transgenerational processing
<br />
of genomes, both mapping into terribly different time scales, material
<br />
substrates and 'topological' processes the overall fitness of the organism.
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;Karl prefers to relate to the issues raised by Pedro by iterating
<br />
his views on partitioning [Wed, 9 Oct 2002 14:32:27 +0200 (MET DST)]:
<br />
<p>&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;My hypothesis is that (his) { &quot;his&quot; refers to
<br />
another reference, not Pedro} type of simple partitional exercise, reminding
<br />
a random walk, may serve quite well for making sense of the interactions
<br />
between the atomic components (how neutrons, protons and electrons may add
<br />
up to compose the multi-dimensional atomic truth table).
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;Perhaps, Karl, you would clarify your ideas by demonstrating such a
<br />
truth table? Biological organization generates exponential functions, not
<br />
merely addition, does it not?
<br />
<p>In response to my question,
<br />
&lt;Does the concept of information depend on communication?
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;John Holgate &lt;?/color&gt;replies on Thu, 3 Oct
<br />
2002 09:42:36 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
&lt;?fontfamily&gt;&lt;?param Arial&gt;&lt;?smaller&gt;That's the big question, isn't it?
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;What we really need is a solid theory of
<br />
'agency' and mediated interaction.
<br />
(both Goranson and Fuchs come at agency from different angles in their
<br />
papers).
<br />
<p>Coeira's 'Mediated Agent Interaction' might be of interest
<br />
&lt;?/color&gt;&lt;<a href="../../www.coiera.com/papers/AIME-01.pdf">http://www.coiera.com/papers/AIME-01.pdf</a>&gt;&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param
<br />
0000,0000,FFFF&gt;<a href="../../www.coiera.com/papers/AIME-01.pdf">http://www.coiera.com/papers/AIME-01.pdf</a>
<br />
It looks at the contextual constraint of 'common ground' .
<br />
&lt;?/color&gt;&lt;?/smaller&gt;&lt;?/fontfamily&gt;John: Thank you for the reference. This
<br />
paper is well worth the time. The author clearly distinguishes between the
<br />
concept of transmission and mere translation. This distinction deserves
<br />
wider attention, especially in relation to the meaning of information.
<br />
Shannon information is &quot;freely&quot; translatable among different computer
<br />
systems (no deep conceptual problems, but lots of practical technical
<br />
problems.)
<br />
<p>Pedro follows the doctrine of limitations, recognizing the cost of
<br />
partitioning Fri, 4 Oct 2002 15:13:32 +0200 (MET DST)
<br />
<p>&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;&quot;The biggest cost is related to the painful
<br />
process of 'decomposing' the big global problem into very small ones
<br />
addressed towards a population of thousands of 'limited' specialized
<br />
scientists and engineers.&quot;
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;In mathematics, a general formula for partitioning has been
<br />
available for several decades. I have never seen this formula for
<br />
partitioning cited by a biologist or a physician. Is this because the
<br />
fundamental problem of communication is not merely dividing the whole into
<br />
the sum of its parts?
<br />
<p>Pedro continues:
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;Finally, the discussions we are having on a
<br />
non-mechanistic conceptualization of info, may have some intriguing
<br />
connection with that very social-cognitive problem --How sciences working as
<br />
a collective nervous system may throw 'anticipatory light' to overcome the
<br />
impending menaces upon our planetary survival? In other words, we need to
<br />
develop 'the art of socially playing with the Rubik cube of knowledge'. Our
<br />
knowledge system has devoted countless scientific-philosophical energies to
<br />
discussions on reductionism and the like, an almost nothing to
<br />
'integrationism', 'perspectivism', 'limitation', etc. A mature info
<br />
perspective (or science) could help, and should help, to readdress the
<br />
cognitive imbalance.
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;The metaphor of &quot;the Rubik cube of knowledge&quot; is delightful!
<br />
<p>On a deeper level, Pedro brings to mind the extensive work of Herbert Simon,
<br />
The Sciences of the Artificial, etc. Simon introduces the concept of
<br />
&quot;satisfactory and sufficient&quot; in place of optimization. The long history of
<br />
&quot;optimization&quot; in engineering and mathematical theory suggest that the term
<br />
will bring substantial confusion if used with respect to the dynamics of the
<br />
CNS.
<br />
<p>In response to my question:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you provide an example of an MGS that produces meaningless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Christophe responds on Wed, 9 Oct 2002 22:58:03 +0200 (MET DST):
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;It is the purpose of a MGS to produce a
<br />
meaningful information
<br />
that will allow action implementation for the satisfaction of the
<br />
constraint S of the MGS. So it is not in the function of a MGS to
<br />
produce meaningless information.
<br />
It is to be noted also that action implementation can take place
<br />
only in locations where the constraint S exists.
<br />
We can call these locations &quot;Domain of Efficiency S&quot;. So a
<br />
meaningful (S) information can be efficient (S) or not, depending
<br />
if it is located in the Domain of Efficiency S or not.
<br />
In brief, a MGS produces only meaningful information, but these
<br />
meanings can be efficient or not. (if you want to know more on
<br />
this, see I.3 in <a href="../../www.theory-meaning.fr.st/default.htm">http://www.theory-meaning.fr.st/</a>).
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;The cultural difference between engineering and biology emerges in
<br />
this response. In the &quot;Sciences of the Artificial&quot;, human ingenuity
<br />
construct systems that are then put into motion. Biological systems simply
<br />
run on internal sources of motion; the constraints are the organism itself.
<br />
Ultimately, the &quot;information&quot; suffices for either life or death. Should the
<br />
notion of &quot;constraints&quot; be viewed as a physical metaphor for biology and
<br />
medicine?
<br />
<p>In response to my question:
<br />
<p>&quot;Karl: Is chemical and biochemical counting sufficiently complex to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;address your concerns about the nature of counting in FIS? Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correspondence with chemical counting a necessity for biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counting?&quot;
</em><br />
<p>Karl responds (Wed, 9 Oct 2002 14:32:27 +0200 (MET DST))
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;In my opinion, the entries in the periodic
<br />
table of elements by Mendeleiev can well be regarded as entries into a
<br />
multi-dimensional truth table. Now, which kind is the truth question to
<br />
which these answers yield always .t. (true)?
<br />
<p>We presently have reason to assume that there exist about 104
<br />
distinguishable kinds of logical .t. values, which are to be splitted up
<br />
into some several hundred varieties, as each entry may have from 1 up to
<br />
some dozen of equivalent forms (what the physicists call &quot;isotopes&quot;). The
<br />
roughly 100 main archetypes of logical truths are subject to a manifold of
<br />
logical relations. (there are some that cannot be present both at the same
<br />
time--but it is another separate discussion).
<br />
<p>The entries into the above truth table have an intrinsic ordering principle
<br />
which does not adhere strictly to their &quot;weight&quot;. This would be like saying
<br />
that some subsets are similar to each other irrespective of their
<br />
cardinality. Also, their building grammar appears to start at integer values
<br />
of n=2i**2, with i = 1,2,3,... One may want to look into the generating
<br />
function:
<br />
<p>Function m(n); local integer tmp, first, len, zero, m; tmp = int(sqrt(n/2));
<br />
first = 2*tmp**2; len = 4*tmp + 2; zero = if(n-first &lt; len/2, first + tmp,
<br />
first + len/2 + tmp); m = n - zero; return(m).
<br />
which gives one a &quot;long&quot; periodicity starting off at values of n=2i**2, with
<br />
half-periodicities included.
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;Truth tables can be constructed for logical propositions and for
<br />
first order logic and for higher order logics. I do not understand the
<br />
reason for focusing on the concept of logical truth table in this context.
<br />
Chemistry and biology are experimental sciences; only limited abstraction is
<br />
possible. How does one relate the truth table values of chemical
<br />
propositions to communication? The experimental observations of chemical
<br />
compounds are constructions from the elements, *not* partitioning of the
<br />
elements.
<br />
<p>Karl, while I agree that generating functions are critical to mathematics,
<br />
how does one move from the mathematical concept of a generating function to
<br />
communication? Do you intend that the &quot;psuedo - code&quot; you include in your
<br />
message should be given meaning in terms of chemical structures, such a
<br />
neural transmitters?
<br />
<p>The following paragraphs:
<br />
&lt;?color&gt;&lt;?param 0000,0000,FFFF&gt;In drawing-of-samples it helps to add to the
<br />
Gauss distribution the Euler distribution which is hugely asymmetric. In my
<br />
opinion, the Euler distribution is far more important than the Gauss one.
<br />
With it, one finds a
<br />
extremely useful connection between &quot;size-of-set&quot;, &quot;number-of-chunks&quot; and
<br />
&quot;size-of-chunk&quot;. (And of course also the other two ways around, too.) The
<br />
Euler distribution is very simple and elegant, although shamefully
<br />
neglected. Just chart the number of partitions into k summands for each n (1
<br />
graph per each number, k horizontally, f vertically) and then integrate with
<br />
n -&gt; inf.
<br />
<p>Then, to speculate on whether there is a material 'constant' of which these
<br />
logical chemical archetypes are built up (the second question we are trying
<br />
to answer), one needs to generate the .2. set of partitions. Those for which
<br />
sum(m(ni))=m(n). On these, one may start adding pairwise: those that fall
<br />
down where .3. holds true, these converge. One does not know whether the
<br />
left or the right half-periodicity is the right one and they differ ever so
<br />
slightly. My hypothesis is that his type of simple partitional exercise,
<br />
reminding a random walk, may serve quite well for making sense of the
<br />
interactions between the atomic components (how neutrons, protons and
<br />
electrons may add up to compose the multi-dimensional atomic truth table).
<br />
<p>&lt;?/color&gt;are not understandable to me. The system under discussion, the
<br />
domain of discourse is not stated as it relates to communication. I suspect
<br />
that the basic presupposition is that communication is merely a statistical
<br />
abstraction. How does one read the notation: .2. and .3. with respect to
<br />
conjunctions and disjunctions of propositions or first order statements? Is
<br />
the discourse related to marketing consumer products? Biochemically,
<br />
biological communication demonstrates both specificity and sensitivity. The
<br />
issues of Gaussian vs Eulerian distributions seldom arises.
<br />
<p>This post is rather long. Individual respondents may hope to find some
<br />
relationships among my ordering of the responses.
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
<p>Jerry
