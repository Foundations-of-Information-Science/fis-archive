Dear Sergio, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I am sorry if I upset you with my example of Dutch tomatoes. But this
<br />
&quot;ecological niche&quot; seems rather viable despite the lack of sunshine in
<br />
this country. My point was about the construction of ecological niches
<br />
which can be sustained for shorter or longer periods of time. For
<br />
example, the polder landscape in Holland is now sustainable for more
<br />
than a few centuries. (My house, for example, is at six meters below the
<br />
normal sea level.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
One can always question an assumption used as relevant for the
<br />
construction of a social system and then show that it is not sustainable
<br />
at a longer-term perspective. The question is the sustainability of the
<br />
ecological niches in which we live. These are constructs which can be
<br />
reconstructed. When a dimension is added to the reconstruction all bets
<br />
on the basis of the previous system are off because a dimension is added
<br />
to the system. The maximum entropy is then multiplied. This
<br />
consideration explains why high-tech systems are often better
<br />
sustainable than low-tech ones. The tomato example illustrates the
<br />
point. The eco-tax of the EU did not help the natural tomatos. One may
<br />
regret this, but this is not incidental. There is no alternative to
<br />
knowledge-based innovations.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With kind regards, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

Subject: [Fis] Again about coupling resources and information
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Dear FIS Colleagues,
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Sorry for not replying in the last week, due to real overload for other
<br />
commitments. Let me try to say something about the &quot;value&quot; problem
<br />
raised in several recent postings. In so doing, I also would like to
<br />
remove some misunderstandings about my last message. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>a) Pedro quotes one sencence from my message out of the right context
<br />
(&quot;seeds, money, DNA, books, software, religions, cities, database, have
<br />
no hope to last, reproduce, or even survive against the law of entropy,
<br />
if resource flows are not provided every day to counter their
<br />
degradation.&quot;) and says that it implies hard-core reductionism. He makes
<br />
me to say something that I never said (the need for entropy analysis of
<br />
DNA or of seeds!) and then states that this is wrong.I agree, of
<br />
course.In fact I never said this. I said something that is much more
<br />
different and that Luis clearly summarizes in his posting: whatever we
<br />
do (be it making a house, teaching or thinking) we need resources:
<br />
building material, energy, food, water, electricity to power our
<br />
computer, energy and resources to keep the whole University system
<br />
working. Due to the entropy degradation, further maintenance is needed
<br />
at the expenses of additional resources. Making and disseminating copies
<br />
of the achieved information is the strategy that ecosystems as well as
<br />
humans follow (1) to avoid information losses, (2) to make it tested by
<br />
&quot;trial and error&quot; processes and (3) to move on to the new information
<br />
levels or dimensions pointed out by Loet. Resources and energy are a
<br />
pre-requisite for any of such activities (Enzo underlines this very
<br />
clearly in his message; Luis correctly talks about &quot;energy that we have
<br />
available for a sustainable development&quot;). These resources can be
<br />
misused or even lead to the creation of Leonardo's &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;: the
<br />
quality of the result (we may say: its information content) is not
<br />
directly proportional to the input of resources, nor these two aspects
<br />
appear to be linked in any quantifiable way (although a qualitative link
<br />
cannot be denied). Yet, no resources, no result (no information). The
<br />
sun generates information via the photosynthetic process (sometimes we
<br />
talk of a flow of negentropy from the sun). The following steps (i.e.
<br />
the ways and the extent of biodiversity generation) cannot be easily
<br />
linked to the amount of solar negenergy, since they depend on the
<br />
evolution process, where several other factors affect the system (e.g.
<br />
scarcity of nutrients, chaotic fluctuations of any environmental
<br />
parameters, choices). Yet, again, no solar radiation, no photosynthesis,
<br />
no further steps.To point out that material and energy resources are a
<br />
pre-requisite does not mean to claim that we are able to &quot;force&quot; the
<br />
evolutionary process and drive it where we like. It only means that
<br />
resources are important and that their good use and conservation are of
<br />
primary importance for future development. Everybody knows that some
<br />
resources can be replaced by others, but this is not true for every
<br />
resource, nor it is true for the solar radiation. Even if the &quot;stone age
<br />
did not end for lack of stones&quot;, our sustainability may be significantly
<br />
affected by lack of primary resources or by the disruption of the
<br />
environmental context (another kind of resource) in which our activities
<br />
develop (&quot;Supply-Side Sustainability&quot;, Allen, Tainter and Hoekstra,
<br />
2002). 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>b) Pavel refers to me by saying that &quot;basic analysis of energy flows and
<br />
&quot;stocks&quot; tells very little about information content of the system&quot;. I
<br />
agree. In fact I never said that we know the information content of
<br />
something by knowing its energy content.The information content of
<br />
something is so hard to explore and describe, that even thinking of its
<br />
quantification is almost impossible.  The problem here is that energy
<br />
analysis is a First Law method, while Exergy and Emergy analyses are
<br />
Second Law-based and take into account the entropy generation occurring
<br />
when a resource is generated (emergy) or used (exergy). This is not
<br />
without interesting consequences.
<br />
<p>Exergy (&quot;the amount of work obtainable when some matter is brought to a
<br />
state of thermodynamic equilibrium with the common components of the
<br />
natural surroundings by means of reversible processes, involving
<br />
interaction only with the above mentioned components of nature&quot;, Szargut
<br />
et al., 1988) measures the physical and chemical &quot;information&quot; of an
<br />
item in relation to its conversion into useful work (mechanical,
<br />
electric, etc). Since exergy refers to reversible processes (and real
<br />
processes are never reversible), it states very clearly an upper limit
<br />
to the work obtainable and allows a sustainability assessment mainly
<br />
focussing on the way resources are used and on what can be obtained from
<br />
them (i.e. an user-side sustainability). Of course, we are not talking
<br />
here of the exergy of a person or a standing tree, since exergy is not
<br />
sensitive to life (using Luis' words). Herefore, we do not use exergy to
<br />
measure the work of an artist or the complexity of a flower or fruit (as
<br />
Enzo also pointed out).
<br />
<p>As far as emergy is concerned, I would like to clarify that emergy is
<br />
not energy. It is the memory of the resources previously used up in a
<br />
process (by the way, measured in exergy terms_ Odum, Environmental
<br />
Accounting, 1996) during the whole pathway from primary inputs to the
<br />
final product. By measuring input flows by means of their exergy
<br />
content, emergy calculations acquire a &quot;built-in&quot; ability to account for
<br />
local scale entropy production. In addition, by integrating exergy
<br />
inputs over time and space for the calculation of transformities,
<br />
natural trial-and-error processes are also considered, thus taking into
<br />
account the production of entropy during the &quot;metabolic&quot; processes
<br />
leading to the final product via a set of intermediate steps. Therefore,
<br />
by converting all inputs into only one form unit (e.g. solar equivalent
<br />
joules), by means of suitable conversion coefficients, we measure the
<br />
(sometimes very approximate) environmental support that is required for
<br />
a process to occur. Since the ultimate sources of resources are
<br />
flow-limited (solar, deep heat, gravitational potential), the higher the
<br />
support demand, the less renewable the product. In some a way, this is a
<br />
measure of source-side sustainability. Edgar suggests in his posting
<br />
that the &quot;virtual&quot; replacement of non-renewable resources has a cost
<br />
which could be measured in exergy terms.
<br />
<p>Source-side sustainability and user-side sustainability are useful
<br />
categories to better understand a process dynamics in terms of upstream
<br />
and downstream flows. They are NOT, however, deterministic measures of
<br />
what will happen within the system thanks to the resources supplied to
<br />
it. The system reacts in many different unpredictable ways to the
<br />
resource flows and some of these ways will be selected by the natural
<br />
selection. 
<br />
<p>Luis is right when he underlines the need for a further effort to find a
<br />
measure of the organizational level of an ecosystem also in relation to
<br />
life. Unfortunately, measuring what already happened and what is
<br />
presently happening is relatively easy, while predictions are quite
<br />
difficult and maybe impossible. Sven Jorgensen, University of
<br />
Copenhagen, made interesting steps ahead towards assessing and modelling
<br />
the level of organization of an ecosystem, by also including &quot;Shannon&quot;
<br />
estimates of species diversity. His goal-function is also called exergy,
<br />
but maybe it should be given a different name.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;
<br />
<p>Let's now turn to Loet's Dutch tomatoes: what he says is simply
<br />
impossible. Photosynthesis cannot occur without solar radiation.
<br />
Replacing the sun by means of electric light is in principle possible
<br />
(the growth of plants under artificial light has been already
<br />
investigated), but would require a tremendous input of fossil fuels to
<br />
power the electric plant and a consequent related atmospheric pollution.
<br />
In general, greenhouse tomatoes in cold climates require a greenhouse
<br />
(plastics or glass, concrete and structure metals), an artificial
<br />
substrate (such as rock wool), fertilizers, several added chemicals as
<br />
pesticides and micronutriens, and a huge heat from fossil fuels. It is
<br />
completely unsustainable from a resource availability and environmental
<br />
constraint point of view. There are several studies on this topic, from
<br />
which it can be clearly inferred that the economic sustainability of
<br />
this practice only relies on the existence of cheap fossil fuels as well
<br />
as on neglecting the environmental aspects of their use (contribution to
<br />
the greenhouse effect increase, among other problems). In addition,
<br />
greenhouse tomatoes represent a simplified ecosystem and a significant
<br />
loss of biodiversity, since they are selected to fit greenhouse
<br />
conditions and survive in a very artificial atmosphere. I already
<br />
pointed out this kind of contradiction when Loet claimed that we can
<br />
have plenty of paper, ignoring the constraints imposed by the huge
<br />
(source and sink side) environmental problems generated by paper
<br />
production. This is what generally happens when we ignore the physical
<br />
constraints within which all our actions are embedded. Adding new
<br />
dimensions has a resource and environmental cost and resources are very
<br />
often non-renewable, no matter how we measure them. Greenhouse tomatoes
<br />
cannot be considered a sustainable new dimension. 
<br />
<p>If we care the development of information and the growth of sustainable
<br />
systems able to generate and maintain information, we must pay a huge
<br />
attention to our resource basis. Ecosystems do not grow without
<br />
resources, Universities decline when funding is not appropriate,
<br />
economies and Empires collapse and are replaced by competing systems
<br />
when their resource basis shrinks.
