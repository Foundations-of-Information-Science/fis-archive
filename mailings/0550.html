In reply to John Holgate, who wrote:
<br />
<p>&quot;Is your theory equally valid for the domain of human emotions?
<br />
<p>Please excuse this perslifage but it might illustrate my point :&gt;
<br />
<p>'A date is what I refer to as a brief relationship. It is a
<br />
relationships set up
<br />
between one mass (XX) and another mass (XY), where the energy from XY
<br />
enters the
<br />
field of the energy/mass of XX. This brief contact is a date, highly
<br />
charged, in present time (brief), highly entropic. Will it be accepted
<br />
in full? Rejected in full? Accepted in part? If accepted in part (and
<br />
it's never ever accepted in full!)...then, the courtship system will
<br />
transform
<br />
it, 'interpret' it...within its own MORALITY base. As interpreted,
<br />
this energy/mass (sex/love) is now a part of XX's and XY's memory.
<br />
It is in perfect time, 'held', it is more stable.
<br />
<p>How long will they stay together before entropically dissipating?'
<br />
<p>Obviously something is lost in the translation here but I think we can
<br />
jump the divide
<br />
and compare cross-disciplinary informatory experience (which includes,
<br />
say, both protein
<br />
binding and psychological 'binding') but I am not convinced that the
<br />
environment
<br />
(or even the system) is making the 'cut'. It is IMO made by the ghost
<br />
behind the camera
<br />
- human consciousness.
<br />
<p>Any comments&quot;
<br />
<p>My comments are that my theories are valid within all three realsm:
<br />
the physico-chemical, the biological and the socioconceptual. The
<br />
differences between the realms are in the amount of energy that each
<br />
realm can process and its speed of processing..and its methods. The
<br />
physico-chemical realm will primarily use iconic or mimetic
<br />
interactions; the biological realm adds indexical interactions which
<br />
greatly enhances both its ability to produce inert matter (ie,
<br />
stabilized energy) and enhances the speed of this process. The
<br />
socioconceptual realm has added the symbolic interaction which
<br />
processes energy very rapidly.
<br />
<p>As for the 'cuts' that establish differential gradients in
<br />
energy....which MUST be established...or there couldn't be any
<br />
interactions in the first place (ie in pure symmetry, as all the
<br />
ancients pointed out - nothing moves)...No, I don't agree that human
<br />
consciousness is the sole agent of 'cuts'.
<br />
<p>In your example of the date/brief relation - I agree with your
<br />
outline. It describes a brief sensate-data interaction. Brief sensate
<br />
interactions can be very short term and dissipative. How many people
<br />
actually can identify 'who was the robber' in an incident that lasted
<br />
less than a minute? Their interpretation is not necessarily valid.
<br />
However, you describe the interpretation of this brief date between
<br />
two individuals as an interpretation according to MORALITY (your
<br />
capitals). I'm not sure what morality implies. I would say that the
<br />
interaction is interpreted according to the continuum of experiences
<br />
of each individual and the evaluation of these experiences is a
<br />
secondary action (is this a 'good' act; is it a 'just'act?).
<br />
This process of interpretation may itself lead to no long term
<br />
memories. If it is a once-only experience, then even when interpreted
<br />
(as a brief affair, let's say)...the incident may not be retained in
<br />
the human memory.
<br />
<p>Back to the cuts. First, for one system to experience another system,
<br />
they must be differentiated into two systems. I think that's rather
<br />
obvious and can't imagine any argumentation. So- what differentiates
<br />
them? I disagree with the view that only ONE agent (the receiver's
<br />
consciousness) performs this act. In the human realm - There will be a
<br />
differentiation on at least three levels. Physico-chemical, biological
<br />
and socioconceptual. The first realm is a sensate experience of two
<br />
material realities. That's beyond the capacity of human consciousness
<br />
to control. The material body will pick up the radiant energy from
<br />
another material body. Equally, biologically, there must be
<br />
interactions - a realm of sensate experience that our science is only
<br />
now working on. But I can, for example, be affected by viruses without
<br />
being conscious of it. So- the cuts are there; and are basic; and are
<br />
not due to any individual consciousness. As for human emotions, I
<br />
think there aer several stages in interpretation.
<br />
There is an internal 'immediate interpretant'. This is a phase of
<br />
acknowledgement that &quot;I am affected by something out there&quot;. That's as
<br />
far as it goes.
<br />
Then..there is the 'articulated consciousness' of this interaction. An
<br />
external 'dynamic interpretant' phase, which is where I can say &quot; What
<br />
affected me was a feeling of love and attraction to X'. Now, the
<br />
individual 'focus' has locked in. The individual as an entity can lock
<br />
onto another entity and state that 'the interaction between us is
<br />
'defined as ABC'.
<br />
<p>There is a further conscious articulation of this interaction, which
<br />
will analyze and judge the interaction, and come up with a 'final
<br />
conclusion' that 'this interaction that we have, which is love, is not
<br />
a long-term constructive situation and must be ended.  That is, this
<br />
final phase makes a judgement, while the Dynamic Interpretant phase
<br />
makes a Description. And the internal Immediate Interpretant phase
<br />
merely acknowledges the identity of the interaction.
<br />
<p>Human consciousness is not a ghost! It's part of that third type of
<br />
semiosic reality - the socioconceptual!
