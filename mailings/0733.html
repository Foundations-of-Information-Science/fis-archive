&nbsp;&nbsp;EU leads pledge to set goals for renewable energy
<br />
<p>Paul Brown and John Vidal in Johannesburg
<br />
<p>Earth summit's weak words spark 30-nation revolt
<br />
<p>Dismay at the weakness of the Earth summit's outcome spilled into the 
<br />
final plenary session in Johannesburg last week when European Union 
<br />
delegates led a protest against the failure to agree global targets 
<br />
for increasing renewable energy production.
<br />
<p>The leaders of more than 30 government delegations promised to go 
<br />
further than the summit declaration that renewable energy's share of 
<br />
global energy production should rise. They agreed to conduct regular 
<br />
reviews of progress towards ambitious targets at the national, 
<br />
regional and &quot;hopefully at a global level&quot;.
<br />
<p>&quot;Such targets are important tools to guide investment and develop the 
<br />
market for renewable energy technologies,&quot; their statement said. 
<br />
Support came from all 15 EU states, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, 
<br />
Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Brazil, 
<br />
Argentina, Uganda, Mexico, and other Latin American, Caribbean and 
<br />
Pacific states.
<br />
<p>America's isolation on countering climate change was further 
<br />
underlined last week when its only remaining ally, Australia, shifted 
<br />
ground. The prime minister, John Howard, who had insisted that 
<br />
Australia would not ratify the Kyoto protocol to cut greenhouse gas 
<br />
emissions, said he would reconsider its position.
<br />
<p>Another last-minute change was the restoration of a clause on human 
<br />
rights whose original wording was resisted by the US, the Vatican and 
<br />
Islamic states. At their insistence the clause omitted the right of 
<br />
women to contraception and abortion, and hailed the superiority of 
<br />
local cultural and religious values. The US stepped back when it was 
<br />
pointed out that the clause would give tacit approval to such widely 
<br />
condemned local traditions as genital mutilation.
<br />
<p>An attempt by the US to dilute provisions on corporate accountability 
<br />
and regulation was rejected, after objections by Ethiopia and Norway.
<br />
<p>The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, was jeered and slow 
<br />
handclapped during his speech. A wave of anti-American feeling was 
<br />
unleashed when he blamed the land reforms of Zimbabwe's president, 
<br />
Robert Mugabe, for pushing millions of people &quot;to the brink of 
<br />
starvation&quot;.
<br />
<p>After long wrangling, agreement was finally reached on the political 
<br />
text for the summit, originally written by the conference chairman, 
<br />
the South African president Thabo Mbeki, which was also tough in the 
<br />
area of corporate accountability. This was seen as a victory for 
<br />
environmental groups in their campaign to curb the power of 
<br />
multinationals. But these groups remained angry that so few targets 
<br />
and timetables for action reached the final text. NGOs said that, 
<br />
although the summit's action plan agreed to move towards phasing out 
<br />
export subsidies, the world's governments had failed to grasp the 
<br />
urgency of opening up agricultural markets to developing countries.
