Dear All,
<br />
<p>Continuing with the other issues currently discussed, a nasty problem 
<br />
around the necessary reductionism / integrationism complementarity revolves 
<br />
in that while the former is bolstered by a very long tradition and a very 
<br />
robust methodology, as John H has nicely put, the latter has suffered all 
<br />
kind of misunderstandings and misconstructions (either caught in the 
<br />
strictures of atheoretical pragmatism or directly in the hands of 
<br />
pseudo-science). Integration is not just the opposite of reduction, but it 
<br />
may be taken as another denomination for the untractable mutidisciplinary / 
<br />
consilience problem. Several parties in this list have advocated systemic 
<br />
views (Stan a number of times!, Jerry also produced a vast systemic 
<br />
scheme). However, arguing seriously about systems theory, after the 
<br />
pioneering views of von Bertalanffy in the 60's, very little has been 
<br />
produced under the guidance of that school, and I really contend that, 
<br />
concerning the integration problem, anything but triviality and 
<br />
self-delusion can be found around the 'level' stuff nowadays.
<br />
<p>The lack of appropriate metaphors to be handled in front of the apparent 
<br />
naturality of the mechanistic and also of the &quot;systemic&quot; or &quot;holistic&quot; 
<br />
complex of thought (composition and decomposition by manual operations upon 
<br />
objects and their parts) is part of the missing informational 
<br />
conceptualization too. So, discussing in depth the series of bio-economic 
<br />
metaphors raised by Aleks would be quite interesting (impossible here, but 
<br />
just as a detail, the ATP is presented as 'currency' in most textbooks: 
<br />
wrong, at is just pure 'fuel'; the only cellular currency may be 
<br />
established around &quot;second messengers&quot; cAMP, Ca++, cGMP, etc.). In general 
<br />
I accept the difficulty on pointing at any clear-and-cut info metaphor to 
<br />
be presented as an alternative to those seductive images from reductionism 
<br />
&amp; mechanism and pseudo-holism... Shouldn't we plan some devoted work on 
<br />
advancing in this metaphorical aspect too?
<br />
<p>Finally, my past message trying to &quot;nail&quot; down a metaphor on value within 
<br />
social networks, may be formulated more succinctly as follows: when the 
<br />
social value of some object gets &quot;measured&quot; as a price, what we 
<br />
collectively perform is an estimation of the capability of that object to 
<br />
promote &quot;formation of social structures&quot; around itself... Perhaps sort of a 
<br />
middle road between Bob's and Karl's views (could multidimensional 
<br />
partitions as descriptors of social nets complexity provide a complement to 
<br />
the current conceptualization of ascendancy?). Then, a pressing issue to 
<br />
consider in this tentative revision of social ascendancy may be that social 
<br />
information is very largely &quot;decoupled&quot; from entropy growth (as biological 
<br />
information itself). An additional problem concerning Karl's partitional 
<br />
approach is that he has not developed a consistent methodology yet---and 
<br />
the attempts made by me and Morris a few years ago, produced contradictory 
<br />
results with him. So I friendly depart from his views when he heuristically 
<br />
establishes the number of multidimensional partitions.
<br />
<p>Today seems to be my disagreement day: Lots of stuff to discuss in Paris!
<br />
<p>regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Very cordial acknowledgements to Michel for his great organizing work.
