<p>
The following are my thoughts after the recent internalism session of fis,
<br />
just completed.  They were formulated after re-reading the various postings
<br />
-- and, of course, they reflect my own point of view.
<br />
<p>I begin by noting the standard scientific viewpoint on the world -- the
<br />
dichotomy between a system and its environment, both seen as from outside
<br />
by a 'third person', giving us an 'epistemological cut'  The system may be
<br />
viewed as a' black box' in interaction with others, or it may be opened up
<br />
so that we can look inside, and describe it as a smaller environment for
<br />
its components and constituents. (Here we have the basis of the scale
<br />
hierarchy perspective.)
<br />
<p>Some of our members have taken internalism to be discourse about the
<br />
contents of black boxes, discussing them just as one would do with a
<br />
(larger) system of black boxes in their environment.  But this is all from
<br />
an externalist perspective.  Such discourse invariably takes place in a
<br />
global present tense, often translated into equations describing
<br />
relationships and dynamics, and this emphasizes that the behaviors
<br />
described contain no surprises; nothing new is generated within the
<br />
externalist perspective once a model has been well corroborated by
<br />
observations.  Before and after are equally well known, given the bounding
<br />
and initial conditions.  And a system is described as if it can be assessed
<br />
simultaneously at any locales whatever from a third one. This is positive
<br />
knowledge.
<br />
<p>What, then, is internalism?  At present it is the attempt to model a system
<br />
as if from inside.  We might do this with the Universe, for example, taking
<br />
as an important clue the finite speed of light, which would in fact prevent
<br />
simultaneous communication between distant locales.  But, in fact,
<br />
cosmology and cosmogony are carried on 'as if' we were outside the
<br />
Universe, looking at it as a third person -- even watching light
<br />
trajectories creating 'event horizons' for its inhabitants in different
<br />
locales at the same time.
<br />
<p>Internalist approaches involve removing certain constraints, including, e.g.,
<br />
(1) Global simultaneity is dropped.  The world is sticky, all communication
<br />
is lagged.
<br />
(2) Globality itself is dropped; actions take place at locales which are no
<br />
longer constrained by 'cosmological principles' -- boundary conditions are
<br />
all unique, and so events can lead to surprising turns.  Nonequilibrium
<br />
situations can be considered.
<br />
(3) Contingencies are not all corralled by statistics, and so produce
<br />
individuation / evolution.  Because of this, kinds of entities no longer
<br />
remain uniform, and this can impinge upon dynamics.
<br />
(4) Description is no longer restricted to the third person's present
<br />
tense.  Action, for example, is taking place in present progressive time.
<br />
<p>But all of this could be envisioned externally.  And, indeed, current
<br />
internalist discourse is done using tried and true externalist discourse.
<br />
Still, the picture generated is very different from the traditional
<br />
scientific one.  We are at a locale.  There is no inside / outside
<br />
dichotomy.  The system senses changing pressures, resistances and
<br />
affordances (but does not infer a boundary; there is no epistemological
<br />
cut) impinging upon its habits and tendencies, and it reports in present
<br />
progressive tense as it manipulates its felt situation in order to make a
<br />
next move -- which cannot be deferred or the world would come apart.  [The
<br />
brain (not the mind) of a player in a fast competitive game like hockey is
<br />
in a state, perhaps, somewhat like this.]  There are in this picture no
<br />
details that would reveal it as a particular kind of system -- the
<br />
internalist predicament is universal.  A tornado and an amoeba and a human
<br />
being are all in the same situation.  The classical universality of
<br />
objective observation is replaced by a subjective universality of
<br />
situation.  Positions at coordinates, distances, momenta and rates, growth
<br />
and stages of development are all absent, and comparisons are
<br />
inconceivable.  Acceleration might be inferred from impetus, but there is
<br />
no commensurability between externalist and internalist reports.  It might
<br />
be that the situation within a quantum wave function would be something
<br />
like this, and, perhaps that is where science first encountered
<br />
internalism.  The meditative state of mind, discovered long ago, is
<br />
somewhat similar except that it is quiescent, while the internalist
<br />
situation is endlessly active.
<br />
<p>Finally, this description using classical discourse is unsatisfactory, and
<br />
does not allow for any change whatever.  It is my intuition that a logic of
<br />
vagueness will need to be developed before internalism can become a
<br />
bonafide discourse on its own, giving results that might have some use.
<br />
Vagueness is an unstable condition, and is always being reduced to a more
<br />
definite condition.  Based on this, one might envision the development of a
<br />
locale from a primal vagueness toward an ever more definite embodiment,
<br />
perhaps passing through stages recognizable as equivalents to tornadoes,
<br />
and on into organismic condition, but, since this process would be
<br />
generative, we could not know what might evolve.  That is, the internalist
<br />
condition would be a starting point, with many possible conditions to be
<br />
generated out of it.
<br />
<p>I realize that in this summary of my impressions I may have departed from
<br />
Koichiro's understanding of internalism, and this gloss should not be taken
<br />
as representing his views fully (or accurately).
<br />
<p>I have been making an emended transcript of the internalist session, which
<br />
may take me some time to get finished.  When it is, I will post it to list
<br />
as a pdf file.
