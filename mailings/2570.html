                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Søren,
                    <br />
                <p>Thank you comments on John\'s paper. I use this chance to distinguish my
                    <br />
                    approach to information reality and John\'s one (there are similarities,
                    <br />
                    but as I see now, there are also differences),
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear John
                    </em><br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I read your first paper. Am I right in that it basically says that&gt;:
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Information is form
                    </em><br />
                    Yes, it is. Especially good illustration is given by the pilot wave of
                    <br />
                    Bohmian mechanics. A quantum particle is guided by the information
                    <br />
                    wave, pilot wave. This wave can be considered as an information field.
                    <br />
                    David Bohm and Basil Hiley wrote about ACTIVE INFORMATION FIELD. An
                    <br />
                    interesting feature of this model is that only SHAPE of the wave
                    <br />
                    function is important, not its amplitude.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Causality is exchange of form.
                    </em><br />
                    Yes.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Form can be sufficiently described by Complexity theory.
                    </em><br />
                    In my approach not at all. I want to consider information spaces,
                    <br />
                    information geometry. I think that \&quot;reality\&quot; of matter is strongly
                    <br />
                    motivated by the presence of the well established model of space in
                    <br />
                    that matter in embedded: continuous real space. I try to find an
                    <br />
                    adequate model to put information in this space. In my model
                    <br />
                    information spaces have hierarchic structure, since information for me
                    <br />
                    is more or less a hierarchic structure. In this way I come to model of
                    <br />
                    the information space based on p-adic trees and more general ulrametric
                    <br />
                    spaces.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. This again needs - to fit in the mathematical models -an
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological &gt; basis in a random universe.
                    </em><br />
                    In my approach information universe is deterministic, randomness is
                    <br />
                    reduced to randomness of ensembles of information states.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. Further there must be some \'stuff\' in that universe.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6. This stuff must have self-interacting probabilities. I guess that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; means that the unities of this \'stuff\' must be able to interact in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal causal ways with each other including building more complex &gt;
                    </em><br />
                    structures.
                    <br />
                    Okey.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7. Information is physical information and therefore connected to and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; based on Thermodynamics.
                    </em><br />
                    Not, it would be too restricted view to information. Information is the
                    <br />
                    most fundamental structure of the universe. There are laws that
                    <br />
                    describe behavior of hierarchic strings of information. Corresponding
                    <br />
                    physical laws are just special representations of information laws.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8. The view is both deterministic and statistic in that the stuff has
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &gt; follow rigid universal laws and must in some way also be
                    </em><br />
                    constructed
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; or &gt; constrained by them to hold its own form. Then we have a perfect
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; billiard Ball universe, except for that the balls here can interact
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; through forces and form in what we call chemistry.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 9. Apart from that there is no underlying overall structure or inborn
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; goal in the universe.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10. There are no purposes of a mind-like character in the universe as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; a &gt; whole or in the parts.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;My approach: Since information and not matter is fundamental, one can
                    <br />
                    consider a variety of information fields. Some of them can be of mind-
                    <br />
                    like character. I cannot exclude that they participate even in physical
                    <br />
                    processes (which are just special forms of information processes).
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11. Chance is real unpredictability (Prigogine, Peirce).
                    </em><br />
                <p>Not at all, chance is reducible to ensemble chance. Information states
                    <br />
                    by forming ensembles produce complex probabilistic structures.
                    <br />
                    Prigogine -- I never understood him, moreover, I am not sure that was
                    <br />
                    really something done.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is so, I find it to be a consistent version of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information &gt; processing paradigm. As such it has no chance
                    </em><br />
                    whatsoever to explain
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; life &gt; as the ability to have qualia experiences and some kind of
                    </em><br />
                    free will.
                    <br />
                    As you have seen, from my previous replies your conclusion is not
                    <br />
                    applicable to my model. Qualia experiences are just special information
                    <br />
                    fields. The crucial point is that we should not try to incorporate
                    <br />
                    these fields into the physical model of space. So we should not try to
                    <br />
                    play with physical-chemical reduction of life.
                    <br />
                <p>But I agree that I cannot \&quot;explain\&quot; qualia experiences. In
                    <br />
                    fact, \&quot;explain\&quot; typically means to make reduction to physical-chemical
                    <br />
                    processes. But I think that such a reduction is impossible. Therefore,
                    <br />
                    instead of \&quot;explain\&quot;, one should be interested in constructing a new
                    <br />
                    math. model in that mind-like structures will be not less real than
                    <br />
                    material structures. Can we explain electromagnetic field? Not. But we
                    <br />
                    have a nice mathematical model, see
                    <br />

                <p>\&quot;We use the system of p-adic numbers for the description of information
                    <br />
                    processes. Basic objects of our models are so called transformers of
                    <br />
                    information, basic processes are information processes, the statistics
                    <br />
                    are information statistics (thus we present a model of information
                    <br />
                    reality). The classical and quantum mechanical formalisms on
                    <br />
                    information p-adic spaces are developed. It seems that classical and
                    <br />
                    quantum mechanical models on p-adic information spaces can be applied
                    <br />
                    for the investigation of flows of information in cognitive and social
                    <br />
                    systems, since a p-adic metric gives quite natural description of the
                    <br />
                    ability to form associations.\&quot;
