<p>
Dear Perdo,
<br />
dear all,
<br />
<p>first of all: sorry!, that I did not comment on your last email, but I 
<br />
got ill on the last weekend - and spent the rest of the week catching up 
<br />
my work.
<br />
<p>To start at your end point:
<br />
<p>I think there is a close connection between the discussion on &quot;arts and 
<br />
meaning&quot; and infoethics, since humans use information technologies to 
<br />
create meaning. So, there is also a close connection between culture and 
<br />
information technologies - and thus informationethics.
<br />
<p>When we take a look at the &quot;culture&quot;, at least the European culture is 
<br />
closely connected to an information technology called &quot;book&quot;. We can 
<br />
still see this every time, when people try to make the point, that &gt;new&lt; 
<br />
technologies threaten culture, because they question the importance of 
<br />
&quot;books&quot; (and other quality types of print media).
<br />
<p>Books have been important tools to create &quot;cultures&quot;, since they are 
<br />
seen as a tool to promote and distribute important ideas as well as 
<br />
establish these ideas within one culture. But they are also ambivalent 
<br />
because books can also be seen as a tool of discipline, which i. e. ask 
<br />
people to value certain kinds of information more than over. There are 
<br />
also a lot of myths connected to the information technology called 
<br />
&quot;book&quot;, i. E. the myth that there has to be a &quot;author&quot;, that is: a 
<br />
creative individual. These myths also make it difficult - even today - 
<br />
to accept, that &quot;books&quot; may a. o. also been seen as tools, which create 
<br />
networks, in which information is communicated not only from one author 
<br />
to her/his audience, but are tools for distributed information work. So, 
<br />
when we take a close look at the information technology &quot;book&quot; we should 
<br />
not think of the &quot;work of authors&quot;, but we should also see the 
<br />
collective effort to create true and/or meaningful texts (and pictures) 
<br />
which includes (at least) critic on published text, the reworking of 
<br />
texts, the strategies of publishers, who decide, which book is to be 
<br />
published etc. pp.
<br />
<p>This brings me to the point &gt;new technologies&lt;: When I start doing 
<br />
information ethics, I did start with the idea that &gt;new technologies&lt; 
<br />
might generate &gt;new problems&lt; with need to be reflected within ethics, 
<br />
which might lead to the finding, that we need new concepts in ethics. 
<br />
This view did change after I started my research on the history of media 
<br />
and the history of ethics, where I found that a lot of problems we face 
<br />
today in the field of &quot;information ethics&quot; were not new at all.
<br />
<p>In this time the book of Michael Giesecke (Von den Mythen der Buchkultur 
<br />
zu den Visionen der Informationsgesellschaft, 2002 - 
<br />
<a href="../../www.mythen-der-buchkultur.de/default.htm">http://www.mythen-der-buchkultur.de/</a>) turned out to helpful, since 
<br />
Giesecke explains &quot;information society&quot; as a term as self-description. 
<br />
So, the most important thing in the discussion on the &quot;information 
<br />
society&quot; (which might be in need for a new ethos) might be the fact, 
<br />
that we describe our own society as an &quot;information society&quot; (or do 
<br />
agree on the vision of a &quot;information society&quot;) and do regard 
<br />
&quot;information&quot; as an independent good equal to matter and energy. Thus we 
<br />
would like to state the difference between our present society and other 
<br />
societies (as you know: &quot;culture&quot; is used to state and describe 
<br />
differences between cultures - as Dirk Baecker puts it -, so maybe 
<br />
&quot;society&quot; is the wrong term). One of the problems on the discussion of 
<br />
the (coming) &quot;information society&quot; might be, that we focus to much on 
<br />
the &gt;new&lt; technologies while regarding the old &gt;information 
<br />
technologies&lt; as almost &gt;natural&lt; (in the sense that we do not regard 
<br />
them as technologies as all).
<br />
<p>Now, technologies do not only rely on the the hardware and software 
<br />
involved but also on the people using it. This is at least a lesson 
<br />
learned from the problem of technology transfer, which fails, when the 
<br />
people who we would like to use this technology will not use it, because 
<br />
of cultural or ethical &quot;restraints&quot;. (Please note, that in some cases, 
<br />
&quot;we&quot; are the people, others would like to use certain forms of technology.)
<br />
<p>So, using (certain forms) of (information) technology may be regarded as 
<br />
a topic of ethics. And if we take a look at some classical philosophical 
<br />
texts (i. E. Kant, Metaphysik der Sitten) we will see, that even before 
<br />
defining ourself as members of a (coming) information society, 
<br />
philosophers did write on &quot;how to use information (technologies)&quot; in the 
<br />
field of Ethics. (Some examples discussed by Kant are the use of war 
<br />
propaganda - which he rejects -, privacy and confidentiality, censorship 
<br />
etc.) From this we can see, that the so called &gt;new&lt; problems are not 
<br />
that new (even if they may have become more important to us).
<br />
<p>In my option the quest for information ethics can be seen to find a tool 
<br />
which enables us to reflect on media again, which include the new as 
<br />
well as the old information technologies, and ask ourself what it is, 
<br />
which has really changed. To reflect on the old media seems to me also 
<br />
important to understand the problems we have when discussing topics of 
<br />
information ethics with members of other cultures, since it shows that 
<br />
some of the topics we regard as evident are not easy to communicate to 
<br />
members of other cultures. &quot;Privacy&quot; is a good example for this. And 
<br />
discussing this issues through different cultures is important, because 
<br />
we are talking on technologies used world wide, by people with very 
<br />
different cultural and social backgrounds. This is becoming an important 
<br />
issue, when it comes to the &quot;ethical design&quot; of information 
<br />
technologies, because we should be aware of the fact, that our &quot;Ethics&quot; 
<br />
might not been seen as the only way of ethical thinking. I do not think 
<br />
that relativism is an option, but if the think of technologies, which 
<br />
are designed to protect certain values (like &quot;Privacy&quot;), we have to take 
<br />
in account, that these values may be regarded as products of the so 
<br />
called &quot;western tradition&quot; (and that they are not evident to members of 
<br />
other cultures).
<br />
<p>These are some of the more practical aspects of information ethics. 
<br />
There are also other problems, like how information technologies shape 
<br />
our understanding of &quot;information&quot; (and vice versa) or how ITC changed 
<br />
our way we define ourself as human beings - which we may discuss later.
<br />
<p>One important aspect regarding &quot;ethics&quot; which has changed since the time 
<br />
of Kant (to stay with the example) is the status of &quot;Ethics as Science 
<br />
of Morality&quot;. Till the beginning of the 20th Century - at least in 
<br />
Germany - &quot;Ethics&quot; was indeed regarded as a scientific activity, which 
<br />
a. O. was expected to design the fundamental rules and concepts of the 
<br />
society. (We can see this from the sad fact, that in the 19th Century 
<br />
jews and catholics could not become professors in philosophy in Germany, 
<br />
because they were regared as not being loyal to the German king and 
<br />
society.) Today, we do no longer regard &quot;Ethics&quot; (and &quot;Philosophy&quot;) as a 
<br />
discipline which is in charge to lay down the fundamental concepts of 
<br />
society - which leads to a question, I would like to ask to the members 
<br />
of the list:
<br />
<p>- What is the role of &quot;Ethics&quot; today? (And what role ought &quot;Ethics&quot; be 
<br />
allowed play?)
<br />
<p>Can we still regard it as &quot;Science of Morality&quot;? Or is Ethics an old 
<br />
fashioned dinosaur, which we should allow to die, since today we have 
<br />
better ways to do research on &quot;Morality&quot; (like psychology or neuro-science)?
<br />
<p>Or is the task of Ethics to remind us to the fact, that there are 
<br />
&quot;irreducible&quot; residues of the common good which have not been detected 
<br />
by those other formal grids (as stated in the email by Pedro Marijuan)? 
<br />
If this is the case, may &quot;art&quot; not be the better in fulfilling this task?
<br />
<p>With best regards,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Should we keep discussing the Prolegomena on info &amp; ethics or should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we jump into the concrete questions about the contemporary revolution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of info technologies? Apologies for being focused again in the former, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hopefully it will help to produce more interesting answers about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If ethics is related to a collective dimension of an individual's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;fitness&quot;  (within a complex society), and if we suppose that fitness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself is amenable to formal/informational treatments (or will be in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foreseeable future), it seems difficult not to conclude on some form 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of informational reductionism on ethics. However, I feel in a strong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreement with that apparent reductionist conclusion derived from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own responses to the opening text. So, let me backtrack.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a complex society, any individual's action may be subject to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scrutiny on very different grounds: say as immoral, unprofitable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (non-economic), unjust, unethical...  The &quot;moral&quot; ground is usually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understood as very close to the core of human condition, related to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human nature itself (that &quot;zoe&quot; pointed out by Rafael), and then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understood slightly different from the classical view in philosophy. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Religions have been the traditional providers of the moral sense in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost every society: eg, the very clear ruling in the Ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Commandments of Christianity. Going to the &quot;economic&quot; ground, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly regimented and abstract, wrapped in strict accounting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; procedures (curiously related to the historical origins of numbers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algebra, symmetry...) and purports a high level of formal abstraction, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notwithstanding its apparent immediateness. Then the &quot;legal system&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears as another grid, formally structured too, which attempts to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make a procedural &quot;map&quot; of almost any human action, particularly in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the situations amenable to conflict.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ethics would be different. Ethics implies the realization that none of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the previous grids to map human action has fulfilled its mission 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; globally, in achieving a &quot;total&quot; vision of the social behavior of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person. Some concrete actions of a person may be moral, profitable, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and legal---but they may not be ethical after all. In bioethics (or in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; info ethics) we might point out very concrete, contemporary cases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ethics means that the formal schemes of other disciplinary realms have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failed (either economic, legal, or moral---well, &quot;moral&quot;, as least in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the common sense I have taken it,  representing the proto-group 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acceptable behavior for collective survival, is not necessarily formal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all, but quite often it has little to say relating a complex 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; social setting). Overall those regimentations of behavior would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failed to provide sufficient convergence or &quot;closure&quot; on the social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interests. Actually any human community becomes too complicated and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable to yield its &quot;secrets&quot; to any bureaucratic, economic, legal, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific, etc. formulae --am following J.C. Scott, 1998.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ethics, then, would explore the &quot;irreducible&quot; residues of the common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good which have not been detected by those other formal grids. Ethics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explores particularly the new phenomena, the new techs, the new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems, the new achievements, as they impinge on the social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fabric... those very events that will be a matter of legislation and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; economic ruling in a pretty near future. But, how could ethics achieve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its focus on the unfocussed matters? How would social collectives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dramatize those new strange, unruled, conflicting events? Drama, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poetry, music... would they be a good social tool in order to feel the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown, to visualize it, to anticipate it? I think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are lead again to that discussion on &quot;meaning and art&quot; ... where I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subscribe a good portion of Lauri's dictum weeks ago: &quot;arts are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technologies of ethics&quot;. Maybe it could be said differently, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploration direction looks intriguing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best wishes
