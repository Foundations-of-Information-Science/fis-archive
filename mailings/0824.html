**You may disseminate widely - with apologies for duplication **
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br />
<p><p>We, the so called human beings, very often seem to be quite easily 
<br />
fascinated by the assumed power that presumably convey the use of 
<br />
words that some of our more enlightened congeners have invented when 
<br />
each one of them considered indispensable to transfer INFORMATION to 
<br />
somebody else or to COMMUNICATE his or her IDEAS to other humans. 
<br />
Words are the main symbols invented by humans for transferring 
<br />
information to other brains and gradually creating the communication 
<br />
network needed among people for determining how to deal jointly with 
<br />
one or another of those questions that we always managed to identify 
<br />
as our common concerns. However that fascination causes many people 
<br />
to use words without recognizing their content or signification.
<br />
<p>Since those early days, when our ancestors started to make tools 
<br />
purposefully using flakes, chips, sticks and pieces obtained after 
<br />
breaking wood and stone, humans have also been increasingly 
<br />
captivated and even irresistibly bewitched = hypnotized by the 
<br />
insertion of new technological devices and novel methodological 
<br />
recipes and procedures that have been invented for making easier the 
<br />
accomplishment of difficult, boring and tedious tasks required for 
<br />
carrying out all kinds of human affairs. Such a kind of fascination, 
<br />
which during the last century until today has become rather 
<br />
irresistible in some enlightened minds, at present is causing the 
<br />
substitution of masses of human workers by automats, automates and 
<br />
automatons.
<br />
<p>I dare to argue that these two human features have been UNILATERALLY 
<br />
determining the trajectory of the Systems Community during the last 
<br />
five decades, since the Society for General Systems Research could 
<br />
emerged at the end of 1954. Meanwhile some of the main contributions 
<br />
made by Ludwig von Bertalanffy have been simply disregarded because 
<br />
the public and private entities that have been providing funds for 
<br />
the creation of new systems and also for improving the functionality 
<br />
of those in operation are neither interested in really coping with 
<br />
the social and the cultural difficulties that obstruct the evolvement 
<br />
of the poor masses: the so called human resources who refuse to live 
<br />
miserably while compulsively admiring the magnificent features of 
<br />
civilization and being obliged to learn how to esteem the splendors 
<br />
of the highly civilized way of life.
<br />
<p>During the second half of the twentieth century the (Human) World: 
<br />
the so called Homosphere has changed a lot - less for better and a 
<br />
lot more for worse in the common people's view - causing:
<br />
<p>1.	inconvenient disruptions of social, cultural and political 
<br />
features of an increasing number of communities and nations;
<br />
<p>2.	the ecological, biological, ethological and ethical 
<br />
deterioration of terrestrial circumstances without being recognized 
<br />
that the resources and possibilities of Earth are limited; while 
<br />
being ignored that there is not any other planet available for human 
<br />
life.
<br />
<p>Such a dangerous perspective made Bertalanffy to write &quot;I heartily 
<br />
agree that the main objection against current philosophy is its . . . 
<br />
reliance on so-called common sense . . . Society [has] become so 
<br />
complex that traditional ways and means are not sufficient anymore. 
<br />
Approaches of a holistic or systems nature have to be introduced.&quot;
<br />
<p>A holistic approach is the only way of searching consistently how to 
<br />
comprehend the whole nature or character of a particular person. 
<br />
Until today most people are not allowed to develop his or her 
<br />
personality because they are considered simply human resources or 
<br />
soldiers who are taught to behave uniformly as they are considered 
<br />
living objects which must be homogenized in accordance with the rules 
<br />
determined and updated by the highly civilized individuals = the 
<br />
personalities who have been educated for enjoying all the civilized 
<br />
facilities.
<br />
<p>But it has become impossible to ignore that &quot;Each waking day is a 
<br />
stage dominated for good or ill, in comedy, farce or tragedy, by a 
<br />
'dramatis persona', the 'self'. And so it will be until the curtain 
<br />
drops. This self is a unity. The continuity of its presence in time, 
<br />
sometimes hardly broken by sleep, its inalienable 'interiority' in 
<br />
(sensual) space, its consistency of view-point, the privacy of its 
<br />
experience, combine to give it status as a unique existence . . . It 
<br />
regards itself as one, others treat it as one. It is addressed as 
<br />
one, by a name to which it answers. The Law and the State schedule it 
<br />
as one. It and they identify it with a body which is considered by it 
<br />
and them to belong to it integrally. In short, unchallenged and 
<br />
unargued conviction assumes it to be one: The logic of grammar 
<br />
endorses this by a pronoun in the singular: All its diversity is 
<br />
merged into oneness.&quot; [Sherrington, 1951]
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy claimed that it was necessary a &quot;new image of man (and 
<br />
also of woman)&quot; because only humans capable of knowing their personal 
<br />
possibilities and limitations will be able to play consciously their 
<br />
individual roles learning  every one to contribute to determine what 
<br />
might be the destiny of our species.
<br />
<p>Therefore it becomes necessary to create the proper circumstances 
<br />
everywhere for allowing every human to generate his or her ideas 
<br />
about the surrounding reality in accordance with the possibilities 
<br />
that every one might develop when perceiving and interpreting what 
<br />
may concern every one. He or she must learn on his own to search the 
<br />
right words whose content may assure the proper communication.
<br />
<p>At the same time it is also necessary to identify the kind of 
<br />
technological and methodological innovations that are needed for 
<br />
allowing 6,000 million humans to develop conveniently and 
<br />
consistently their physical, manual and intellectual possibilities in 
<br />
order to stop immediately the production of devices and recipes that 
<br />
so far are increasingly introduced in order to condemn  humans to be 
<br />
no more than employed slaves, workers or soldiers or unemployed 
<br />
people though necessarily all of them ought to be good buyers and 
<br />
consumers of anything, everything and even nothing.
