<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>just a brief answer to Tom and a couple of questions about autopiesis
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;INFO &amp; MEANING -- Tom´s response to my previous comments is eloquent and
<br />
very well-crafted. It makes me feel guilty of having been too formal and
<br />
restrictive, for in my previous private exchanges with him I really had
<br />
given a most ponderate view about the strong assets and qualities of the
<br />
book (first of all: it is very well written!). He is quite right that
<br />
embarking oneself into this type of synthesis, outside the protective
<br />
university environment, is a formidable venture...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, here I am again with the Energy&amp;Info topic. The KT &quot;minimum
<br />
thermodynamic prize for distinguishablity from an environment&quot; (also
<br />
pointed out by Efim, Michael, and quite a few people related to
<br />
biocomputing and quantum computing) should be another way of restating the
<br />
relationship between joules and bits. I believe that when Tom obliterates
<br />
the logaritmic transformation of the number of microstates in Boltzmann
<br />
formula he should arrive at this same result: the minimum energy difference
<br />
between to different microstates. May I ask the considerate opinion of our
<br />
thermodynamicist colleagues (now, or in the physics coming conference)?
<br />
<p>THE DIFFERENCE WHICH MAKES A DIFFERENCE--that´s exactly what Tom quantifies
<br />
(its limit!) and takes as the &quot;grain&quot; of the INFO magnitude. Can Soeren
<br />
agree about this thermodynamic &quot;tag&quot; to his Batesonian approach (the
<br />
&quot;observer&quot; becomes now the quantum computer scientist, or the
<br />
thermodynamicist working at ideal conditions). The further difference in
<br />
epistemological and ontological views is another story. I would say Tom
<br />
prefers &quot;objectivism&quot; (sci. truth) and &quot;materialism&quot; (particles) and Soeren
<br />
&quot;constructivism&quot; (social construc), and &quot;theoretical-structuralism&quot;
<br />
(theories and relationships instead of &quot;particles&quot;). Of course, both views
<br />
enrich our collective &quot;multiperspectivistic&quot; storage of knowledge.
<br />
<p>INFOPOIESIS -- Perhaps from the info microstate we could jump up to the
<br />
vast array of self-constructive processes that autopiesis considers.
<br />
However, my point is that any &quot;info society&quot; is characterized by a strange
<br />
(info mediated) coupling between self PRODUCTION (OK, autopoiesis) and self
<br />
DESTRUCTION (no general name: but obviously patent in the astonishing
<br />
cellular world of proteases and proteasomes,in the necessary apoptotic
<br />
process of organismic cells, in the growth and disappearance of synaptic
<br />
sites, in the economicly necessary disappearance of 30 % of companies every
<br />
3 or 4 years... I would suggest &quot;autonecrosis&quot; as a provisional term). So
<br />
to speak, INFO entities rejuvenate themselves, and adapt to their changing
<br />
environment, by a sort of global INFOPOIESIS that couple both AP and AN
<br />
(&quot;autonecrosis&quot;). Perhaps the signaling (info) mediated processes that
<br />
every enzyme iremediably follows from RIBOSOME to PROTEASOME (first, from
<br />
&quot;soup&quot; to cradle; later on, from the coffin to &quot;soup&quot; again) becomes the
<br />
clearest biological example.
<br />
<p>And a final jump to &quot;languages&quot;:
<br />
Most of the natural info that permeates such AP &amp; AN (so, globally
<br />
&quot;infopoietic&quot;) processes is not POSITIONAL but COMPOSITIONAL. Accordingly,
<br />
on the one side we would have our own languages, DNA coding, computer
<br />
languages, etc. which work by processing symbols in strict positional
<br />
succession, a la Shannon. And on the other side we would have cellular
<br />
languages built upon info exchanges by chemical compositions arriving in
<br />
bulk, both intracellular and intercellularly, and also numerous social and
<br />
ethological languages of odors, colors, gestures, emotions (perhaps
<br />
including our own musical and pictoric languages) that follow the other
<br />
compositional style of info. &quot;Maverick&quot; Karl Javorszky has produced a
<br />
&quot;partitional calculus&quot; that I am trying to apply to the language of cells
<br />
(and has much inspired these lines themselves)... Anyhow, summarizing about
<br />
languages, I would strongly disagree with strict semiotic views that only
<br />
discuss info &amp; language in our own (terribly limited) speech apparatus.
<br />
<p>I adore the current philo discussion, and hope not having introduced much
<br />
cacophony,
<br />
<p>bests
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Thanks to our new colleague Birger for his greetings a few days ago...
