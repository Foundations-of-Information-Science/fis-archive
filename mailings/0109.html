<p>
Dear Jerry,
<br />
dear colleagues
<br />
<p>In responding to your last two messages (sorry for the delay) I will group
<br />
the topics in four separated blocks:
<br />
<p><p>1. INFORMATION AND BIOCHEMISTRY.
<br />
<p>The problem I see with the physical and biochemical approaches to the
<br />
phenomenon of life (and of bioinfo), following your very arguments, is
<br />
largely similar to the discussions at the end of the 80's between the
<br />
practitioners of Artificial Intelligence and of Artificial Life --this was
<br />
the underlying sense of some of the questions in my previous message.
<br />
<p>Although the &quot;brute force&quot; approach of the former AI was &quot;logically&quot;
<br />
correct, in the same sense than you have argued about biochemically
<br />
systematic counting, mapping functions and one-to one correspondence, it
<br />
turned out to be an approach scarcely relevant in order to advance the
<br />
knowledge of neuronal (bio)processing. Rodney Brooks crafted very well the
<br />
arguments on why a new computational approach (ALife) were necessary --if
<br />
the further evolution of AL has really fulfilled its initial promises and
<br />
their new strategy has been fertile is another matter. I would encapsulate
<br />
Brooks' message as the &quot;rebellion of infinities&quot;: the AI impossible logical
<br />
management of the multiple emerging infinities in the encounter of any
<br />
logical agent with the complexities of a natural environment.
<br />
<p>Perhaps the same is happenning here. Infinities may be found one after the
<br />
other when you try to &quot;count&quot; e.g. how an enzyme folds, how it &quot;fishes&quot; for
<br />
its substrate and transforms its electronic structures (implying in both
<br />
cases the whole panoply of electromagnetic forces, vand der Waals forces,
<br />
hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic forces, electro weak interactions, etc.!!!),
<br />
not to speak about how millions and billions of these molecules orchestrate
<br />
their individual and collective activities... (this is one of the reasons
<br />
why molecular biology remains largely empirical and pragmatic).  Any
<br />
further response that one can always give a logical &quot;kinetic counting&quot; is
<br />
tantamount to hide the rub under the carpet. Precisely because of this very
<br />
exhibition of complexities, there may emerge, from enzymes upwards, the
<br />
amazing &quot;info-processing abilities&quot; of life (including neuro-processing and
<br />
intelligence). And not from any other (yet unknown) set of inert chemicals.
<br />
The fact is that &quot;taming infinities&quot; keeps being the regular business of
<br />
cells and of organisms (let us think on the math. graph of a trillion
<br />
interlinked neuronal processes).
<br />
<p>I assume that you are impecable in your own exposition of the biochemical
<br />
perspective. But maybe it has the same relevance, concerning the further
<br />
organization of bioinfo, as the laws of solid-state physics have concerning
<br />
the workings of any of these clever computers around us. The biotricks to
<br />
overcome the series of infinity barriers --&quot;abduction&quot; of just the very few
<br />
RELEVANT traits-- would not necessarily be amenable to the brute force
<br />
(logical) approach.
<br />
<p><p>2. WATER
<br />
<p>That substance is something more than a &quot;source of protons (as its
<br />
taxonomical bioch. role)&quot;. In a relatively recent review (in Nature, 1996),
<br />
the question on how water structures interact with macromolecules, solute
<br />
ions, and colloidal particles, largely appears as an unanswered one. The
<br />
amazing solvent, viscous, dielectric, electromagnetic, and crystalline
<br />
properties of water are continuously called into action as a means of
<br />
putting an overall GLUE (let us remember Ray4s quest) in life activities.
<br />
Water is a source of protons, but it is also the vehicle for prot. folding,
<br />
an active player in every enzymic function, a background of multiple
<br />
biophysical-electromagnectic processes, but above all it is the massive
<br />
interconnecting tool of bioinfo processes (coming back to the parallel with
<br />
computers, water solves &quot;de gratis&quot; the awful WIRING PROBLEM that plagues
<br />
the design of electronic VLSI circuits). Both intracellularly and
<br />
intercellularly, water becomes an actual &quot;newspaper&quot; that contains in its
<br />
successive pages the RELEVANT info items to search for... (and this would
<br />
lead to the story of how to analyze compositional info--but this is
<br />
becoming too long).
<br />
<p><p>3. &quot;PRESENCES VERSUS ABSCENCES&quot;
<br />
<p>I made, a few years ago, a very simple automaton model of a regulated
<br />
enzyme function. Its output was a binary series (just 0s and 1s) in
<br />
response to a series of binary inputs (substrate and effectors). Well,
<br />
someone argued me about the info behind every bit of the output. The &quot;0&quot;, I
<br />
was told, represented a mere absence, so just one bit. But every &quot;1&quot; had
<br />
behind it all the above story about enzyme non-picturable function...
<br />
<p>OK about the 1s, but, was it true that the &quot;0&quot; was almost info-free?.
<br />
<p>My belated response was the idea of &quot;functional voids&quot; to be filled-in by
<br />
the productive machinery of the cell (eg. a call to protein synthesis
<br />
because the specific enzyme is out of work). So absences may have a genuine
<br />
info content in the intra and intercellular communicating games--so
<br />
implying that the &quot;0&quot; might be even far richer than the &quot;1&quot;. This means, in
<br />
another words, the necessary connection of the signaling (info) processes
<br />
with the underlying productive and degradative activities of the living.
<br />
But I am affraid that, in these discussions, I have already argued about
<br />
the connection between signaling INFO - and the balanced PRODUCTION of the
<br />
own structures (the idea of self-organized criticality, and the
<br />
one-sidedness of autopiesis) and do not want to insist further.
<br />
<p><p>4. THE LANGUAGE OF CELLS
<br />
<p>Unfortunately Josi and me are at the beginning of the beginning. Our
<br />
exploration on the possibilities of &quot;partitions&quot; as formal descriptive
<br />
tools of cellular signaling systems has started a few months ago. But we
<br />
much thank your thoughtful comments and questions, for they have put some
<br />
of our searches in a different light.
<br />
<p><p>regards from Zaragoza
<br />
<p>Pedro
