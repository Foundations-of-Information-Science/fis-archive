Dear Koichiro:
<br />
<p>In order to stimulate this conversation, I will attempt to respond to
<br />
your very insightful questions from the perspective of a biochemist.  I
<br />
probably am not adequately trained to understand the physical point of
<br />
view; nevertheless, another perspective may help the conversation get
<br />
started.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear FIS Colleagues:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Information of the Population One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If a population of many individuals is available, it may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be possible to assign to each representative inidividual its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information content. In contrast, if the population has only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One Individual like the Gaia, how could one assign to it its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information content? Or, is it a wrong question?
</em><br />
<p>I think this is a question about closure - what is the domain of
<br />
discourse?
<br />
Information theory starts from the notion of a probability space and a
<br />
probability distribution.  These terms are purely matheamtical in nature
<br />
and no material or dynamic constraints exist on them.  Thus most any
<br />
proability space will do and any probability distribution will do.  One
<br />
mathematical constraint on any probablility distribution is that the sum
<br />
of the probabilies of possible events (objects?)  equal one. 
<br />
If the probability distribution is composed of a single object, then the
<br />
probability is one and no uncertainty exists (mathematically).  From the
<br />
definition of Shannon information, the information content is zero
<br />
(since ln 1 = 0).
<br />
This first question introduces the general problem of the necessary
<br />
condition for congruency between observations, semantics, and symbols. 
<br />
Clearly, our planet earth is composed from local dynamic processes which
<br />
are information-rich.  By an appropriate choice of semantics and
<br />
symbols, one can contradict the observations (at a different reference
<br />
scale!)   :-)   :-)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Information and Thermodynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Although this dichotomy has attracted lively attention
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from many physicists for almost a century by now, the issue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not seem to be settled yet. Is information an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unnecessary appendage to thermodynamics or vice versa?
</em><br />
<p>By definition, classical thermodynamics is a science of heat
<br />
tansformations.  Can anyone provide an example of observations which
<br />
estabish a one-to-one correspondence between units of heat and discrete
<br />
units of information? I believe that intrinsic to your second question
<br />
is the issue of the relationship between continuous and discrete
<br />
functions.  Does information necessarily have to be discrete as proposed
<br />
by Shannon?  Human bodies can function in accordance with thermodynamic
<br />
principles.  Are human judgments composed from only discrete
<br />
information? Or are continuous functions necessary for human judgment? 
<br />
Or are human judgments composed from both discrete and continuous forms
<br />
of information?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Information and Quantum Mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    A notorious problem with quantum mechanics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement, the latter of which seems an indispensable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute of information. In addition, quantum mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is quite entangled in the manner of specifying its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wavefunction nonlocally, not to mention quantum teleportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a recent Innsbruck vintage. How can both measurement in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM and quantum entanglement be related to the issue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information?
</em><br />
<p>Is this question an artifact of the assumptions of quantum mechanics? 
<br />
In other words, I could view this as a different form of a &quot;closure&quot;
<br />
problem.
<br />
Does Quantum Mechanics start from a systematic perspective of
<br />
interactions between ALL particles in the system and assert that a class
<br />
of differential equations will describe the evolution of the system?   
<br />
Do these differential equations intrinsically assert closure to any
<br />
other influence?  In other words, in an analogy with a thermodynamic
<br />
sense, is a quantum mechanical system an isolated system?  Is this the
<br />
source of the measurement problem?  Is it possible to make a metaphor
<br />
between the measurement problem and &quot;begging the question&quot;?  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Information and Conservation Laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Physics has founded itself upon various conservation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws such as energy conservation. How could information of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an evolutionary and historical character be compatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with conservation laws? Are they an odd couple?
</em><br />
<p>Conservation laws come in many forms and have many uses.  But, I am not
<br />
aware of any conservation law which specifies all possible aggregations
<br />
of atoms into chemical forms or the dynamics of interchanges among such
<br />
chemical forms.  The chemical composition of the matter within living
<br />
systems can follow conservation laws and still have access to many
<br />
potential dynamical behaviors and many potential chemical forms. 
<br />
Biological evolution  is associated with freedom to explore that which
<br />
is not physically or chemically  forbidden.  Analogously, human cultural
<br />
evolution continuously emerges into new patterns despite the
<br />
ever-increasing numbers of do's and don't's (rules, regulations, laws,
<br />
etc).  So, is it the existence of the rules which forbid some behaviors
<br />
that motivates systems to search for new behaviors which do not violate
<br />
old rules and still achieve the objectives?  :-)  :-)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) Information and Physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    An outspoken critic may say this. Information has its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own business, and physics has its own, too. There may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no need to connect the two if you are busy and cannot spare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your time for doing something else. A second critic may say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information is much deeper than physics as swaying John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wheeler's banner printing &quot;It From Bits&quot;. A third critic may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; jump in and remind us of Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker's motto
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on any production process that is certainly physical, roughly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying &quot;Information is that which produces information&quot;. Are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of them sane?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>A colleague defined physics to me as the art of finding the simple in
<br />
the complex.  Is physics an extreme form of pragmatism?  Is it most
<br />
successful when simple linear representations (and occasionally
<br />
quadratic forms) yield useful results?  Is information theory useful
<br />
when one can approximate natural systems with simple distributions, such
<br />
as binary choices?
<br />
The sentence
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Information has its own business, and physics has its own, too.&quot; 
<br />
<p>deserves careful inspection from a philosophical perspective.  Are the
<br />
terms &quot;information&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; more than semantic sub-classes of our
<br />
historical efforts to communicate with one another?  Is either term
<br />
representable in terms of either observations or symbols in the same
<br />
sense that we represent the number two with &quot;2&quot; or the atom of sulfur
<br />
with the symbol S?  Does either of these terms admit closure?  In other
<br />
words, can we place meaningful boundaries around these terms such that
<br />
we can form definitive distinctions between them?
<br />
<p>I have sought to raise more questions in order to promote a lively
<br />
discussion.  Hopefully, I have stimulated further questions which will
<br />
help me understand these questions better.
<br />
<p>Sincerely
<br />
