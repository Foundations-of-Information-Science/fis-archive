<p>
Dear Pedro and collegaues,
<br />
<p><p>Anyhow, my general opinion on the problem of social complexity is that,
<br />
like its homonymous biological counterpart, it stands beyond formal
<br />
approaches, at the time being. Let us remind the recent exchanges on
<br />
&quot;biological computation&quot;...  If so, requests to directly algorithmize it,
<br />
are ill posed directions: without new approaches to info it cannot be done
<br />
meaningfully.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<p>In my opinion, this conclusion is drawn much too early and too much based on
<br />
modelling the social system from the perspective of a biologist. Two
<br />
important steps (since most relevant for the algorithmic approaches) have
<br />
been suggested in which social systems differ from biological systems, at
<br />
least in terms of the relative weights of subdynamics:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
1. the unit of analysis. Unlike biological systems, social systems are not
<br />
aggregates of individuals. Thus, the individual or the aggregate of
<br />
individuals (e.g., in people) are not the proper unit of analysis, and the
<br />
corresponding requirement of micro-foundation (prevalent in neo-classical
<br />
economics) should not be accepted at forehand. The coordination mechanisms
<br />
among human beings are generating the complexity. Therefore, communication
<br />
(or another mechanism of social coordination?) should be considered itself
<br />
as the unit of analysis. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This makes the analysis more complex and more simple. Communications cannot
<br />
be directly observed, but one can observe their &quot;footprints&quot;. However,
<br />
communication systems can be hypothesized and then the specified
<br />
expectations can be tested against the data. Furthermore, we have an elegant
<br />
apparatus in the mathematical theory of communication (and its elaboration
<br />
into non-linear dynamics) for the operationalization. Communications are
<br />
distributed, both socially and temporarily. The distributions can be
<br />
expected to contain information (which is communicated when the systems
<br />
operate).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
2. the nature of the operation has to be specified. While
<br />
information-processing proceeds with the axis of time, meaning is provided
<br />
from the perspective of hindsight. Thus, the axis of time has to be inverted
<br />
locally in the model. The inversion can lead to stabilization. This
<br />
inversion is reinforced when meaning can also be communicated. This
<br />
next-order inversion may lead to globalization. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
How does the probabilistic entropy evolve when these feedback mechanisms are
<br />
operating on the information-processing. This is studied in computing
<br />
anticipatory systems (Rosen, 1985; Dubois, 1998). It is clear by now that
<br />
the mechanisms of anticipatory systems are very different from those without
<br />
anticipation and that anticipation can be specified in terms of strong and
<br />
weak anticiation, leading to different equations. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
For example, the anticipatory formulation of the logistic equation does not
<br />
lead to chaotic phenomena when the bifurcation paramater approaches the
<br />
value of four, as it does in population dynamics. Thus, meaning-processing
<br />
systems (like studied in psychologies or sociologies) should not be studied
<br />
using a biological model without further reflection. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This is not to say that in mathematical biology, one is not interested in
<br />
anticipation and communication. On the contrary, Robert Rosen's work is to
<br />
be celebrated! However, one is often not sufficiently aware that at the
<br />
level of weakly anticipatory systems like human beings (who can entertain
<br />
models of themselves and their environments and make predictions on this
<br />
basis) and at the level of strongly anticipatory systems like social systems
<br />
which are under specific conditions able to restructure their future (e.g.,
<br />
using technosciences), other mechanisms prevail in the complex communication
<br />
dynamics then the ones which can be derived from biological systems. The
<br />
latter, for example, may exhibit a life-cycle, while a social system is not
<br />
born: it emerges using a mechanism different from the underlying one or in
<br />
other words as a structural coupling (Maturana).
<br />
