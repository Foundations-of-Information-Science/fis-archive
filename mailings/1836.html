<p>
Good Day, 
<br />
<p>I hope this mail meets you in good time. My proposal to you 
<br />
will be very surprising, as we have not had any Personal 
<br />
contact. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this 
<br />
transaction, which I propose to you as a man of integrity. First
<br />
and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. 
<br />
<p>My name is Joseph Savimbi; I am a nephew and Personal Assistant 
<br />
to Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, the leader of UNITA (National Union 
<br />
for the Total Independence of Angola). I got your email address 
<br />
from a directory, in my search for a partner for this 
<br />
transaction, hence this letter. You may know that my Uncle was 
<br />
recently killed in a battle with the government troops of 
<br />
Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 
<br />
2002. After my Uncle's death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his 
<br />
second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, and UNITA 
<br />
was in a state of turmoil. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich 
<br />
themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their 
<br />
ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. 
<br />
<p>The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when 
<br />
Mr.Dembo died 10days after my Uncle died. Being a young man who 
<br />
desires a peaceful life, I am no more interested in conflicts 
<br />
and wars, this is why I secretly left Angola and came here 
<br />
(EGYPT) to seek political asylum. I am sincerely seeking for 
<br />
your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some 
<br />
of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money 
<br />
(US$18.5million), is already in a Security Agency in europe. The entire information to the account is with me, for i logged the 
<br />
funds myself, using my name and information&#x2019;s. 
<br />
<p>As a matter of fact, this is the reason I chose to come to Egypt to seek for political asylum. It is very clear with the way 
<br />
things are now, that President Dos Santos will lobby the 
<br />
International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts
<br />
abroad, to ground UNITA, since he has already done this in 
<br />
Angola. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is 
<br />
very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and 
<br />
confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of 
<br />
desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, 
<br />
ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost 
<br />
secrecy. 
<br />
<p>The help I need from you is withdrawing the fund deposited in my name, from the Agency, after which, the money will be 
<br />
transferred to your account preferably a new account you should 
<br />
open for this transaction. My share of the money will be 
<br />
returned to me when my asylum application is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your 
<br />
reliable assistance, I will reward you with a bargained 
<br />
percentage when we agree to do business togerther. I have with 
<br />
me, all necessary information&#x2019;s on how you can retrieve 
<br />
the funds. Also, everything will be legally processed for 
<br />
transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be 
<br />
completed immediately depending on your prompt response. 
<br />
<p>I will give you the name of the Agency and further 
<br />
information&#x2019;s when you decide to go into business with me, 
<br />
you should know that i need to withhold those 
<br />
information&#x2019;s for know till i know more about you and your 
<br />
willingness to go into this business with me. I thank you in 
<br />
advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve 
<br />
this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested 
<br />
in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner 
<br />
in the event of non-interest on your part. 
<br />
<p>Sincerely, J.Savimbi.
