(The initial receipt of this message lacked carrage returns and was
<br />
difficult to read.  Bob asked me to forward this (readable) copy to FIS)
<br />
<p>(Can I ask you to forward this to the mailer if it arrived in one
<br />
piece?)
<br />
<p>Responding to Pedro Marijuan, Morris Villarroel, Gottfried Stockinger,
<br />
Andreas Goppols, Werner Ebeling, and Jerry Chandler regarding the Royal
<br />
Road to complexity, social stuff, and FITNESS:
<br />
<p>For a long time I have wanted to find the vehicle for getting from
<br />
biologically to socially stored information, and it looks to me as if
<br />
the
<br />
issues raised by Morris and Pedro may do that for us.  To begin with, we
<br />
respect Morris's call to parsimony.  But we need, I think, to equally
<br />
recognize the point Jacob made in his notion of evolution by
<br />
briccolagewhatever is in the biology will be used for new purposes and
<br />
thus take on new &quot;meaning&quot; when it is used serendipitously in social
<br />
evolution.  There is some work by Thomas Spence Smith which has always
<br />
seemed promising to me in this regard.  He builds on an addiction model,
<br />
relating various electro-chemical flows in the brain to responses to
<br />
behaviors.  I think you can get from the pleasure-pain processing of
<br />
information on the organic level to the VEM guidance of actions and
<br />
choices on the social level by substituting a symbolically stored piece
<br />
of
<br />
information for past experience.  Performing behaviors in accordance
<br />
with
<br />
the script in VEMs is rewarded and a social role is played more or less
<br />
as
<br />
an addiction.
<br />
<p>It looks to me as if Pedro is offering a more generalized view of the
<br />
process, and that is what is badly needed.  To follow very far, however,
<br />
people like me need a course in biology from him.  If Pedro would push
<br />
into a little more detail about what the biological analogies/homologies
<br />
might be, however, it would be very helpful.  I suspect there are
<br />
qualitatively different things going on but that the processes follow
<br />
similar patterns.  If, e.g., we could try to track some parallel between
<br />
how experience is recorded and stored in social structures and
<br />
biological
<br />
organisms we might be able to trace the qualitative changes arising from
<br />
membership in social systems.
<br />
<p>But I would still want to concentrate on SOCIAL SYSTEMS and be able to
<br />
discriminate between social systems of various kinds.  Looking at things
<br />
historically, at changes in time independent of extra-natural forces, I
<br />
must postulate that some human actions affect the world in ways that
<br />
feedback on the human actors and change them.  Raids introducing
<br />
structure
<br />
into neighboring bands which then must be mapped by the raiders because
<br />
that structure is part of their environment is an example of how
<br />
initiatives generated at some primal (?) level can feedback to transform
<br />
the originating actors.  The introduction of agriculture is a more
<br />
subtle
<br />
and complicated example showing the same thing: Societies constitute
<br />
themselves in the act of constituting their worlds.
<br />
<p>In these examples, a group of people acting collectively makes
<br />
themselves
<br />
aware of their world and then of their collective identity.  (Cosmogenic
<br />
myths always precede Origin myths, I am told.)  These awarenesses would
<br />
not involve any change in the biological people involved but would take
<br />
their evolved brains, connect them together through symbolic language,
<br />
and
<br />
give them an attribute they did not possess biologically: consciousness
<br />
in
<br />
a fully human sense, for instance.  I would think that primate brains
<br />
were
<br />
not developed enough to experience fully human consciousness, while I
<br />
believe there is ample evidence from the earliest records in the West,
<br />
at
<br />
least, to support the idea that the first historically visible people
<br />
displayed no awareness of this fully human sort.  (I know: we need a
<br />
definition of fully human consciousness.)  
<br />
<p>We could work out more precisely how this happens from better understood
<br />
biological etc models.  You guys need to do that.  But the point would
<br />
be
<br />
to look for ways to understand how Pedro's &quot;translation or ...
<br />
reverberation of biological fitness&quot; works.  I would expect there to be
<br />
a
<br />
rather large, symmetry-breaking discontinuity between propensities
<br />
generated biologically and actions chosen morally.  Early Roman legends,
<br />
e.g., tell of how sons were killed by fathers for violating tribal
<br />
interests.  If that is so, the symbols mapping the tribal
<br />
interestsVEMswould capture more than information about families,
<br />
relatives, etc.  Although there might be some selective advantage for
<br />
those genetically better equipped to cooperate, I would bet you cannot
<br />
find any way to deduce VEMs from genetic concerns.  That is because what
<br />
VEMs map is not just what individuals do but what individual choices and
<br />
actions MEAN.  
<br />
<p>That is, VEMs are mapping the enlarged environment created by collective
<br />
action in which a society is now embedded.  This is a new KIND of world,
<br />
and new KINDS of information describe it.  VEMs perform tasks in this
<br />
realm comparable to DNA in biologythey enable societies to replicate by
<br />
catalyzing the behaviors characteristic of Social Roles, which are the
<br />
non-material elements constituting social organizations.  VEMs catalyze
<br />
actions by symbolize meaning.  Playing social Roles, people internalize
<br />
meaning and acquire agency, along with self-awareness a corner-stone of
<br />
fully human consciousness. (I am happy Andreas confesses difficulty
<br />
seeing
<br />
how behaviors are stuffI wanted people to make the effort to bend their
<br />
minds around the implication that social systems would, again, be new
<br />
kinds of reality.  To us material components, the relationships
<br />
constituting societies would be intangiblebut that is because we are
<br />
talking about the reality of an ORGANIZATION.  We cannot confuse our
<br />
physical bodies with the substance of societies.)
<br />
<p>To be sure, biological givens play a part in ratcheting the potential
<br />
for
<br />
cooperative action upward.  But I suspect that there is an even more
<br />
dramatic change once a social system self-organizes than Pedro suggests.
<br />
It looks to me, as if there is a new criteria introduced for fitness, as
<br />
he says.  &quot;Social&quot; selection--like sexual selection?may operate on
<br />
criteria that are not particularly fit from a natural environmental
<br />
point
<br />
of view.  But if females like some male attributemale peacock feathers
<br />
are
<br />
the obvious examplethen this trait will be selected for procreating
<br />
before
<br />
its value for &quot;natural selection&quot; is tested.  Similarly, behaviors that
<br />
are socially desirable may be quite radically different from what is
<br />
naturally fit.  I.e., the biologically given propensities which make
<br />
possible the self-organization of social systems change in their new
<br />
context through briccolage,.
<br />
<p>There must be orderings at relatively low levels to permit any sort of
<br />
social system to emerge.  Then the nonlinear growth possible once
<br />
relatively simple societies self-organize would indeed be the Royal Road
<br />
to complexity.  People might have found ways to represent some inherited
<br />
attribute symbolically, think about it, and then rapidly accelerate
<br />
either
<br />
the attribute's direction or strength.  Each of these developments would
<br />
have fluctuated relations with others and obliged them to similarly
<br />
examine and develop themselves.  On rare occasions, individual behaviors
<br />
correlated so tightly that, in effect, a new level of reality
<br />
emergedsocieties, which in turn were able to evolve.  But these more
<br />
complex social systems would take time to evolve, and their first
<br />
systems
<br />
for storing ordering information would probably not be VEMs.  I think
<br />
the
<br />
anthropologists are rightit was rituals and rites which first stored
<br />
information about successful collective efforts.  Thus, it was simply by
<br />
replicating behaviors that social organization was copied.  Ritualized
<br />
storage was limited, however, and VEM symbols proved better able to map
<br />
the increasing number of states societies could access.  In this process
<br />
societies became increasingly complex, and, I suspect, the symbols
<br />
describing the society and recording reduced uncertainty about its
<br />
environment similarly evolved.  
<br />
<p>Suggesting that some societies are more complex than others will, I
<br />
know,
<br />
open the door to accusations of Political Incorrectness and complaints
<br />
that Comtean positivism is being restored.  But unless everything is the
<br />
same and nothing happens in history, I think we need to recognize that
<br />
degrees of complexity exist between societies.  I also think that as the
<br />
complexity of social systems increases the information storage capacity
<br />
of
<br />
its symbol systems must increase, as well.  The shift in symbols to VEMs
<br />
and later between early and more recent VEMs would then seem to offer a
<br />
way to talk about fitnessqualitatively, to be sure, but Werner Ebeling
<br />
is
<br />
right-- qualitatively IS the way to talk about VEMs.  We then find, I
<br />
think, that VEMs encouraging the propensity for people to be more
<br />
self-conscious, autonomous, expressive, and active give social systems a
<br />
competitive advantage in competition with OTHER SOCIAL SYSTEMS.  There
<br />
is
<br />
then a reason why the fit survive, and the old saw that Darwinism is
<br />
merely tautology is finessed.
<br />
<p>In any case, once the system is there, it would be correct to shift our
<br />
focus to information about IT.  We should not want to reduce social
<br />
information to biology but we do want to test the value of
<br />
analogies/homologies in social applications.  Can those better equipped
<br />
to
<br />
lay out some of the biology do that, allowing the rest of us to then
<br />
flounder foolishly about reaching and straining for parallels?  This way
<br />
we could get an interdisciplinary attack on the fundamentals of
<br />
information science because we can trace parallels between fields.
<br />
<p>Once again apologizing for lengthy communications, I remain your Humble
<br />
and Obedient Servant,
<br />
Bob Artigiani
