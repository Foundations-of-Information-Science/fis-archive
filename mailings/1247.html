<br />
<p><p>Efficient, Formal and Final Causes in Heterarchy
<br />
Information science and also systems science has a problem of how meaning 
<br />
and mind are created in evolution through emergence, when it does not state 
<br />
an explicit metaphysics. Peirce thereby gives a foundation that supports 
<br />
the evolutionary theory of system science and cybernetics. This happens 
<br />
when the semiotic foundation is combined with the informational systems and 
<br />
cybernetic grand schemes like Tom Stonier&#x2019;s work (1997), or the Neauchatell 
<br />
spiral of Eric Schwartz (1997).
<br />
The cybernetic thinking of self-organization and system closure has, in my 
<br />
opinion, made an important contribution to our understanding of living 
<br />
systems. But a combination of Peircian semiotics and modern cybernetics is 
<br />
necessary to create a theory broad enough to include what is now called 
<br />
biosemiotics, and encompass the core-epistemological problem of the 
<br />
semiotic threshold. Biosemiotics, in both name and scope, has a tendency to 
<br />
neglect the contribution of second-order cybernetics and autopoietic 
<br />
theory, while cyberneticians, whose work combines and develops the area of 
<br />
human social communication, tends to ignore the semiotic component (Ort and 
<br />
Marcus 1999). In order to combine the contributions of both camps, a 
<br />
broader foundation is needed. This is why I call my work Cybersemiotics, 
<br />
which is actually short for Cyberbiosemiotics, as it is a further 
<br />
development of biosemiotics (Brier 2003 is the last summary of the theory).
<br />
Modern systems thinking views nature as Nature containing multilevel, 
<br />
multidimensional hierarchies of inter-related clusters forming a 
<br />
heterogeneous general hierarchy of processual structures: A Heterarchy. In 
<br />
the Fuschl conversation meeting April 2002, sponsored by the International 
<br />
Federation of Systems Research (IFSR), the FIS-group discussed these 
<br />
matters. Inspired by the conclusion of this work and the above analysis, 
<br />
one can sketch the following scenario for meaning in the universe:
<br />
1.      Levels emerge through emergent processes when new holons appear 
<br />
through higher level organization. These principles can be placed into a 
<br />
Peircean perspective, where potentialities (Firstness) are processes 
<br />
manifested through constraints and forces (Secondness), into regularities 
<br />
and patterns (Thirdness). This process is continuing in a recursive manner 
<br />
from level to level. The new emergent level then acts as a potential for 
<br />
the development of the next level.
<br />
2.      Levels can form and dissolve when their dynamical parameters are 
<br />
near critical points, like when nucleons form and dissolve in a &#x201c;quark 
<br />
soup&#x201d;. Stabilization requires that the system moves further from the 
<br />
critical point into organizing patterns, like energy wells.
<br />
3.      In hierarchies there is a filtering of lower-level effects rising 
<br />
from the bottom at each new emergent level. But there is also a binding 
<br />
from the top, and the exclusion of alternative possibilities once one path 
<br />
of emergence has stabilized (Downward causation).
<br />
4.      Across levels, various forms of causation (Efficient: based on 
<br />
energy transfer, Formal: based on pattern recognition, signal and 
<br />
information, and Final: based on meaningful purpose and thus semiotic) are 
<br />
more or less explicit (manifest). This leads to more or less explicit 
<br />
manifestations of information and semiotic meaning at the various levels in 
<br />
the world of energy and matter. The basic forms of causation can be seen at 
<br />
all levels. Efficient causation is grounded in the Quantum vaccum, 
<br />
zero-energy fields. But for each level the next lower level acts as its 
<br />
material basis.
<br />
5.      Emergent process laws are peculiar to each level, allowing 
<br />
components to function together, and stabilizing levels in 
<br />
pattern-formation and structure that can be described with an objective 
<br />
information concept. This yields the dynamical integration that 
<br />
individuates each level. In the special case in which this integration 
<br />
involves active organizational processes we have autonomy, which is, 
<br />
roughly speaking, a partially open form of autopoiesis that creates agency. 
<br />
Kaufmann (1995) calls it &#x2018;autocatalytical closure&#x2019;.
<br />
6.       It seems that total closure, as in autopoiesis, is important in 
<br />
the creation of living systems. But the necessary degree of closure is 
<br />
still under discussion. Hoffmeyer (1998) describes four additional steps 
<br />
necessary for the creation of living systems, namely the establishment of 
<br />
an inside-outside asymmetry (closed surface), then a proto-communication 
<br />
over those surfaces is necessary (a community of surfaces); further a 
<br />
digital re-description in the form of DNA to carry on the form of the 
<br />
organism in procreation is necessary (Hoffmeyer and Emmeche (1991) call it 
<br />
code-duality.) Finally, the formation of an interface (inside-outside 
<br />
loops) is essential for the creation of interpretants. Machines lack 
<br />
autopoiesis, reproduction, code-duality, and an inner organization of 
<br />
membranes, and thus also lack both individually- and species-based 
<br />
motivation and intentionality and therefore consequently also the ability 
<br />
to establish a genuine interpretant.
<br />
7.      Meaning is generated through the whole heterachy, especially 
<br />
through individual systems&#x2019; relations to a larger natural or social 
<br />
context. Thus, meaning is both generated on the individual levels of the 
<br />
living or humans as well as in social systems.
<br />
8.      Meaning is most manifest in the living systems that fulfill 
<br />
Hoffmeyer&#x2019;s conditions. But starting from dissipative systems, one can 
<br />
define a heterarchy of pre-living self-organized systems as based on 
<br />
degrees of closure, asymmetry between inside and outside, protocomunication 
<br />
over membranes, digital representation and formation of interfaces.
<br />
9.      The autonomous systems are related to various notions of meaningful 
<br />
functionality that in turn are connected to various types of causality: 
<br />
efficient, formal, final. The most full-blown version of meaning involves 
<br />
finality in a self-conscious social-linguistic mind.
<br />
10.     Distinctions in notions of meaning, according to social, 
<br />
representational meaning versus personal, subjective, existential 
<br />
meaningfulness, are further differentiations. These are dependent on a 
<br />
theory of consciousness yet to be developed, where the biosemiotic theory 
<br />
and worldview will be an important contribution.
<br />
<p>Thanks to Allan Combs and John Collier that contributed significant to this 
<br />
work.
<br />
Combining the results of modern science with Peircian biosemiotics, the 
<br />
cybersemiotic framework operates on five levels of existence:
<br />
a)      A primary chaotic level of continuity, quality, and potentiality, 
<br />
with the tendency to form habits (Firstness). This would include the 
<br />
quantum vacuum field as it is conceptualized by modern physics as one 
<br />
aspect only.
<br />
b)      A &#x201c;causal&#x201d; level of matter, energy, and causality by natural forces
<br />
(Secondness and its &#x2018;brute force&#x2019;). The level of efficient causation much 
<br />
connected with physics.
<br />
c)      An informational cybernetic system level of quasi-semiotic signals 
<br />
that encompass the goal-oriented mechanical systems described by 
<br />
first-order classical cybernetics. Described from a cybersemiotic view, 
<br />
concepts of information as signals of differences make sense only when 
<br />
interpreted as quasi-signs. This is the level of formal causation much 
<br />
connected with chemistry and the level of reflexes in the body.
<br />
d)      The semiotic level belonging to all living systems (biosemiotics) 
<br />
and is much connected with biology. The living systems are the basis of 
<br />
true triadic semiosis -- producing signification spheres in sign games. 
<br />
This level encompasses the work of Uexküll (1934) and ethologists such as 
<br />
Lorenz (1970-1971, 1973) and Tinbergen (1973) within a broad semiotic 
<br />
framework. This is the level where unconscious final causation dominates.
<br />
e)      The level of conscious languaging systems (language games, 
<br />
arguments) is so far occupied only by the social realm of humans and their 
<br />
culture. Here final causation is full-blown in self-consciousness.
<br />
Sign-making is thus immanent in nature, but manifest only in full triadic 
<br />
semiosis within autopoietic living systems. The informational level is seen 
<br />
as intermedial between the physical world of energy, matter and forces and 
<br />
the semiotic world.
<br />
When information theory attempts to encompass the areas of meaning and 
<br />
semantics, it also surpasses and destroys the semiotic threshold by 
<br />
blurring the difference between informational and semiotic processes, and 
<br />
thereby between mechanical signal manipulating (or quasi-semiotic systems) 
<br />
and living systems. This produces all sorts of simplistic theories about 
<br />
intelligences that are unable to account for the cognitive processes unique 
<br />
to embodied living systems, not to mention those unique to conscious, 
<br />
socio-linguistic systems.
<br />
I argue that sign-making is the threshold between cybernetics and 
<br />
semiotics. The whole subject area of cybernetic information theory is 
<br />
therefore quasi-semiotic.
<br />
Beneath this is the physico-chemical level that is generally best described 
<br />
in terms of energy, matter, and causality by natural forces (Secondness) 
<br />
but over the long term does have Thirdness processes that develop &#x201c;natural 
<br />
law&#x201d; through symmetry-breaking and habit-formation in evolution.
<br />
Maturana and Varela in their theory of autopoiesis do not utilize the word 
<br />
&#x201c;information&#x201d; when cognition is understood from the observing autopoietic 
<br />
system. Nothing is transferred from the environment to the living system 
<br />
that can be designated as meaningful information. But they admit that when 
<br />
one observes from the outside, it appears that the system has obtained 
<br />
information. In other words, information is created inside the autopoietic 
<br />
system as formal causation when it receives a disturbance that it is 
<br />
prepared for as a species through the creation of a structural coupling. 
<br />
This is all on the level of reflex. On the next level, ethologists would 
<br />
claim it had an instinctual perception, and that sign stimuli elicited an 
<br />
Innate Release Mechanism (IRM) that caused a preprogrammed instinctive 
<br />
behavior. From a Cybersemiotic perspective, one can view autopoiesis as a 
<br />
necessary condition for differences in the environment to become meaningful 
<br />
signs through the process of semiosis.
<br />
Through biosemiotics, cybersemiotics is introducing the concept of meaning 
<br />
to science. A new aspect is added to biology. Thus we have a framework 
<br />
theory, but we do keep the difference between the levels but unite standard 
<br />
science with cybernetic information theory, semiotics and the level of 
<br />
human linguistic meaning in a common framework, thus paving the way for a 
<br />
true Third Culture that encompasses science, humanities and social sciences.

<br />
Questions:
<br />
1.      Can&#x2019;t we avoid the metaphysics?
<br />
2.      Is a theory of levels really necessary?
<br />
3.      Aren&#x2019;t we supposed to keep mind and meaning out of scientific 
<br />
theories?
<br />
4.      Information science is supposed to explain life in a scientific way 
<br />
that avoids theories of meaning. Thus doesn&#x2019;t biosemiotics destroy the 
<br />
whole &#x2018;plot&#x2019; of information science?
<br />
5.      Can&#x2019;t we use other theories of mind and consciousness, for instance 
<br />
from cognitive science or quantum consciousness, to avoid the idea 
<br />
of  subjectivity in nature?
<br />
6.      Is final causation a scientific concept?
<br />
7.      Is it possible to define science on another basis than the 
<br />
mechanistic?
<br />
8.      If we have given up the belief in a universal mechanistic science 
<br />
shouldn&#x2019;t we then avoid grand schemes like the intended her   as they are 
<br />
unscientific in their base.
<br />
9.      The great thing about natural science is that physics, chemistry 
<br />
and biology can be seen under one type of explanatory law system. Why 
<br />
destroy that?
