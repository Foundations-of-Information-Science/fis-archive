                <p>
                    Dear FISers and Micheal, Rafael and Gordana,
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>In reply to your posting Michael:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;I am sympathetic to your view since most of us are raised under the same
                    <br />
                    evangelisation. As physicist I believed in realism for a long, long time -
                    <br />
                    seduced (?) by my tutors - but when I turned to computer science in the late
                    <br />
                    1960-ties I simple could make this easily come by view to work any more. If
                    <br />
                    you take reality to be pre-given and common to all people you cannot simply
                    <br />
                    develop computer software that people find useful - on the contrary you
                    <br />
                    risked to fail. Then I started to look for the reasons for the different
                    <br />
                    perspectives of the world - and finally found it in the tacit assumptions
                    <br />
                    behind the classical Newtonian paradigm. People see the world differently
                    <br />
                    and do it for good (and useful) reasons -- to my mind the idea of knowing a
                    <br />
                    single and common world is a misconception caused by the Biblical myths.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an essential reason, I believe, why nearly all physical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists are realists. There would be no physical science without
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; realism.
                    </em><br />
                    According to my claim you are in part right since according to SOA the
                    <br />
                    physical/non-physical (i.e., real/non-real) is non-scientific because of
                    <br />
                    undecidabiliy. But in this situation &quot;physics&quot; turn into
                    <br />
                    a theory of knowledge, where the phenomena we normally call physical - are
                    <br />
                    renamed to perceptual stablities (in time). So there is still a science even
                    <br />
                    without the term &quot;realism&quot; namely the &quot;theory of stable phenomena&quot; - that
                    <br />
                    would then count as &quot;physics&quot;
                    <br />
                    I think the main reason for realism is tradition. Our beliefs are still so
                    <br />
                    anchored in language and the Christian creation myths - there is one God and
                    <br />
                    his unary creation - and therefore one world. A prerequisite for all of us
                    <br />
                    to know the &quot;same&quot; world is that our perceptual apparatuses are &quot;fairly&quot;
                    <br />
                    similar. This is a bold assumption - and misleading unfortunately. Gordana
                    <br />
                    says: &quot;The same world might be for some other animal (say cephalopoda) very
                    <br />
                    much different - in terms of inputs and outputs as well as information
                    <br />
                    processing mechanisms, memory, reaction patterns... Who knows what
                    <br />
                    cephalopoda would say the &quot;real world&quot; looks like? &quot; Well, this saying
                    <br />
                    applies to any living. I do not know your experience - and you do not know
                    <br />
                    mine but for sure they are different, we must at least proceed from this
                    <br />
                    assumption.
                    <br />
                    Maybe Demokritos was the first realist - and as such guided by the creation
                    <br />
                    myths - and then it all went on - Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Einstein - the
                    <br />
                    spell of tradition is very strong and QM has not yet succeded in changing
                    <br />
                    this situation.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps the most fundamental assumption upon which physical science depends
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the conviction that all of us are imbedded in the same, objective
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical reality.
                    </em><br />
                    Yes - but objective, physical and reality has become buzz-word in a physical
                    <br />
                    science that is dedicated to detached observation (and therefore outside) as
                    <br />
                    the only mean of confirmation. My &quot;realist-riddle&quot; question is an attempt to
                    <br />
                    make us wake up from this dogmatic slumber. There is so much else to know
                    <br />
                    about but perceptual stabilities.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand that one cannot prove this deductively, but the inductive
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence seems, to most of us, to be overwhelming. From the very
                        beginning
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physical science, through to the present, all of our scientific
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; accomplishments rely on a description of nature that is observer
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent.
                    </em><br />
                    After Gï¿½del we know that we cannot prove anything - in its classical sense.
                    <br />
                    Realism cannot be proved or disproved and neither can anti-realism (which is
                    <br />
                    a collection word for all -isms that apposes all forms of realism) - but the
                    <br />
                    point is that this (and similar) distinctions must be aborted for science to
                    <br />
                    become scientific. Science cannot deal with questions that are undecidable -
                    <br />
                    this is the point. And when one take such a conclusion for useful (not
                    <br />
                    true!) the troublesome dualism of modern science - implodes into monism,
                    <br />
                    that is to say one domain of knowing - experience. And since experience is
                    <br />
                    personal one must take off the build-up of science from the individuals
                    <br />
                    subjective experience. This is why we must apply a Subject-Oriented Approach
                    <br />
                    rather than a Object-Oriented one. &quot;Physics&quot; works very well from the
                    <br />
                    internalist's perspective - as a matter of fact even better I assure you.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Weï¿½ve incorporated Gallilean relativity into the fundament of classical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics. All the classical equations of motion are observer independent.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would there be anything at all left of the physical sciences if we
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;discarded classical mechanics?
                    </em><br />
                    Yes there would. Furthermore the classical equations of motion are not
                    <br />
                    observer-independent. Take for instance F = m*a F is a force abstraction
                    <br />
                    (an analogue to the force of impact we feel when acted upon by diverse
                    <br />
                    phenomena). The magnitude of this impact we can calculate by juxtaposing it
                    <br />
                    to m*a. Mass is a hypothetic property we assign to a visual (thing/particle)
                    <br />
                    impression (audible in QFT) that is mathematically multiplied by the
                    <br />
                    visually observed change of acceleration assigned to this thing/particle.
                    <br />
                    Observer-independent????????
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is exactly the consistency and usefulness of the physical sciences that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; argues, irrefutably, I believe, for the validity of the axioms upon which
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical science depends.
                    </em><br />
                    No, no the wrong way - physics is the result of its foundations - not the
                    <br />
                    proof of the validity of the foundations.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Statistical mechanics, hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, and others cannot
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;stand without classical mechanics.
                    </em><br />
                    I do not agree.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, we physical scientists must adamantly refuse to concede that because
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; realism is not deductively derivable, it might not be correct.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I note that Einstein built both his theories of relativity, special and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; general, on the postulate of observer independence. Should we throw out
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; those extraordinarily valuable and consistent theories because we wish to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; debate the lack of a deductive argument for realism?
                    </em><br />
                <p>They are valuable to natural sciences only. I will repeat myself - they are
                    <br />
                    unfortunately not consistent. We shall not throw them out - we shall revise
                    <br />
                    our theories to make them consistent and more general exactly in the same
                    <br />
                    way the theories of relativity changes the physicists framework of
                    <br />
                    modelling. It is not only physical forces and movements that are relative to
                    <br />
                    the observer - ALL KNOWLEDGE IS RELATIVE TO THE KNOWER (not observer) - this
                    <br />
                    is the base line of subjectivity erected in the SOA framework which is
                    <br />
                    different from the prevailing.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Hamiltonian formalism, Poisson Brackets, etc.) does not imply observer
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;dependence, though some eminent physicists, like Wigner and von Neumann,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;have read it that way.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; The accepted understanding of the wavefunction, Psi, was given in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; early 1920s by Max Born. As you know, If we wish to calculate the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability for each possible measured value of the system we take the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; projection of the eigenfunction for that value on the wave function, then
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculate the inner product with Psi*.
                    </em><br />
                <p>See for yourself - you are talking about PROJECTING your knowledge of
                    <br />
                    particles/wavefunctions UPON the &quot;out-the-ness&quot; to estimate some coming
                    <br />
                    experience of your awareness.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That we are predicting a probability for a measured outcome does not, at
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;all, imply that human consciousness plays any part in the measurement. In
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact, as Hawking, Penrose, and so many other physicists have so carefully
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;calculated, there is every reason to believe that quantum mechanics
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;described the cosmos billions of years before any humans and their
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious minds existed.
                    </em><br />
                <p>I do not agree - to take measurements and be conscious are almost
                    <br />
                    identical - let be that some instruments eventually are made of hardware for
                    <br />
                    the sake of stability.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In general, measurement is information exchange between two separate
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical objects. Neither object need be human, of course.
                    </em><br />
                <p>No - but the process of information exchange presumes an observer - don't
                    <br />
                    you agree.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The canonical model for a measurement that transfers one bit of information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the bi-level atom located along one arm of the Stern-Gerlach apparatus
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;described in 1978 (Physics Reports) by Scully, Shea, and McCullen. When a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;spinning molecule collides with the bi-level atom, a single quantum of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;energy is transferred to the atom. This is a real, physical, energetic
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;signal that carries information about the change in energy of the molecule
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the atom. Since energy is always conserved, the energy jump in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;detector atom always records the exact information about the change in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;energy of the molecule.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Yes, this is a both beautiful and useful model we use to describe
                    <br />
                    information exchange in physics - but we must not be mislead to take it for
                    <br />
                    real. Real and physical are simply words (and misleading unfortunately).
                    <br />
                    Classical physics works very well under the assumtion human perception works
                    <br />
                    as a binocular - i.e., is involved in linear mapping. This is far to simple
                    <br />
                    an assumtion - human perception is best charachterised by adaptiveness - not
                    <br />
                    invariance.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One may, of course, still ask how human beings are able to observe
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of our shared physical reality.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Yes and this was the point with my presention of the &quot;realists dilemma&quot; -
                    <br />
                    and asking for a solution. But up till now nobody has proposed one.
                    <br />
                    Nevertheless I hope we can deepen the discussion about the misunderstood
                    <br />
                    human's capacity of perception outgoing from these remarks.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Iï¿½m convinced that at the most basic level of human percepta, more
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamental than learned, or perhaps innate, shapes and objects, we all
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;look at the same pattern of minute color specks and see (and describe) the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;same specks. The key here is to look only for each speck of color, as one
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;might do to a pointillist painting by Signac, say, ignoring any impression
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of physical objects that the artist may have portrayed. If necessary,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientists could employ such a basic technique to insure that the pattern
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;which carries information about results of a measurement (like the face of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;an ammeter, for instance) really is observer independent. Iï¿½m convinced
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there are no cultually-inculcated tendencies at this most basic
                        level.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Personally I think we have good evidence to assume there is a reality
                    <br />
                    (probably common) behind the stable entities of our perception
                    <br />
                    - BUT THIS SHOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY CONCLUSION DRAWN BY A MATURE SCIENCE
                    <br />
                    --- AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED AT THE OUTSET. IN THE LATTER
                    <br />
                    CASE THE &quot;REALITY&quot;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;CONCEPTION CAN NEITHER BE REFUTED - OR NEITHER CONFIRMED.
                    <br />
                <p>This bring me to protest against Rafael's oversimplification: &quot;Declarations
                    <br />
                    of faiths are declarations of faith. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot; One faith
                    <br />
                    (model) can be more useful but another model - and this is really something
                    <br />
                    more - some models are more useful because they better predict coming
                    <br />
                    experience. And some faiths must be dismissed from scientific discussions
                    <br />
                    because they cannot be fitted into a decision procedure.
                    <br />
                    The poverty of reductionism is not a povery of its methodology - but the way
                    <br />
                    we try to apply it in the hope to find some ultimate explanation is a sign
                    <br />
                    of poverty. The latter quest is in vain - in all knowledge discourses. In
                    <br />
                    the case we will avoid the endless regression (to bring out an answer) - we
                    <br />
                    must abort the endless looping by using our personal will (to bring out
                    <br />
                    one). No God, Evolution or Mathematics can assist us in provide an end
                    <br />
                    criterion in that matter. It seems our imagination is endless - but not the
                    <br />
                    time we have at our disposal. Therefore we must cut of the regression - at a
                    <br />
                    level specified by usefulness, which in turn depends on the goal we have in
                    <br />
                    mind. THEREFORE WE MUST FIRST OF ALL ASK AS TO WHETHER A SPECIFIC GOAL IS
                    <br />
                    REACHABLE - OR IF A CERTAIN DECISION CAN BE MADE AND HOW - EVEN BEFORE WE
                    <br />
                    ENTER UPON THE QUEST. In that view Quine's proposal of a pursuit of truth
                    <br />
                    is vainly.
