<br />
Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>I am following our discussion already a while without interfering.
<br />
After reading again about 100 pages of discussion 
<br />
I would like to make the following remarks:
<br />
<p>We should never forget in our discussion about basic problems that
<br />
the information concept has a very solid fundament in physics,
<br />
communication, computers, internet etc.. We are living in an
<br />
information society and several concepts are simply fixed
<br />
already they cannot be traded freely.
<br />
Anybody who forgets all this will be like Antaeus.
<br />
Let me mention a few concepts which as I believe should not be
<br />
thrown away lightheartly:
<br />
<p>- information is a binary relation between a sender and a receiver
<br />
(I cannot understand why several FISers like to consider information as 
<br />
a property of a system itself, like mass, energy, momentum in physics.
<br />
To me and I believe to any engineer,
<br />
information is binary as interaction in physics it is a relation between
<br />
two things),
<br />
<p>- flow of information between sender and receiver is connected
<br />
with decrease of uncertainty (why we should give up such an
<br />
extremely fruitful concept due to Shannon. Communication networks
<br />
and by the way also our internet discussion would break down.
<br />
We should not ignore the reality of communication based on this).
<br />
<p>- information flow is connected with entropy flow, this is expressed
<br />
by the Boltzmann Shannon formulae.
<br />
(Entropy in physics is one of the fundaments of any physical theory
<br />
the number of technical applications from cars to refrigerators are
<br />
uncountable).
<br />
<p>Of course there many other aspects which are more or less fixed by
<br />
practice.
<br />
<p>To me the unsolved problems are:
<br />
<p>- what is the exact relation between physical entropy and information
<br />
entropy (there were very interesting remarks by Shu-Kun Lee on this
<br />
L = I + S but things are much more complicated, by the way also
<br />
the information content relation to stability is not a clear concept).
<br />
<p>- is there any measure of the meaning of a message (this is indead
<br />
a very complicated question, Shannons measure expresses clearly
<br />
only the quantity not the meaning)
<br />
<p>- the specific properties of information in biological/social systems
<br />
<p>- selforganization of information processing systems in the
<br />
evolution of life.
<br />
<p>By the way to me information is not a physical concept, it is not
<br />
contained in the axioma of physics. There was no information before the
<br />
first living system appeared on earth and as far as I see information
<br />
processing is always at least indirectly connected with biological
<br />
social technical systems.
<br />
It would be very interesting for me to learn about an 
<br />
information processing system absolutely independent from life.
<br />
<p>Summarizing I thing this discussion is extremely inspiring and useful
<br />
but sometimes we have to come back to our earth.
<br />
<p>Regards
<br />
Werner Ebeling
