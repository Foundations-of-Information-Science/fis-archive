<p>
Dear Aleks, and All,
<br />
<p>Aleks has raised some issues of great interest to philosophers of science. 
<br />
I thank him for raising them.  Here are some brief responses, off the cuff. 
<br />
They may expose my ignorance more than they enlighten, but that is useful to 
<br />
me.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Entropy is an interesting example of attempted consilience. Entropy was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shown to correspond to thermodynamics for models of molecules. Entropy in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sense of quantifying dispersion proved useful for any kind of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical model. However, if entropy can be defined for a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model, it doesn't imply that the laws of thermodynamics will apply to that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model. In that sense, we have consilience in the notion of &quot;dispersion&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not consilience of the notion of &quot;the arrow of time&quot;. Since entropy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connected with both notions, there is mess. The solution is to split 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;arrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time&quot; entropy and &quot;dispersion&quot;.
</em><br />
<p>Yes, it seems plausible that extension of a concept to a new situation does 
<br />
not imply that the associated laws will also apply to the new situation.  So 
<br />
why assume that the arrow of time is tied to the arrow of entropy?  Why 
<br />
assume that the arrow of dispersion has anything to do with time?  I gather 
<br />
this is what you are saying here, Aleks.  In which case, I agree 
<br />
wholeheartedly.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Bell's theorem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't using Bell's theorem as an example of consilience dangerous, as it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loaded with assumptions? See for example: Karl Hess and Walter Philipp. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible loophole in the theorem of Bell. PNAS. vol. 98. no. 25. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 14224-14227
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; December 4, 2001. Briefly, Bell's theorem indicates that if there are two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separated measurement stations measure an entangled pair of particles,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moving one station will influence the readings on the second station. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is inconsistent with the view that the particles can be measured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently. Operators are just one way of explaining this, often quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusing. But you get the same effect if you measure the waving of water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a pond with your hands: if you move one hand in the pond, the waves at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second hand will be affected. But note that the water in the pond can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modelled causally. Would you want to model the pond with quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operators?
</em><br />
<p>Alice measures the spin of one electron in an entangled pairs of electrons, 
<br />
and Bob measures the spin of the second electron.  Each controls the 
<br />
measurement setting (the orientation of the Stern-Gerlach magnet), but not 
<br />
the outcome of the measurement ('up' or 'down').  There is nothing that Bob 
<br />
sees that tells him what measurement setting Alice has chosen.  The 
<br />
conclusion that Alice's choice affects the outcomes that Bob sees cannot be 
<br />
derived from quantum theory--it is only derived from the assumption that 
<br />
there exist hidden variables, and this assumption leads to false 
<br />
predictions, and therefore should be rejected.  That is Bell's argument.
<br />
<p>The stuff about loopholes concerns ways in which hidden variable can be 
<br />
saved from refutation.  Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that there 
<br />
are such loopholes, and the prediction is blocked. Then hidden variable 
<br />
theory is saved from a false consilience, and ends up with no consilience at 
<br />
all.
<br />
<p>In the meantime, quantum mechanics is making true predictions, and is 
<br />
achieving genuine consiliences.  The loophole program, if successful, is not 
<br />
doing very much by way of resuscitating hidden variable theories.  So, why 
<br />
not concede that quantum mechanics is the better theory.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Empirical test
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We might be trying to be too discriminating for our own good here. There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no such thing as a definitive test, there is no such thing as definitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consilience. Consilience is just an increase in experimental support for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory outside the scope for which the theory was originally created. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't mean that the theory is the best, or unquestionably true. It's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an increase of support and of generality. I may appear like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instrumentalist, but I'm not. There are many things one doesn't question,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and they form the foundation for realism. Each concept can be truth today
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and theory tomorrow. When you instrumentalistically move one foot, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs to be on realistic solid ground, just for that moment.
</em><br />
<p>Agreed.  There is no such thing as a definitive test, there is no such thing 
<br />
as definitive
<br />
consilience. Consilience is just an increase in experimental support for a 
<br />
theory outside the scope for which the theory was originally created.   And 
<br />
it doesn't mean that the theory is unquestionably true.  But it may mean 
<br />
that the theory is the best of the rival theories currently on the table.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. Kepler and Newton
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have enjoyed Malcolm's example very much: consilience is about explicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equality, not just implicit equality. Of course, if we don't allow for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicit *approximate* equality, we might not be able to apply consilience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in other domains. Even in physics, for that matter, approximate equality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used, as long as it is not systematically biased. For a real-life example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take a look at &quot;SEARCH FOR A STANDARD EXPLANATION OF THE PIONEER ANOMALY&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arXiv:gr-qc/0107022: the Pioneer probes seem to be systematically slowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down as they exit the solar system. One of the tongue-in-cheek comments on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internet forums about this phenomenon is &quot;It's bumping against the crystal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sphere with the stars painted on it.&quot; True equality is only in the domain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pure mathematics.
</em><br />
<p>Agreed.  True equality is only in the domain of pure mathematics.  That is 
<br />
also true in the Kepler example.  Newton argued that Kepler's third law, 
<br />
which says that the ratio of the mean radius cubed to the period squared is 
<br />
the same for every planet, supported his theory of gravitation.  This is 
<br />
because the ratio of the mean radius cubed to the period squared for each 
<br />
planet is approximately equal to the mass of the sun according to Newton's 
<br />
theory, so the measurements are approximately equal because they are 
<br />
approximate measurements of the same quantity.   If Kepler's third law is 
<br />
exactly true, then Newton would have 6 independent measurements of the sun's 
<br />
mass that agree exactly.  But Newton knew that Kepler's law is false, not 
<br />
merely because the numbers did not agree exactly, but also because he could 
<br />
only derive the law by assuming that the planets were &quot;test particles&quot; with 
<br />
infinitely small mass.  This enabled Newton to correct the measurements by 
<br />
taking account of independent estimates of the masses of the planets.  After 
<br />
this correction, the agreement was better, but still not perfect. 
<br />
Nevertheless, the agreement was impressive.  It did support Newton's theory 
<br />
(if we deny this, then we would have to conclude that no scientific theory 
<br />
are supported by the evidence any better than any rival theory).
<br />
<p>For details of this example, see:

<br />
