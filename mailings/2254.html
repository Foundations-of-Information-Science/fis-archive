                    Dear colleagues,

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers, surreal numbers) and the Kantian meltdown of rational philosophy.
                    </em><br />
                <p>In my view, what changed dramatically was not only the relationship with
                    <br />
                    numbers but, above all, the way to &quot;validate&quot; knowledge: from &quot;disputatio&quot;
                    <br />
                    to &quot;experimentatio&quot; (rhetorics becoming subsidiary to experimental
                    <br />
                    procedures--the big point of the scientific revolution). This point is not
                    <br />
                    trivial concerning our nascent field, as quite many parties disregard any
                    <br />
                    empirical grounding (abandoning the quest for &quot;facts&quot; to ingrain their
                    <br />
                    theoretical-doctrinary views). Given that, potentially, fis also implies a
                    <br />
                    new vision on info and knowledge, and the contemporary role of sciences at
                    <br />
                    the social realm, this may lead to fine-tune our views on what
                    <br />
                    thought-collectives actually do... in any case, the &quot;mystification of

                    numbers&quot; looks a very good point for future discussions.

                    </em><br />
                <p>I have had to drop very interesting paragraphs, rather unjustly, but
                    <br />
                    perhaps this is the right place to point at a relative absence: that the
                    <br />
                    whole bionetwork deals basically with self-production activities. The cell,
                    <br />
                    as Changeux put it, is but &quot;an enormous factory&quot; devoted to the production
                    <br />
                    of molecular machines. In the 70's it was argumented under the label of
                    <br />
                    &quot;AUTOPIESIS&quot; by Maturana and Varela, unfortunately they did not continue
                    <br />
                    the integration of new biomolecular facts and their synthesis was left
                    <br />
                    suffering the usual &quot;premature closure&quot; ailment, and somehow pretentious
                    <br />
                    and empty for our times. Thus, to continue with Jerry's taxonomy, the
                    <br />
                    problem is that the self-production network is a mere label for an enormous
                    <br />
                    landscape of molecular interactions and processes of quite a heterogeneous
                    <br />
                    nature. Let me take home the term &quot;molecular landscape&quot;.

                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As noted in FIS post number II, the mathematical of bionetworks depends on

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the mathematics of atomic numbers and chemical combinations is deeply

                <p>Excellent paragraphs! Perhaps I would encapsulate another conclusion too:
                    <br />
                    the whole transformations in the molecular landscapes within a cell are
                    <br />
                    demanding a vast collaboration of disciplinary fields which have to be
                    <br />
                    guided by new integrative abstractions.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept of atomic numbers and is EXCLUDED by the simple arithmetic rules!

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;... &quot;recognition&quot; as a form of cognition does not suggest the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;process of some sort or another.
                    </em><br />
                <p>Again I have dropped a lot of text --- well, maybe I am misunderstanding
                    <br />
                    the above, but if we retake the molecular landscape vision, or better, if
                    <br />
                    we transport ourselves in front of a &quot;real&quot; landscape, a beautiful natural
                    <br />
                    scenario, could we say about our verbal/scientific reports that &quot;it is a
                    <br />
                    logical process of some sort of another.&quot; Nope. We would be forced to
                    <br />
                    heterogeneous descriptions, implying terribly different logics (even
                    <br />
                    &quot;pictorial&quot; ones).
                    <br />
                <p>To argue more on scientific matters, the logical schemes that work so well
                    <br />
                    in the &quot;artificial&quot; are based on a separation from the world of chemical
                    <br />
                    happenstance. Think on computers. Their design precludes the participation
                    <br />
                    of chemical processes and relies on solid state transistors that implement
                    <br />
                    electrically boolean networks. The topology of the implied connections is
                    <br />
                    awfully complex (the wiring of the LSI circuits, basically devoted to
                    <br />
                    interconnect masses of transistors through metallic bonding). In the
                    <br />
                    bionetwork self-production scheme, everything is connected potentially with
                    <br />
                    everything (around different 5.000 molecular types in a minimalist cell),
                    <br />
                    and the whole is capable to advance towards culminating a reproduction
                    <br />
                    cycle due to the &quot;specificity&quot; of compounds, each one being endowed with
                    <br />
                    &quot;molecular recognition&quot; capabilities. If we drop the specificity of
                    <br />
                    molecular recognition events, the cell disappears into a blob of gel.

                    <br />
                    texts these days are a very elegant contribution too.

                    </em><br />
                <p>Necessary, but not sufficient ---atomic numbers are working in Mars, or the
                    <br />
                    Moon too... obviously no life there. Thus the conditions of the living
                    <br />
                    organization are situated far above atomic numbers --and my opinion is that
                    <br />
                    the origins of life is a monumentally unsolved scientific question
                    <br />
                    (curiously, some of Steve's points on science in the US may be taken the
                    <br />
                    other way around for the socio-political conditions in most European and
                    <br />
                    Asian countries).

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;basis of size?
                    </em><br />
                <p>A change in view is needed. We are too dominated by ways of thinking that
                    <br />
                    put together the schemes of the artificial and of the natural ---under the
                    <br />
                    guidance of the former. The &quot;semantic metabolism&quot;, to recreate an idea of
                    <br />
                    late Tom Stonier (exposed in this very list in the 90's, one of his last
                    <br />
                    writings!), occurs in our selves too; and it does not hinge on detached
                    <br />
                    processing but on &quot;ingestion of signals&quot;, which alter the ongoing
                    <br />
                    relationships of cellular production / degradation of enzymes and proteins,
                    <br />
                    the advancement of cell cycles and checkpoints in a variety of tissues, of
                    <br />
                    neurotransmitters, modulators and neurohormones... the embodiment of our
                    <br />
                    perplexification capabilities. We are not &quot;systems&quot;, we have not
                    <br />
                    &quot;components&quot;, we do not perform detached &quot;information
                    <br />
                    processing&quot;... (the usage of &quot;systems biology&quot; in contemporary
                    <br />
                    bioinformatics is really an oxymoron).
                    <br />
                <p>Unfortunately I do not have the alternative wording for what occurs along
                    <br />
                    the bioinformational paths of adaptability, and am merely using the
                    <br />
                    &quot;processual&quot; term applied to life cycles (that which occurs when cells and
                    <br />
                    organisms &quot;ingest&quot; or &quot;abduce&quot; environmental &quot;affordances&quot;). Shouldn't
                    we
                    <br />
                    aspire to produce elegant terms and abstractions on how life thrives on
                    <br />
                    information? Aren't they badly needed?
