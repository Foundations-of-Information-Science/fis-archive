THE LANGUAGE OF CELLS
<br />

<br />
<p>1. Introduction: Positional versus Compositional Information
<br />
<p>The notion of a &quot;language&quot; of cells does not look consistent in relation
<br />
with the standard views of Information Theory applied to biology. Although
<br />
Shannon and Wiener (1948) distinguished between discrete, continuous, and
<br />
mixed information sources, the standard application of their ideas to the
<br />
biology of the cell has been heavily influenced by the DNA and RNA
<br />
sequential structure, and only the discrete-positional case has been
<br />
traditionally considered (e.g., Gatlin, 1972). As a consequence, the lack
<br />
of distinction between &quot;positional&quot; and &quot;compositional&quot; forms of
<br />
information and the subsequent neglect of the latter--we are going to argue
<br />
here--have implied an analytical dead-end concerning the possibilities of
<br />
elucidating formal mechanisms of cellular languages.
<br />
<p>In biology and in human to human communication, the assumed preconditions
<br />
for information transmission, and for any workable language, refer to
<br />
sequences of messages containing combinations of symbols which will be
<br />
accepted (or emitted, or read, or transmitted, or deciphered) always
<br />
following a positional order. Therefore, Shannon's formula appears as the
<br />
natural way of measuring the average combinatory content of these messages,
<br />
and of establishing their relative index of surprise, in order to design
<br />
appropriate channels, codes, etc. A workable language can be created,
<br />
subsequently, as a series of grammatical (Markovian) rules to abide by when
<br />
connecting successive positional messages comprised within the dictionary
<br />
scope of the language.
<br />
<p>However, one can point at a number of instances in natural and social
<br />
communication where symbols are used in a rather different way. Instead of
<br />
a &quot;positional&quot; context, a &quot;compositional&quot; one is the case. In this
<br />
alternative context, messages are exchanged as presences or absences of
<br />
symbols which have been accumulated upon predetermined sets of objects. No
<br />
meaningful positional relationships among the objects within the set or
<br />
among the symbols accumulated upon the objects are assumed. For example,
<br />
several glasses on a tray may contain a variable number of different
<br />
symbolic items (ice cubes, soda, vermouth, olives, cherries). The set of
<br />
glasses on the tray become the message, each glass being an individual
<br />
object that accumulates several symbols which precisely configure it as a
<br />
distinguishable object. Communication among two subjects could be
<br />
established by the exchange of trays, with variable number of glasses and
<br />
variable contents within them. Theoretically, that messages might be
<br />
reliably distinguished and transmitted by this method &quot;of concurrent
<br />
processing of discrete states of media&quot; has been postulated by Karl
<br />
Javorszky (1996). A whole body of partitional calculus (or granularity
<br />
algebra) has been envisioned by this author (Javorszky, 1995).
<br />
<p>More reasonable examples of the compositional way of information exchanges
<br />
may be found in the communicational use of colors, odors and tastes by
<br />
individual organisms; also in social insects' pheromones; and anecdotally
<br />
in the etiquette &quot;language of flowers&quot;; and perhaps within musical
<br />
compositions and within the formative frequencies of vowels and consonants
<br />
of our own spoken languages as well. The &quot;language of cells&quot;, we will
<br />
discuss here, may be one of the most interesting instances of communication
<br />
by means of such compositional tools; and it has been the forerunner of any
<br />
further means of biological communication.
<br />
Marshall Mc Luhan's famous dictum &quot;the medium is the message&quot; and the
<br />
particular disdain this author showed about Shannon's information theory
<br />
(Mc Luhan, 1968) are worth be remembered when considering this fundamental
<br />
distinction between positional and compositional forms of information
<br />
exchange.
<br />
<p><p>2. Analyzing a Compositional Message
<br />
<p>When receiving a compositional message encrusted upon a set of N elements,
<br />
there is very little a subject can do: just counting the presence of the
<br />
different symbols on each element of the set. Hence the elements can be
<br />
grouped in homogeneous classes of overlapping or non-overlapping nature
<br />
(each class is defined by the presence of a specific symbol, and it
<br />
actually demarcates a partition of the set N). After the classes defined by
<br />
single symbols, the more complex coincidences of combinations of symbols
<br />
(class overlaps) among the elements can be counted. It can be easily proved
<br />
that all the possible countings of symbolic presences among the N elements
<br />
of the set, in the first case of linear or one-dimensional partitions for
<br />
single symbols, conduce to the whole set of partitions of N, known as E(N)
<br />
(Javorszky, 1995). Whereas the coincidences or overlaps of successive
<br />
combinations of two, three, four symbols, etc., can be considered as second
<br />
order partitions, third order, fourth order ones, etc.--E2(N), E3(N),
<br />
E4(N)...
<br />
<p>Mathematically, partitions are a very straight concept: the additive
<br />
decompositions of natural numbers. For instance, the set { (5), (4,1),
<br />
(3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1) } represents the whole
<br />
onedimensional partitions of 5. By adhering to this mathematical treatment,
<br />
one can use the well-known partitional properties of numbers to discuss the
<br />
most probable logical states of a compositional message encrusted upon the
<br />
elements of the set N.
<br />
<p>The set of partitions E(N) can be transformed right away into a
<br />
probability body. The probability of any state of the set to exist as is
<br />
described by a specific partition is given by the relative frequency of
<br />
this partition among all partitions. For instance, on E(5) the probability
<br />
is
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/7     - for states (5), (2,1,1,1) and (1,1,1,1,1) each,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2/7     - for states with either 2 or 3 summands each,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15/20   - for any summand to be an odd number.
<br />
<p>Kmax is that number (1..n &lt; N) which generates the most numerous set of
<br />
partitions of N into k summands. In this most probable partitional state,
<br />
the set shows Kmax distinct summands with respect to a one-describing
<br />
dimension. In the case of E (5), there is a Kmax shared both by 2 and 3.
<br />
<p>Heuristically, it appears that a compositional message can be univocally
<br />
described by its corresponding &quot;trace&quot; of unidimensional partitions
<br />
(Javorszky, 1996), if a few additional statistical measures that act as a
<br />
sort of context or shared background in the communicational process have
<br />
been previously established: most probable message length, ratio of
<br />
symbols/elements, structural depth, shallowness, etc. Then the use of
<br />
partitions of further order (second, third, etc.) becomes redundant--and
<br />
its inclusion would notably complicate the mathematical description of the
<br />
message.
<br />
<p>Additionally, the Kmax. dimension of every property or symbolic presence
<br />
may be used as an origin or natural cannon to which the respective
<br />
deviations of successive messages can refer. This further simplifies the
<br />
partitional &quot;trace&quot; describing a specific message in the context of an
<br />
ongoing communication process.
<br />
<p>Karl Javorszky (1996) has argued that an efficient communication procedure,
<br />
massively parallel, can be built around such minimized partitional traces
<br />
or message simplifications. It seems to work particularly well with data
<br />
sets of a moderate size, which are preferably prestructured and come in a
<br />
quasi continuous stream, so that the number of possible symbols is always
<br />
kept rather finite--although symbols might come from an infinite multitude,
<br />
there should be a relatively small collection of distinguishing items
<br />
employed at the communicational session, and their group relations should
<br />
not generate a cardinality overstatement symbols/elements above a certain
<br />
limit.
<br />
In the extent that Javorszky4s estimates are correct, the overall capacity
<br />
of a compositional channel making use of discrete states of media can be
<br />
generically expressed as
<br />
<p>T(N) = E(N) exp ln E(N),
<br />
<p>understanding T(N) as the number of different logical states which can be
<br />
distinguished by means of collections of symbols put on the elements of the
<br />
set N -only non-redundant states are counted, for redundant symbol groups
<br />
can always substitute by single symbols, coalescing into a unique logical
<br />
state. E (N) is the already mentioned number of partitions of the set N.
<br />
<p>Calculating the respective probabilities and taking logarithms, one could
<br />
obtain an expression in bits for the compositional-channel capacity (or the
<br />
entropy of a compositional information-source) somehow paralleling the
<br />
famous Shannonian entropy.
<br />
<p>It is also interesting the comparison between T(N) and the strictly
<br />
positional use of the same elements of the set N in a combinatory way
<br />
(which, in principle, should provide a total of N! different messages or
<br />
logical states). In this comparison, T(N) yields a larger number of logical
<br />
states than N! for values of N in between 31 and 95, with a maximum around
<br />
63-64. However, for N = 12, the number of combinations N! reaches a maximum
<br />
with respect to T(N).
<br />
<p>Seemingly, several parameters of the genetic code would correspond with
<br />
such max./min. extremes that characterize the compositional-positional
<br />
interrelationship (see Javorszky, 1995, for detailed expression of all
<br />
these formulae and calculations).
<br />
<p><p>3. A Partitional Approach to Cellular Communication
<br />
<p>How can the above compositional considerations be applied to the analysis
<br />
of inter- and intra-cellular processes? Instead of DNA sequences, it seems
<br />
that the natural target of this new approach should be the &quot;mysterious&quot;
<br />
processing operations performed by the cellular signaling system.
<br />
<p>The basic idea to play with is that any array (sample) of chemical
<br />
compositions detected by the set of cellular receptors may be recast as a
<br />
partitional state, for we may consider that it has been obtained by
<br />
distinguishing the presence of a series of specific chemical signs within
<br />
an hypothetical set of N elements or receptor complexes--it is a transient
<br />
message coming from the environment through an ongoing compositional
<br />
communication process.
<br />
<p>Then, an immediate question arises. Could the system of receptors,
<br />
membrane-bound enzyme and protein complexes, second messengers, and the
<br />
dedicated kinase and phosphatase chains, be understood as an abstract
<br />
partitional processing-system capable of extracting the minimized &quot;trace&quot;
<br />
or relative information differences within the stream of incoming
<br />
compositional messages and physically transport these differences down to
<br />
final effectors at the nucleus, cytoplasm, or membrane? That's the basic
<br />
hypothesis these two authors are presently trying to explore.
<br />
<p>If (and what a big &quot;if&quot;) cells would make use of formal tools of
<br />
partitional nature in their management by means of the cellular signaling
<br />
system of the compositional messages they receive, then the notion of a
<br />
genuine cellular language, with specific dialects for every organismic
<br />
tissue, could be seriously argumented. And perhaps more interesting than
<br />
that, quite a few other bizarre aspects of the signaling system could
<br />
receive some more formal (and simpler) treatment: the cross-talk between
<br />
signaling pathways, the checkpoints relating signaling operations with
<br />
cell-cycle stages, and even the widespread formation of aggregates and
<br />
complexes among signaling components...
<br />
<p>Partitions are very direct formal tools, but at the same time sophisticated
<br />
ones. For instance, if natural numbers are left to &quot;oscillate&quot; and
<br />
simultaneously their corresponding partitions are allowed to grow and
<br />
shrink (Javorszky, 1998), then there emerges a variety of self-organization
<br />
patterns and internally-driven numerical processes which seemingly parallel
<br />
the constructive/degradative aspects so prevalent in biological and social
<br />
occurrences (and even physical ones).
<br />
<p>The studies by Caianiello (1987) on the partitional dynamics inherent of
<br />
monetary systems and the suggestion by one of us (Marijuan, 1998) about the
<br />
&quot;currency&quot; role actually played by the set of second messengers in the
<br />
internal measurement of cellular function might finally be stepping stones
<br />
pointing out in the same direction.
