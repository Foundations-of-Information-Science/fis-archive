                    Replying to Viktoras, then to Igor, and then to SÃ¸ren
                    <br />
                <p>First to Viktoras, who said:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a clear distinction between entropy and reallocation of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;resources both from economical and ecological standpoints?
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I have argued that in non-perfect Second Law dissipation, waste
                    <br />
                    products of better energy quality than heat should also be considered to be
                    <br />
                    'entropic'. They certainly function to reallocate resources, as other
                    <br />
                    systems can (and do) move in and utilize them.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oxygen is produced by plants as waste. However it is consumed by animals
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a resource... Mitochondria wastes lots of energy into their environment
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;still it enables superior systems (cell, organ, body) functioning, moving
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;or sustaining stable temperatural regime. And, once we speak
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;about money flows - taxes play a role of entropy (just paid my taxes, so
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;it really looks like entropy from internalist positions :) ). Still one
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;has to admit that taxes are used by a superior system (country) as a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;resource by redistributing it elsewhere to ensure functioning of its parts
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that otherwise would have not influenced each other.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This kind of thing is just the point of my view above. I believe
                    <br />
                    that ecosystems (and economic systems) are basically formed by primary
                    <br />
                    energy gradients being fragmented by initial poor Second Law dissipators,
                    <br />
                    to be distributed by increasingly better Second Law dissipators in a tree
                    <br />
                    of consumption ending with heat energy being produced from the final
                    <br />
                    dissipators.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;Isn't then entropy and (self)organisation like two sides of a coin ? What
                    <br />
                    is a loss for one system, may easily become a resource or direct gain from
                    <br />
                    a point of view of an embracing superior system. And so on - through many
                    <br />
                    scales and embedded systems in a fractal-like fashion... Best wishes
                    <br />
                    Viktoras -------Original Message-------
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Yes, I agree with Viktoras here. I like to distinguish, however,
                    <br />
                    between the 'purposes' of the two sides. Entropy production finds its
                    <br />
                    meaning in Universal disequilibrium, the result of accelerated expansion of
                    <br />
                    the Universe, while self-organization finds its meaning only locally in the
                    <br />
                    drive for self-realization.

                <p>Now, replying to Igor's:
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stan's views are, however, directly relevant for the discussion of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;sustainability, when he relates entropy production for the Universe and
                        its
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;role as the final cause of violent human behavior:

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Nature. As long as we engage in war while denouncing it at the same
                        time,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am entitled to say that we build in order to burn so that we may rebuild

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;again -- endlessly, with the ultimate result (after our superstructures
                        lie
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the sand like the pyramids) of having satisfactorily contributed to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universal equilibration. ... In warfare we only destroy our own things, in

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;building we destroy everything.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Compared to this views economics, which has been long labeled as

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;science&quot;, appears as a fairy tale. The humanity appears to be doomed
                        between
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;two options: to destroy endlessly its own civilizations or to destroy
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature. I don't believe that world is that much deterministic but I agree
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that Stan's two options are perfectly real and do play part of our own
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;history. Perhaps it is the bias of myself coming from social sciences,
                        that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have to believe that a third option must be allowed to exist - that of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;sustainable living. We may fail to reach this option, but I believe that
                        we
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;should allow it the possibility to exist at least in principle. If social
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;sciences were unable address human problems from that normative, value
                        laden
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective, they would be useless for the society as whole. Therefore, I
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;think that Stan put the problem of sustainability in a strikingly sharp
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective by proposing its alternatives: endless wars or environmental
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;collapses, or both of these at the same time.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The key question that arises quite naturally is whether we as scientists
                        are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;able to find viable, systemic solutions to avoid the latter alternatives.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The immediate second question is, even if scientist are able to find an
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer, will human societies be able to implement it via political
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes and on time to avoid ecological catastrophe (and probable
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;consequent violent conflicts (see for example works of Thomas Homer-Dixon
                        on
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that issue).
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From the discussion so far, it appears that knowledge based economy,
                        for
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasons related to entropy production and its inherent metastability, may
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;not be the solution to the problem. In that sense we moved some steps from
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;where we started. What may be the next step?
                    </em><br />
                <p>SS: I can only say that I have great sympathy with the thrust of Igor's
                    <br />
                    statement here. My formulation should, I think, be taken as the
                    <br />
                    'formulation of a problem' that we seem too readily to generate for
                    <br />
                    ourselves. If there is not some middle ground, &quot;viable&quot; answer to this, we
                    <br />
                    certainly are doomed. As one who always thinks between extremes, I will
                    <br />
                    cite here certain human behaviors that do go to the opposite extreme from
                    <br />
                    careless entropy production. We have had some sects devoted to quietism,
                    <br />
                    to contemplation and to meditation. These are the radical opposites of dam
                    <br />
                    building, football and warfare. It is the midddle ground between these
                    <br />
                    that social scientists and economists must be seeking, it seems to me. The
                    <br />
                    global capitalist system is too far in the direction of entropy production,
                    <br />
                    and seems wedded as well to warfare.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Igor for his good interpretation of my challenging statements

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;worldview where everything had its natural place and over a lifetime would
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;develop from potentiality to actuality and fulfill that place. The purpose
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;was to fulfill you place in this Cosmos, which had always been like this -
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;moved by the immovable mover who had also given his rationality to the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans, so they by induction could recognize the order of things. Now
                        Peirce
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;is able to take over this point of view in his evolutionary semiotic,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;hylozoist view of the world. In a Peircean pan semiotics it is the pure
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;feeling that through evolutionary love manifests as life and mind at the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;same time as the universe is moving towards a state of frozen structure.
                        So,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;here the drive towards heat death creates structures that carry life and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness and therefore love - as I interpret him. As the energy is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;converted to entropy, evolution and the universe will come to a hold.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: OK. SÃ¸ren has spoken of the origin of, and of a subsequent
                    <br />
                    interpretation of finality. In fact there have been yet further, later
                    <br />
                    interpretations -- mine among them (again, I am willing to send to anyone
                    <br />
                    who wants to see it, a diagram outlining my view of the four causes).
                    <br />
                    Finality as a concept does not depend upon the world view wherein it was
                    <br />
                    invented. It has escaped by way of reinterpretation.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What confuses me about Stan's answers is that he on one hand say and writes
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that he is a pansemiotist and on the other hand speak of thermodynamics as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;if he was a physicalist. From a physicalist's point of view it does not
                        make
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense to speak of a final cause outside living beings - for many of them
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;not even with animals. Some even do not believe in free will or that out
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-consciousness has any causal influence on the material world.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I am aware that final cause is not accepted (yet) in ANY
                    modern
                    <br />
                    science -- tant pis! I am bringing it in under the banner of pansemiotics.
                    <br />
                    Semiotics deals with the construction/interpetation of meaning. I believe
                    <br />
                    that the way to bring meaning into science in general is to generalize it
                    <br />
                    from its usage as a human attribute. It could go like this:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{variational principle in physics &lt;- {interactional preferences in
                    <br />
                    chemistry &lt;- {function in biology &lt;- {purpose among humans}}}}
                    <br />
                    otherwise:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{teleomaty &lt;- {teleonomy &lt;- {teleology}}}.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I cannot see, Stan, how you can say that the heat death of the universe is
                        its
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;purpose or final cause?
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Because that is its tendency as a result of its accelerated
                    <br />
                    expansion having generated a radically noneqiuilibrium world.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am then disturbed by, that we come to humans you just say that there are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;plenty of meanings of the meaning of life and the universe. But they are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjective, cultural and often superstitious constructions and many of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;are contradictory? What kind of argument is that?
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: It is because there are/have been many cultures, and each has
                    <br />
                    constructed its own version of the meaning of existence. These are
                    <br />
                    multiple meanings upon whih diferet poples cannot agree. We need some
                    <br />
                    basic meaning that may be unerstandable to all.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I fail to see a consistent
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;view point in what you say. It confuses me, as we in many ways have the
                        same
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;basic philosophies.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I hope the above diagrams will help.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the line of Peirce's work I see both science, philosophy and religion -
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;even politics - working on the understanding of reality and life - trying
                        to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;get them to make sense. It sure does not now - and the various symbolic
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;generalized medias (as Luhmann calls them) does not interact and corporate
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;very much. We have instead a growth in fundamentalistic views in both
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;religion, politics and science, which I agree threatens to bring the world
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to horrible wars again.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Alas, my point was that EVERY culture has had wars and more wars,
                    <br />
                    and none have been able to explain it to our satisfaction. (For example,
                    <br />
                    Ghengiz Kahn expressed satidfaction that Samarkand was converted into
                    <br />
                    grazing land for horses. So he went to war to promote horse farming!) So
                    <br />
                    I venture the simple explanation that we have been fated to be pulled into
                    <br />
                    wars because we cannot resist maximizing our energy usage.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But exactly the problem of if material growth is the answer to the problem
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of survival and happiness has been discussed between the church and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;politicians plus economists and lately be the environmentalists from the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;idea of scarcity of resources and deeper purposes of human life. Also if
                        the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning is just to be as many living humans here as possible or there is a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;deep quality to human life - like enlightenment in some form. What would
                        be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the broadest common good? It is one of the most important discussions
                        going
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;on now.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Unfortunately I think most of these discussions take place in a
                    <br />
                    'cloud-cuckoo land'!
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My problem is if we can ever know from a common philosophy of science point
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of view, which some of you now turn into an internalist philosophy. To me
                        it
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;is just basic epistemology. It may indicate that final goals has to found
                        in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the emotional and spiritual realm, not in the scientific and political.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: It would be a good thing if you could find this! Perhaps the
                    <br />
                    challenge I gave in my consciously provocative statements could stimulate
                    <br />
                    thinking in this direction.
