Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Some brief comments on the current themes:
<br />
<p>Cristophe --thanks for your new points. At the time being I cannot neither 
<br />
disagree nor agree. In my own terms, understanding the 'proteome-genome' 
<br />
(or perhaps better, 'transcriptome') interrelationship through one of your 
<br />
Meaning Generator Systems might be useful to ascend towards the 
<br />
computational description of further levels of complexity (tissues, organs, 
<br />
systems, organisms). But the proof of the pudding is in the tasting: 
<br />
although the whole cellular complexity is intractable, could you envision a 
<br />
realistic MGS model (in molecular terms), for instance, of the prokaryotic 
<br />
cellular signaling system (the well-known 'two component system') applied 
<br />
to cellular locomotion? This system is now a fashion in alife and 
<br />
autonoumous robotics. There is plenty of data and you could more or less 
<br />
easily submit to the 'molecular test' your MGS computational approach... If 
<br />
you consider interesting the suggestion, I would be happy to collaborate.
<br />
<p>As for Jerry points, I find rather vague his approach to biological 
<br />
optimality. Nowadays there are pretty clear biological treatments of the 
<br />
theme. Stuart Kauffman 'rugged landscapes' (see At home in the universe, 
<br />
1995; Investigations, 2000) are perhaps one of the most interesting 
<br />
EVOLUTIONARY views about how genomes have managed to explore the 
<br />
multidimensional optimization problems confronted by their phenotypes. 
<br />
There is not only one maximum or a minimum, but scores of relative max-min 
<br />
'peaks and valleys' that have to be charted by micro-and macro-movements of 
<br />
the genetic parameters. Depending on the ruggedness of the landscape, and 
<br />
the 'movements' of the environment, the ways to explore these peaks and 
<br />
valleys have to change (eg, prokaryots vs. eukaryots; plants vs. 
<br />
vertebrates). It is the modern version of van Valen 'Red Queen' hypothesis. 
<br />
Although I disagree with Kauffman in other extremes, more or less follow 
<br />
him in this overall approach to biological (and technological!) exploration 
<br />
of optimality when the environment presents conflicting demands... Besides, 
<br />
evidences of optimality in biological STRUCTURES, very well studied ones, 
<br />
pile up in the classical literature (eg, D'Arcy Thompson): skeletons, 
<br />
bones, shells, internal organs, brains, neuronal connections, plants, 
<br />
leaves, flowers, widespread Fibonacci series and golden mean ratios in 
<br />
morphologies, etc. In the late 80's, quite many studies of MOLECULAR 
<br />
optimality were done (eg, glycogen molecular design, pentose cycle, Kelvin 
<br />
cycle, metabolic control, etc.), and quite many mutational analysis were 
<br />
performed --with the result that most natural enzymes are just 'optimal' to 
<br />
their molecular function... FUNCTIONALLY or physiologically (pretty more 
<br />
difficult terrain) there also lots of studies and controversies on 
<br />
allometric relationships, grounded on optimal efficiency when metabolism, 
<br />
transportation, maintenance, degradation, etc. are considered 
<br />
together.  The prevalence of the 3/4 power law relations in most animal 
<br />
species is understood as a hallmark of the systemic quest for optimal 
<br />
efficiency.
<br />
<p>As for John, I appreciate the very elegant synthesis presented about the 
<br />
different approaches (mostly non-biological ones) to extremal principles. I 
<br />
am particularly intrigued by the MaxEntPro. The only additional suggestion 
<br />
I would make about that principle is, What would happen if enzymes had 
<br />
efficiently decoupled their 'informational' work from the thermodynamic 
<br />
entropy (&amp; free energy) requirements?
<br />
<p>About the problem of limitation, relevance, interdisciplinarity, 
<br />
overlapping of sciences, etc, (we may consider it under as many labels or 
<br />
'doctrines' as we wish), it is at the very heart of the FIS mission, at 
<br />
least in my view. Bringing some consistency and clarity (Enlightment as 
<br />
Karl put it so elegantly weeks ago) into the mosaic of information 
<br />
conceptualizations, with conflicting 'surrogates' in almost every mayor 
<br />
discipline, was the initial idea behind the Madrid FIS Conference in 1994. 
<br />
See the Intro to the Proceedings in our FIS home pages. Given that we are 
<br />
these days involved in a philosophically oriented session, it may not look 
<br />
a bad idea that we devote some discussion to this problem too.
<br />
<p>best wishes
<br />
<p>Pedro
