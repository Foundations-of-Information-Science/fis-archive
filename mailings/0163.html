<p>
In this posting, I will try to connect some actual sociological questions
<br />
to some fis-topics of more general interest.
<br />
In my opinion, information science shoud be able to contribute to an
<br />
explication model of social information- and power- management in rapidly
<br />
changing post-industrial society out of equilibirum, a model which allows
<br />
to comprehend the evolution of dynamic collectivities.
<br />
As we know, this problem is not only a sociological one: the evolution of
<br />
dynamic order in self-organized systems and networks moved, also in physics
<br />
and biology, towards the center of interest.
<br />
Radical innovations came from the termodynamics of non-equilibrium, the
<br />
model of hypercycle and synergetics in molecular biology/chemistry and not
<br />
at least from sociological system theory itself, where considerable efforts
<br />
to operationalise some of the new developments in sociology are due to
<br />
Luhmann. He proposed to consider the social system as a selforganising
<br />
network of communications. (The notion of an autopoietic system was first
<br />
developed for describing the organization and reproduction of living
<br />
systems in biology: Maturana &amp; Varela).
<br />
(Social) systems are self-organized. Their product is themselves. Their
<br />
information codes instruct and functionalise emerging
<br />
communicaton-structures. Self-organisation is not only an expression of a
<br />
human subject, but of all kinds of dynamic systems a observing and
<br />
measuring entities and instruments.
<br />
Social change by information processes means the emergence and evolution of
<br />
social networks, as a  product of an onging change of our communication
<br />
systems. That  networks recursively organize themselves in terms of
<br />
emerging identites which cannot be stabilised and controled in traditional
<br />
ways; they remain unstable for evolutionary reasons.
<br />
This implies, that selforganizing systems are not controleable and
<br />
steerable in the usual sense by commands, orders, repression, sanctions,
<br />
role-stabilization, pattern-maintainance etc.
<br />
Therefore, information  is the main &quot;cause&quot; or source for the further
<br />
development of social systems.
<br />
The emergence of change based on information processes depends on, for
<br />
example, an increasing number of interacting entities, an increasing
<br />
density in their communication, and relatively stable linguistic
<br />
constraints.
<br />
Of special interest are changes that lead to higher levels of competence of
<br />
organisations, groups, collectivities, or, in general, of Society as a
<br />
social, economic, cultural and psychological unitiy.
<br />
<p><p>In summa, some hypoteses on the role of information (and its variety) in
<br />
system change may be derived:
<br />
-Social systems which intend an optimation of their creative functions by
<br />
integration of information variety, take advantage in their devellopment in
<br />
comparison to those who neglect this aspect. This optimation is a result of
<br />
feedback between an uncounted number of competitive social values and
<br />
lifetypes. A break in the symmetry  of the political system
<br />
(dominant/dominated) ocurrs. New political groups and behaviours emerge and
<br />
are activated.
<br />
- In the next step, emerging representation of new lifestyles and politic
<br />
management are integrated in a new power division: this network of
<br />
competing and cooperating systems leads to a more productive valoration of
<br />
information, aided by computers and communication technologies.
<br />
- Democracy, liberality and non-repressive social space are important for
<br />
the formation of a new variety of thinking and behaviour. This variety is
<br />
more and more represented by non-ideological political leadership, who
<br />
center on transparency and new division of labor in information society.
<br />
-A new kind of social steering emerges. Self-organisation completes
<br />
hierarquic structures by  horizontal ones. This transformation leads to a
<br />
essential weakening of centralized control functions, aided by
<br />
informatisation of information flows and by a new human consciousness able
<br />
to be valorised poductively by an information society in process of
<br />
maturation.
