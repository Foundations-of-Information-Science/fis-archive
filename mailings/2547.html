                <p>
                    Dear fisers,
                    <br />
                <p>I have been grading almost full time the last week, so I did not
                    <br />
                    get a chance to respond to Arne, or comment on the other interesting
                    <br />
                    recent posts on this topic. I will just make a short realist
                    <br />
                    statement, though. It is based on the Realism of C.S. Peirce. He
                    <br />
                    distinguished between imaginary doubt and real doubt. Real doubt is
                    <br />
                    that which gives us evidence that appears to be contrary to our
                    <br />
                    beliefs. Imaginary doubt is based on possbilities that we have no
                    <br />
                    evidence for, but we believe are at least possible. The problem with
                    <br />
                    imaginary doubt is that it is based on abstract reasoning, void of
                    <br />
                    ties to evidence by and large, and it is thus very fallible.
                    <br />
                <p>Here is what I think:
                    <br />
                <p>I just don't think that we can base epistemology on some consensual
                    <br />
                    agreement about there being an external world, or about some world we
                    <br />
                    have socially constructed. I think that we can know the world in
                    <br />
                    terms of its features, and that we know many features of the world. I
                    <br />
                    think that the world is an information structure along the lines of a
                    <br />
                    distributed system in the line of Barwise and Seligman. The logic of
                    <br />
                    such systems is that we cannot infer backwards to the source in
                    <br />
                    general. We need a special sort of channel to do that. However,
                    <br />
                    science and evolution tend to make such channels. Obviously I would
                    <br />
                    have to get into more detail. Of course this all assumes there is
                    <br />
                    something &quot;out there&quot;. My best evidence for that is that there are
                    <br />
                    things I do not create in my mind. Perhaps they come from other parts
                    <br />
                    of my mind, but that is still &quot;out there&quot; relative to my
                    <br />
                    consciousness. Basically, I think that the evidence that there is
                    <br />
                    something &quot;out there&quot; is very strong, and the evidence that there is
                    <br />
                    not is negligible. That we can't know the &quot;out there&quot; is based on a
                    <br />
                    huge string of inference about the possibility of error in special
                    <br />
                    cases extended to the possibility for all cases. I reject the last
                    <br />
                    part of the argument. I don't think it is possible that everything we
                    <br />
                    believe about the external world is false. My argument again is
                    <br />
                    fairly simple: whatever the structure of the information that we
                    <br />
                    experience, that which we don't consciously cause comes from &quot;out
                    <br />
                    there&quot;, so we know &quot;out there&quot; has at least that much structure. And
                    <br />
                    from there we bootstrap. Part of what we bootstrap to is a consensual
                    <br />
                    world (though I am constantly surprised that my neighbours see so
                    <br />
                    little of what I see, so I am not sure how much is consensual -- I
                    <br />
                    find myself often faking that the world is more like what people
                    <br />
                    around me seem to think it is like -- this dishonesty bugs me, but it
                    <br />
                    saves fights over things like Zulus are much more like
                    <br />
                    Scots-Canadians than they are different from each other -- if I have
                    <br />
                    a Zulu student who wants to think that Zulus are fundamentally
                    <br />
                    different, then I usually let it go.)
                    <br />
                <p>I see no need of any consensual proof of such an abstract entity as a
                    <br />
                    consensually agreed on world in order to have knowledge of an
                    <br />
                    external world, nor do I see that the proof would be very convincing
                    <br />
                    compared to direct experience of things I do not cause myself, and
                    <br />
                    which can surprise me. I think that the evidence for a consensual
                    <br />
                    world must be weaker than the evidence for a world beyond our
                    <br />
                    conscious experience, and any argument in favour of doubting that
                    <br />
                    world must have even weaker evidence. Lacking such evidence, I doubt
                    <br />
                    when I am surprised, and have a reason to doubt. Otherwise, I think
                    <br />
                    both sceptical arguments and anti-realist arguments are all very
                    <br />
                    fallible abstract thinking, which I don't much trust.
                    <br />
                <p>That said, I think that the evidence is that we construct our
                    <br />
                    understanding of the world out of materials from both our mind and
                    <br />
                    the world, so I fall into the category that is usually called
                    <br />
                    constructive realist.
                    <br />
