Dear Michel,
<br />
<p>The relation between thermodynamic entropy and the information is
<br />
provided by the Szilard-Brillouin relation as follows:
<br />
<p>Delta S &gt;= k(B) Delta H
<br />
<p>(W. Ebeling. Chaos, Ordnung und Information. Frankfurt a.M.: Harri
<br />
Deutsch Thun, 1991, at p. 60.)
<br />
<p>k(B) in this formula is the Boltzmann constant. Thus, a physical change
<br />
of the system can provide an information, but it does not have to.
<br />
Unlike the thermodynamic entropy, probabilistic entropy has no
<br />
dimensionality (because it is mathematically defined). The Boltmann
<br />
constant takes care of the correction in the dimensionality in the
<br />
equation.
<br />
<p>When applied as a statistics to other systems (e.g., biological ones)
<br />
one obtains another (specific) theory of communication in which one can
<br />
perhaps find another relation between the (in this case biological)
<br />
information and the probabilistic entropy. This can be elaborated for
<br />
each specific domain.
<br />
<p>With kind regards,
<br />
<p><p>Loet

<p><p>2004 FIS session introductory text.
<br />
<p>Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>I would like to thank Pedro Marijuan for his kind invitation
<br />
to chair the 2004 FIS session. The session is focussed on &quot;Entropy and
<br />
Information&quot;. It is vast, that I am afraid to be able only to evoke some
<br />
general aspects, discarding specific technical developments.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entropy and Information: two polymorphic concepts.
<br />
<p>Although these two concepts are undoubtly related, they have different
<br />
stories.
<br />
<p>Let us consider first the Information concept.
<br />
There was many discussions in the FIS list about the meaning
<br />
of Information. Clearly, there are several definitions.
<br />
The information concept that most people have in mind is outside the
<br />
scope of this text: is it born with Computer Sciences, or is it born
<br />
with Press, or does it exist since a so long time that nobody could date
<br />
it? Neglecting the definitions from the dictionnaries (for each language
<br />
and culture), I would say that anybody has his own concept. Philosophers
<br />
and historians have to look. The content of the FIS archives suggests
<br />
that the field is vast.
<br />
<p>Now let us look to scientific definitions. Those arising from
<br />
mathematics are rigorous, but have different meanings. An example is the
<br />
information concept emerging from information theory (Hartley, Wiener,
<br />
Shannon, Renyi,...). This concept, which arises from probability theory,
<br />
has little connections with the Fisher information, which arises also
<br />
from probability theory. The same word is used, but two rigorous
<br />
concepts are defined. One is mostly related to coding theory, and the
<br />
other is related to estimation theory. One deals mainly with non
<br />
numerical finite discrete distributions, and the other is based on
<br />
statistics from samples of parametrized family of distributions. Even
<br />
within the framework of information theory, there are several
<br />
definitions of information (e.g. see the last chapter of Renyi's book on
<br />
Probability Theory). This situation arises often in mathematics: e.g.,
<br />
there are several concepts of &quot;distance&quot;, and, despite the basic axioms
<br />
they all satisfy, nobody would say that they have the same meaning, even
<br />
when they are defined on a common space.
<br />
<p>Then, mathematical tools are potential (and sometimes demonstrated)
<br />
simplified models for physical phenomenons. On the other hand,
<br />
scientists may publish various definitions of information for physical
<br />
situations. It does not mean that any of these definitions should be
<br />
confused between themselves and confused with the mathematical ones. In
<br />
many papers, the authors insist on the analogies between their own
<br />
concepts and those previously published by other authors: this attitude
<br />
may convince the reviewers of the manuscript that the work has interest,
<br />
but contribute to the general confusion, particularly when the confusing
<br />
terms are recorded in the bibliographic databases. Searching in
<br />
databases with the keyword &quot;information&quot; would lead to a considerable
<br />
number of hits: nobody would try it without constraining the search with
<br />
other terms (did some of you tried?).
<br />
<p>We consider now the Entropy concepts. The two main ones are the
<br />
informational entropy and the thermodynamical entropy. The first one has
<br />
non ambiguous relations with information (in the sense of information
<br />
theory), since both are defined within the framework of a common theory.
<br />
Let us look now to the thermodynamical entropy, which was defined by
<br />
Rudolf Clausius in 1865. It is a physical concept, usually introduced
<br />
from the Carnot Cycle. The existence of entropy is postulated, and it is
<br />
a state function of the system. Usual variables are temperature and
<br />
pressure. Entropy calculations are sometimes made discarding the
<br />
implicit assumptions done for an idealized Carnot Cycle. Here come
<br />
difficulties. E.g., the whole universe is sometimes considered as a
<br />
system for which the the entropy is assumed to have sense. Does the
<br />
equilibrium of such a system has sense? Does thermodynamical state
<br />
functions make sense here? And what about &quot;the&quot; temperature? These
<br />
latter variable, even when viewed as a function of coordinates and/or
<br />
time, has sense only for a restricted number of situations. These
<br />
difficulties appear for many other systems. At other scales, they may
<br />
appear for microscopic systems, and for macroscopic systems unrelated to
<br />
thermochemistry.
<br />
In fact, what is often implicitly postulated is that the thermodynamical
<br />
entropy theory could work outside thermodynamics.
<br />
<p>Statistical mechanics creates a bridge between microscopic and
<br />
macroscopic models, as evidenced from the work of Boltzmann. These two
<br />
models are different. One is a mathematical model for an idealized
<br />
physical situation (punctual balls, elastic collisions, distribution of
<br />
states, etc..), and the other is a simplified physical model, working
<br />
upon a restricted number of conditions. The expression of the entropy,
<br />
calculated via statistical mechanics methods, is formally similar to the
<br />
informational entropy. This latter has appeared many decades after the
<br />
former. Thus, the pioneers of information theory (Shannon, von Neumann)
<br />
who retain the term &quot;entropy&quot;, are undoubtly responsible of the
<br />
historical link between &lt;&lt;Entropy&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;Information&gt;&gt; (e.g. see
<br />
<a href="../../www.bartleby.com/64/C004/024.html">http://www.bartleby.com/64/C004/024.html</a>).
<br />
<p>Although &quot;entropy&quot; is a well known term in information theory, and used
<br />
coherently with the term &quot;information&quot; in this area, the situation is
<br />
different in science. I do not know what is &quot;information&quot; in
<br />
theermodynamics (does anybody know?). However, &quot;chemical information&quot; is
<br />
a well known area of chemistry, which covers many topics, including data
<br />
mining in chemical data bases. In fact, chemical information was
<br />
reognized as a major field when the ACS decided in 1975 to rename one of
<br />
its journals &quot;Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences&quot;: it
<br />
was previously named the &quot;Journal of Chemical Documentation&quot;. There are
<br />
little papers in this journal which are connected with entropy
<br />
(thermodunamical of informational). An example is the 1996 paper of
<br />
Shu-Kun Lin, relating entropy with similarity and symmetry. Similarity
<br />
is itself a major area in chemical information, but I consider that the
<br />
main area of chemical information is related to chemical databases, such
<br />
that the chemical information is represented by the nodes and edges
<br />
graph associated to a structural formula. Actually, mathematical tools
<br />
able to work on this kind of chemical information are lacking,
<br />
particulary for statistics (did anyone performed statistics on graphs?).
<br />
<p>In 1999, the links between information sciences and entropy were again
<br />
recognized, when Shu-Kun lin created the open access journal &quot;Entropy&quot;:
<br />
&lt;&lt;An International and Interdisciplinary Journal of Entropy and
<br />
Information Studies&gt;&gt;. Although most pluridisciplinary journals are at
<br />
the intersection of two areas, Shu-Kun Lin is a pionneer in the field of
<br />
transdisciplinarity, permitting the publication in a single journal of
<br />
works related to entropy and/or information theory, originating from
<br />
mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, economy, and philosophy.
<br />
<p>The concept of information exists in other sciences for which the term
<br />
entropy is used. Bioinformation is a major concept in bioinformatics,
<br />
for which I am not specialist. Thus I hope that Pedro Marijuan would
<br />
like to help us to understand what are the links between bioinformation
<br />
and entropy. Entropy and information are known from economists and
<br />
philosophers. I also hope they add their voice to those of scientists
<br />
and mathematicians, to enlight our discussions during the session.
<br />
<p>Now I would like to draw some provocative conclusions. Analogies between
<br />
concepts or between formal expressions of quantities are useful for the
<br />
spirit, for the quality of the papers, and sometimes they are used by
<br />
modellers to demonstrate why their work merit funds (does anybody never
<br />
do that?). The number of new concepts in sciences (includes mathematics,
<br />
economy, humanities, and so on) is increasing, and new terms are picked
<br />
in our natural language: the task of the teachers becomes harder and
<br />
harder. Entropy and Information are like the &quot;fourth dimension&quot;, one
<br />
century ago: they offer in common the ability to provide exciting topics
<br />
to discuss. Unfortunately, Entropy and Information are much more
<br />
difficult to handle.
