                    10th FIS Discussion Session:
                    <br />
                <p>ON INFORMATION ETHICS
                    <br />
                <p>Answer from the Viewpoint of Rational Machines
                    <br />
                <p>The questions to open the discussion were:
                    <br />
                <p>Q1. What is the philosophic and ethical challenge of the physical, chemical,
                    <br />
                    biological... sciences today with regard to human freedom and the 'laws' (?)
                    <br />
                    that should regulate our actions? What is the meaning of 'natural law' today
                    <br />
                    and can we take it as an analogy (?) in the field of morality? are there
                    <br />
                    other alternatives?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Q2. What is the philosophic and ethical challenge of modern information
                    <br />
                    technology with regard to human freedom? How far do we conceive the
                    <br />
                    'cyberspace' or, more generally speaking, the potential digitization of all
                    <br />
                    phenomena (human and non human) as a (the?) condition for understanding
                    <br />
                    them, and what does this mean with regard to human behavior? More
                    <br />
                    specifically: do we conceive ourselves eventually as information processing
                    <br />
                    devices?, and if yes, what follows with regard to artificial digital devices
                    <br />
                    that we are creating now and in the future?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Q3. What does it mean for human beings to be able to behave in a global
                    <br />
                    digital world in which time and space seem to disappear? What are the
                    <br />
                    consequences of our doing for the whole planet? How can we create rules of
                    <br />
                    action that are accepted by all human beings in order to achieve a global
                    <br />
                    sustainable (physical and cultural and economic...) development without
                    <br />
                    deleting all differences that makes human life worth living?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>In case we would be able to construct an Artificial Person, we would have to
                    <br />
                    address these points, too. So, as we are - conceptually - able to simulate
                    <br />
                    life as a mathematical process, we are confronted with the consequences of
                    <br />
                    the extent of ethical attitudes within the consciousness of this living
                    <br />
                    organism. An ethical rule is in an autoregulated system a rule of behaviour.
                    <br />
                    (It does this because it {usually, normally, always, .} believes this to be
                    <br />
                    the right thing to do.) We deduct an ethical system from the actions of an
                    <br />
                    agent. Therefore, if we lay down rules of behaviour for an artificial
                    <br />
                    intelligence, we lay down its ethics. Asimov has looked quite deeply into
                    <br />
                    this philosophical question (in his theory of robots, as expressed in many
                    <br />
                    of his works.)
                    <br />
                <p>If the living organism is an abstract cell, we could think its ethic to be
                    <br />
                    directed towards survival, growth and reproduction. &quot;Recreate and multiply&quot;
                    <br />
                    is a quite strong, basic, ethical rule. In a more complex environment,
                    <br />
                    optimality of reproductive success can be achieved by further rules, which
                    <br />
                    can be subservient or concurrent (in different hierarchical relations).
                    <br />
                    (e.g. in order to avoid retaliatory extermination, do not kill unless in
                    <br />
                    self-defence)
                    <br />
                <p>This discussion gives us room to design the ethics of an artificial
                    <br />
                    intelligence.
                    <br />
                <p>Q1. What is the philosophic and ethical challenge of the physical, chemical,
                    <br />
                    biological... sciences today with regard to human freedom and the 'laws' (?)
                    <br />
                    that should regulate our actions? What is the meaning of 'natural law' today
                    <br />
                    and can we take it as an analogy (?) in the field of morality? are there
                    <br />
                    other alternatives?
                    <br />
                    A1: In this, or in one of the very next, generations we shall be able to
                    <br />
                    fuse the &quot;rational&quot; concepts with the &quot;emotional&quot; concepts (mechanics and
                    <br />
                    biology). We shall find a gearbox which translates rational relations into
                    <br />
                    congruence with relations discovered on biologic observations. Then, the two
                    <br />
                    sets of connotations will have to compromise. Either, mechanics will also be
                    <br />
                    more divine-transcendent, consciousness-aware, or biology and psychology
                    <br />
                    will be more rational-economic, statistical-optimising, predictable.
                    <br />
                <p>If an agreement is reached that biologic organisms (including humans) act
                    <br />
                    and react along rational rules, this has the consequence that the shamanic
                    <br />
                    class of services suffers a crisis of legitimacy. If any thinking person can
                    <br />
                    deduct the rules of good behaviour, there is no need for specially anointed
                    <br />
                    transmitters of the divine (irrational, non-understandable, transcendent)
                    <br />
                    Will.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>Q2. What is the philosophic and ethical challenge of modern information
                    <br />
                    technology with regard to human freedom? How far do we conceive the
                    <br />
                    'cyberspace' or, more generally speaking, the potential digitization of all
                    <br />
                    phenomena (human and non human) as a (the?) condition for understanding
                    <br />
                    them, and what does this mean with regard to human behavior? More
                    <br />
                    specifically: do we conceive ourselves eventually as information processing
                    <br />
                    devices?, and if yes, what follows with regard to artificial digital devices
                    <br />
                    that we are creating now and in the future?
                    <br />
                    A2: The CNS (central nervous system) is an information processing device.
                    <br />
                    The question is, whether one thinks himself outside his CNS. Current
                    <br />
                    thinking equates &quot;consciousness&quot; with electrical processes (of the
                    <br />
                    alpha-kind, mostly) that take place on the brain while the subject is awake.
                    <br />
                    The veterinary part of the human mind is currently conceptualised as the
                    <br />
                    collection of the biochemical processes that interact with the electrical
                    <br />
                    processes. By and large, one can simplify &quot;emotions&quot; and &quot;thoughts&quot; into
                    <br />
                    biochemical vs. electrical processes. These co-regulate the brain.
                    <br />
                <p>Freedom is, statistically, unpredictability. The extent of predictability is
                    <br />
                    given by Nature (as long as we believe the natural numbers to be a gift of
                    <br />
                    Nature) through some numeric interweave-patterns that explain the
                    <br />
                    co-regulation of a quasi-fluid matter emitting electrical bursts.
                    <br />
                <p>The case of a human making a decision based on his free will is a special
                    <br />
                    case of the predictability of the properties of the next state out of the
                    <br />
                    properties of the present state. How fixed is the future, generally? The
                    <br />
                    answer to this lies in the structure of our basic concepts. (If one grows up
                    <br />
                    in a very strict environment, his opinion of the world will be that it is a
                    <br />
                    non-chaotic system.) We learn our basic concepts - on the rational level -
                    <br />
                    as we go to elementary school. If the (system of rational concepts about
                    <br />
                    the) world has been presented to us as a place where nothing happens by
                    <br />
                    itself, we shall have a static idea about the world. (see: Newton and the
                    <br />
                    non-existence of a perpetuum mobile, e.g. We ourselves experience ourselves
                    <br />
                    as non-static and own-triggered and a perpetuum mobile - maybe only outside
                    <br />
                    school.)
                    <br />
                <p>Trying to find a compromise between the Newtonian idea of a natural,
                    <br />
                    predictable state (idle, etc.) and biology, which is anything but idle, and
                    <br />
                    in some fashions less, in some fashions more predictable than the non-living
                    <br />
                    nature, one finds that predictability is the interplay between what is now
                    <br />
                    and what will be. Counting now, how many diverse kinds of &quot;now&quot; there are
                    <br />
                    and how many diverse kinds of &quot;will be&quot; there are, one finds that the
                    <br />
                    interdependences are more-dimensional and quite complex. The main challenge
                    <br />
                    for information theory is to create an artificial organism that has moods
                    <br />
                    (urges, needs) that can be satisfied by more than one possible action. The
                    <br />
                    good news is that the problem can be solved.
                    <br />
                <p>Q3. What does it mean for human beings to be able to behave in a global
                    <br />
                    digital world in which time and space seem to disappear? What are the
                    <br />
                    consequences of our doing for the whole planet? How can we create rules of
                    <br />
                    action that are accepted by all human beings in order to achieve a global
                    <br />
                    sustainable (physical and cultural and economic...) development without
                    <br />
                    deleting all differences that makes human life worth living?
                    <br />
                    A3: Human behaviour is deeply irrational, instinct driven and
                    <br />
                    opportunistic-maximising. The irrationality refers to stated aims and stated
                    <br />
                    expectations. It is highly rational with respect to the production of
                    <br />
                    hormones within the person. The instincts that govern human behaviour are,
                    <br />
                    as expected, just as ethology describes (rivalry, territoriality, nurturing,
                    <br />
                    etc.). The matter (hormone) human systems maximise is &quot;congruence&quot; (maybe,
                    <br />
                    neuropharmacologists call it endorphins.) The congruence between &quot;expected&quot;
                    <br />
                    and &quot;experienced&quot; values within the CNS is what drives the human animal. (In
                    <br />
                    German, the terms Sollwert and Istwert render the idea very tellingly.)
                    <br />
                <p>As the lasting maximal congruence between Sollwert and Istwert cannot be
                    <br />
                    achieved (due to some number theoretical voodoos), there can be no winning
                    <br />
                    strategy (specifically no single winning strategy). If there would exist a
                    <br />
                    good (or slightly better) strategy how to live (procreate and multiply), we
                    <br />
                    would see it everywhere, winning. So, it is useless to look for The General
                    <br />
                    Solution. It is puzzling whether this or the next generation can build an
                    <br />
                    elite among those who can communicate (via the internet) and whether this
                    <br />
                    elite will achieve a critical mass to try to impose (sell, educate) its
                    <br />
                    ideas on the whole of the population. One should not overemphasise the
                    <br />
                    internet. Now we have recreated the situation in Athen where the
                    <br />
                    well-educated and open-minded burghers spent time chewing philosophical
                    <br />
                    questions like we do. They were within hearing distance to each other and
                    <br />
                    could interact on the spot. This is the state we have regained. We sit again
                    <br />
                    on the agora and hear each other and can reply immediately.
                    <br />
                <p>Let us hope we are as well-motivated and investigative-minded as they were.
