<p>
Dear Pedro and all,
<br />
<p>about your question concerning the meaning of meaning. There is a key
<br />
contribution in the philosophy of language of 20th century, namely Hilary
<br />
Putnam's (a Harvard philosopher) &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot; (in: Philosophical
<br />
Papers, 1975, 3. vol. include some 57 papers between 1957 and 1981). Putnam
<br />
was confronted in the 60s with logical empiricism which he considered a kind
<br />
of idealism and argued at that time in favor of realism. According to the
<br />
verificationist theory of meaning the meaning of a linguistic utterance
<br />
(i.e. its reference or denotatum) is established in the end by a person.
<br />
But, according to Putnam, this theory just forgets no less than the world
<br />
and the other human beings! In other words, the meaning of words cannot be
<br />
disconnected from the linguistic community as well as from the 'Umwelt'.
<br />
Putnam changed later on this view towards an 'internal realism' that is more
<br />
near to Kant than to Hume, and also more near to Gadamer and hermeneutics
<br />
than to analytic philosophy. In his book &quot;Representation and Reality&quot; (MIT
<br />
1988) he argues that the concepts of object, relation, meaning and reason
<br />
are characterized by their &quot;porosity&quot; which means that these concepts (and
<br />
with them language altogether) cannot be fixed once forever. In order to
<br />
visualize this conceptual relativity he tells the following story. Suppose
<br />
you take someone into a room where there is a chair, a table, a lamp, a
<br />
notebook and a pencil. You ask then:
<br />
&quot;How many objects are there in this room?&quot;
<br />
Your friend probably answers: &quot;five&quot;.
<br />
New question: &quot;And they are?&quot;
<br />
Answer: &quot;A chair, a table, a lamp, a notebook, and a pencil&quot;
<br />
New question: &quot;what about you and me?&quot;
<br />
Your friend laughs and says: &quot;I did not know that for you persons are
<br />
considered objects. Well, then seven&quot;
<br />
New question: &quot;And what about the pages of the notebook?&quot;
<br />
etc.
<br />
<p>But, of course, there are also noses in this room as well as elementary
<br />
particles... that can also be considered as the &quot;meaning&quot; of the word
<br />
&quot;object&quot;... In other words, as we say in German, &quot;wir sind nicht alle
<br />
dicht.&quot; This is a pun meaning: we are not completely close and we are all a
<br />
little bit mad...  How far this 'madness' (or 'porosity', well probably,
<br />
'madness' is more a situation of someone who is almost 'closed') is also in
<br />
'lower levels' of organization?
<br />
Putnam turns the question of the relation between the 'intension' and the
<br />
'extension' of a concept into a question of socially mediated &quot;stereotypes.&quot;
<br />
<p>In a famous paragraph (§ 66) of his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;
<br />
Wittgestein says that when we call something a &quot;play&quot; (in German: &quot;Spiel&quot;)
<br />
(like in the utterances used in composed words in German like:
<br />
&quot;Brettspiele&quot;, &quot;Kartenspiele&quot;, &quot;Ballspiel&quot; etc. i.e board game, card game,
<br />
ball game..) and then we ask: &quot;What is common to them?&quot;, we should not say:
<br />
&quot;there *should* be something common, otherwise they would not be called like
<br />
this&quot;, but &quot;*take a look * (&quot;schau&quot;) if this is the case.&quot; This is, as you
<br />
know, Wittgensteins theory of family resemblances which is at the opposite
<br />
of Plato's theory of ideas which is the basis of most theories of meaning in
<br />
our tradition: the meaning of something is related to a 'meta-physical'
<br />
concept ('idea') that allows us to re-cognize things in their being AS this
<br />
or that.
<br />
<p>The question in fact is, that *meaning* for us is concerned with our
<br />
capacity of grasping things in their being: a cat is a cat, not a sign or a
<br />
symbol or whatever. But, indeed, neither things nor we are isolated and
<br />
'worldless' but embeded in a network of (social) relations which makes
<br />
'porosity' possible.
<br />
What is a tree for a cat? We do not know, but we can conjecture as cats
<br />
cannot speak, well with the exception of Dinah, the Cheshire cat. But even
<br />
in that case Alice was not amused with its habits: &quot;It is a very
<br />
inconvenient habit of kittens (alice had once made the remark) that,
<br />
whatever you say to them they *always* purr. &quot;If they would only purr for
<br />
'yes', and mew for 'no,' or any rule of that sort,&quot; she had said, &quot;so that
<br />
one could keep up a conversation! But how *can* you talk with a person if
<br />
they *always* say the same thing?&quot; (Chapter 12: Which Dreamed It?)
<br />
The answer is: we can't because there is no *meaning* there. For a cat, I
<br />
would say, a tree is not a tree but...? Wittgestein put it like this: if a
<br />
lyon could speak we would not understand it.
<br />
<p>Grasping things in their being in such a 'porosity' way means finally, that
<br />
we do not only things AS what they are, but also 'Being' itself (Aristotle's
<br />
question about 'being AS being' 'to on he on': the whole question of meaning
<br />
concerns this *as*). Heideggerian hermeneutics makes a difference between
<br />
two kinds of *AS* the explicit and the implicit one. This means that we
<br />
primarily are 'practical beings' having to do with things AS what they are
<br />
in an implicit network of meaning (we call this in science for instance a
<br />
presupposition or the paradigm implicit in *normal science*) while the
<br />
thematization (and with all epistemology itself) arises when we want to
<br />
share something or also in case of a 'breakdown.'
<br />
<p>This difference between the 'apophantic' (or explicit) and the 'hermeneutic'
<br />
(or implicit) *AS* was used by Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores in their
<br />
book &quot;Understanding Computers and Cognition&quot; (Ablex 1986) for explaining the
<br />
way we (pragmatically) deal with information technology, and particularly
<br />
with programms, when they 'breakdown.' The ability of a good programmer
<br />
should be to foresee such 'breakdowns' in order to keep technology
<br />
transparent. The best technology is one that 'disappears.' We also say that
<br />
some times in our lives, the best understanding is the one 'without words'
<br />
which does not mean 'without meaning.' In 'lower level' of organization, a
<br />
cat for instance, we might conjecture that the absence of meaning (although
<br />
we do not know exactly what this means and therefore we say it as a
<br />
*negation*) does not mean an absence of a 'world': cats have their 'own'
<br />
('closed' ='meaning-less') world (I think this is the point where we join
<br />
Maturana and Varela again...).
<br />
<p>So, finally, Putnam's (and Plato's and...Pedro's) question: how does meaning
<br />
arise or 'what is the meaning of meaning' is a tricky one, as meaning arises
<br />
in a local context (a cat is a cat) but also due to the fact of a system
<br />
capable of looking beyond determination (our 'porosity'), and this during an
<br />
evolutionary process of socialization and practical 'handling' in the world.
<br />
<p>This argument has not a strong explanatory power but I do not know a better
<br />
one!
<br />
<p>Cheers

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Please tell us how you hierarchy is same or differs from mine, and what

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you think is the most fruitful way of proceeding with this problem. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;have a paper on this forthcoming in Axiomathes that are interested in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;this kind of work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I do not understand your remarks on scalar and specification hierarchies

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and the inconsistency you see in the paper. You have to state this

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;clearer for everyone to follow you remarks, please.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  You said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. A non-manifestlevel with hypercomplex or chaotic interactions. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; concept of vacuum in Quantum field theory is one attempt by science to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; describe this state, albeit without a synechistic frame.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. An energy level with energy-based causal interaction by natural
</em><br />
forces.
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. An informational level with signal and/or code causality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. Semiotic level with sign-game-causality within and between living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 5.A linguistic level with language-game-causality based on meaning
</em><br />
between
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; conscious social systems.So, 1. is a transcendental level, 2. the
</em><br />
physical,
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. the chemical, 4. the organic and psychological and 5 the social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; objective knowledge to relate to Hartmann's hierarchy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;      SS: For the record, this is a specification hierarchy, not a
</em><br />
scalar
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; one (which is used later in the paper without distinguishing it.  [See
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; General Systems Bulletin 31: 13-17 (2002)]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      SS again:  The specification hierarchy is, in general:  {more general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;-- {{{increasingly more particular}}}, or {more vague --&gt; {{{
</em><br />
increasingly
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more definite}}}.  ( the brackets, {}, represent classes, arrows indicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drection of construction). What you have here is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {physical level {material level {biological level {sociocultural
</em><br />
level}}}}.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Descriptions of these levels did exist in different areas of modern

</em><br />
or
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; paradigmatic framework.
