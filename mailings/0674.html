Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>I am introducing a few 'introns' (gulp, should I use 'exons' instead?) 
<br />
within the James-John C exchange. They are also related to some aspects of 
<br />
the Edwina-Jerry's mess.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The main reason I introduced the point about enzymes being &quot;fooled&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;pharmaceutical molecules (and, of course, by many natural ones, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;well), though, was to emphasize a point that is stressed in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;philosophical literature on biological functions.  That is, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;normativity is of the essence.  That is, for something to count as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;function in the proper (biological) sense of the word, there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;something that it is supposed to do, something that it can get either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;right or wrong. In short, the concept of function entails that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;malfunction (as well as success, or correct function, of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<p>The right or wrong normativity for biomolecular function is more or less OK 
<br />
in many cases, but it is far from being a general rule (and not at all THE 
<br />
rule). For instance, what happens evolutionarily with the legion of 
<br />
PARALOGOUS genes --those coming from e.g. duplications-- that are initially 
<br />
'vacant' or idle, so 'unfunctional', and little by little acheive a new 
<br />
specific function? Think on the mammals four batteries of homeogenes 
<br />
against the ancestral background of just a single battery with less than 
<br />
half dozen genes. In the vertebrate lineage there are strong evidences of 
<br />
around 2 duplications of the ENTIRE GENOME; also in plants. IThis means 
<br />
continents of supernumerary agents gradually (and saltatorily) evolving new 
<br />
functionalities our from their initial unfunctioning. Besides, the 
<br />
evolution of DNA regulatory cis-sequences, really crucial in eukaryots, is 
<br />
based on the fact that the transcription factor will recognize the mutated 
<br />
target sequence with slight changes in affinity / specificity. But slightly 
<br />
different kinetics in the transcription of e.g. a selector gene in the 
<br />
developmental process of a crucial tissue will bring amazing final 
<br />
differences (eg, development of brain in homo / anthropoids). And needless 
<br />
to argue about the really obscure ranges of functionality hidden in our 
<br />
apparently noncoding DNA (95 % genome).
<br />
<p>I
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I wanted to make this point about function entailing malfunction because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I believe this is where the roots of &quot;purpose&quot; lie in biology (which you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;were questioning). And insofar as information, properly speaking, must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be recognized as having a semantic component, and insofar as meaning is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;likewise a normative and teleological concept, then I believe that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;roots of information lie in this same knot of problems, as well.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sum, as I see it, all of our aporiae in theoretical biology revolve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;around the ontological status of purpose and value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>I was discussing the above aspect not to run against your discussion of 
<br />
biological purpose (I share your interest in naturalizing that concept, 
<br />
which I also see very closely related with info conceptualization) but to 
<br />
call the attention upon premature generalizations that actually leave on 
<br />
the rack (proper idiom?)  very strategic empirical items. In this case, it 
<br />
is the really frequent 'fuzziness' of biological function. Its inherently 
<br />
many-to-many mapping nature. So, robustness and resilience are emerging 
<br />
properties that quite many, many signaling and metabolic, and 
<br />
gene-expression circuits share. We can make an individual agent 
<br />
'malfunction' (either totally, or, as mentioned, more or less, within a 
<br />
very large variation domain). It does not matter. Quite frequently the 
<br />
FUNCTIONAL CLUSTER which includes the agent will globally compensate (in 
<br />
cancer, eg, a mutated Ras may be perfectly counteracted by a correct p53; 
<br />
and if I am not wrong, p16 would compensate for both Ras and p53 
<br />
simultaneous malfunction).
<br />
<p>The point I want to make is the need for new interpretation schemes, mostly 
<br />
BOTTOM UP inspired, and without excessive preconceptions or urges to proof 
<br />
the validity of our a priori chosen theoretical views. The best example I 
<br />
can think of (tomorrow I will try to continue with it) is the historical 
<br />
invention of ZERO. It is not only a metaphor. Indeed, absences have not 
<br />
been properly taken as ways of controlling biofunctionality (in your 
<br />
constructive-degradative system do not care about idle presences, worry 
<br />
about the important absences). Let me add that the idea of 'functional 
<br />
voids' seems to me a necessary complement to the accompanying mechanistic 
<br />
side of functional clusters control... together with many other 
<br />
formal-non-formal exploratory attempts...
<br />
<p>We are in a prediscovery phase, not in a post discovery one. So, the 
<br />
discussion following largely TOP DOWN doctrines that reproduce endless 
<br />
formal discussions on THE correct way to interpret info phenomena is for me 
<br />
not much relevant (some spicy is always fine)...
<br />
<p>Sorry, I have to leave--the bus is getting out right now!
<br />
<p>Pedro
