                <p>
                    Dear Pedro:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    1. You are changing the subject from &quot;social and cultural complexity&quot; to
                    <br />
                    &quot;the nature of complexity&quot;.
                    <br />
                    Thus, our previous communications seem to be discardable as &quot;irrelevant.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Initially, I do not find Stan, Guy and Loet's responses convincing enough.
                    <br />
                    Properly speaking about the social realm, the impervious dominance of the
                    <br />
                    &quot;formal&quot; organizations or &quot;systems&quot; separated form the intrinsic complexity
                    <br />
                    of individual's life, hasn't it been the capital sin of the past century?
                    <br />
                    Among other miscarriages, let us remind dialectical and historical
                    <br />
                    materialism, that pretended science of social change... a form of social
                    <br />
                    mechanics in its purest acception (social masses, social forces, social
                    <br />
                    revolutions, etc.), creating a new standard for human beings, writing in
                    <br />
                    the pretended &quot;blank slate&quot; of human minds. One of the lessons to learn is
                    <br />
                    that the HUMAN FACTOR (or human nature if one prefers) will
                    <br />
                    &quot;systematically&quot; defeat to any systemic planner --be it economic, urban,
                    <br />
                    technological, political, etc.-- who does not care about it. All those
                    <br />
                    &quot;systems&quot; superimposed upon individuals will plunder if they do not let
                    <br />
                    open avenues for the advancement of the human life-cycle.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                <p>I don't expect anybody to plea for imposing a system on human beings a la
                    <br />
                    marxism or fascism.
                    <br />
                    It is not obvious that the human factor is the correct unit of analysis if
                    <br />
                    one is interested in social and cultural complexity. It is undoubtedly the
                    <br />
                    right unit of analysis if one is interested in human complexity. However,
                    <br />
                    many phenomena which emerge on the basis of human (non-linear) interactions
                    <br />
                    cannot be reduced to the carriers.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    For example, a scientific paradigm (a la Kuhn) can be considered as a
                    <br />
                    development of the pre-paradigmatic discourse into a more codified one. The
                    <br />
                    discourse becomes locked-in and then sets the delineations of the relevant
                    <br />
                    contributions to the discourse. Thus, human beings who were previously
                    <br />
                    important to this social/cultural system, are now no longer. As Planck seems
                    <br />
                    to have said, one has to wait till the old boys have died. This is not to
                    <br />
                    deny that human beings are crucial as carriers of a socio-cultural system,
                    <br />
                    but as the dynamics of the neural network are not determined at the level of
                    <br />
                    the cells, but in terms of the wiring, analogously the dynamics of the
                    <br />
                    networks of communications are not necessarily determined by the dynamics of
                    <br />
                    the human carriers. Analytically, the human carriers are structurally
                    <br />
                    coupled as the relevant environment of the social system.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Of course, it sounds nice to proclaim a humanistic a priori. However, as a
                    <br />
                    system of communications the social can be studied as providing a dynamics
                    <br />
                    different and additional to human intentions. It is a different
                    <br />
                    (sub)dynamic. For example, when one follows neo-evolutionary economics
                    <br />
                    (Schumpeter) in stating that innovations can upset the equilibrium seeking
                    <br />
                    tendencies in markets, we are discussing more abstract dynamics than can be
                    <br />
                    explained in terms of carriers (e.g., individual entrepreneurs). In this
                    <br />
                    sense, Marx was right: one creates society, but what happens is beyond
                    <br />
                    control because it is part of another dynamics. (His answers of the
                    <br />
                    possibility of a final reconciliation of these different dynamics was
                    <br />
                    perhaps a bit naive.)
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    I hope that this is helpful. Most likely, it is not &quot;convincing enough&quot;.

                <p>&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    I remember that early computers contained a sort of &quot;refresh&quot; or &quot;reset&quot;
                    <br />
                    tension affecting every transistor so that their functional state, after
                    <br />
                    any work cycle, was effectively set as planned by the designer --probably
                    <br />
                    contemporary microchips are above that limitation... what I mean is that
                    <br />
                    there is no effective, generalized way to isolate the emergent or complex
                    <br />
                    behavior in any realm from all the vagaries of upper and lower realms
                    <br />
                    --except laboratories themselves and techno installations. Nature does not
                    <br />
                    care about crossing our well established disciplinary borders: out-there,
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>The extrinsic versus the intrinsic--this motto transpires quite often (now,
                    <br />
                    for instance) our discussions: the exo vs. the endo, the external vs. the
                    <br />
                    internal, the mechanical vs. the organicist, reductionism vs. holism
                    <br />
                    ... rather than confronting both sides, they should be coupled. My
                    <br />
                    emphasis on the cellular model to adumbrate a cogent integrative
                    <br />
                    informational perspective (connecting with some of Ted's points), is that
                    <br />
                    we can appreciate therein how that integration intrinsic/extrinsic happens
                    <br />
                    in terms of molecular agents inside, and of the signaling clouds from the
                    <br />
                    rest of the organism outside. Apparently, far easier (though not done by
