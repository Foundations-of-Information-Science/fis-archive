Dear Colleagues:
<br />
I have posted my view on the general issue of defining 
<br />
information before, but I did not write about my own 
<br />
understanding of information. I have made a reference to a 
<br />
paper accessible on-line in which I write about it: 
<br />
(&quot;Philosophical Foundations for the Concept of Information: 
<br />
Selective and Structural Information&quot; Proceedings of 
<br />
FIS2005 (<a href="../../www.mdpi.org/fis2005/F.58.paper.pdf">http://www.mdpi.org/fis2005/F.58.paper.pdf</a>). 
<br />
In current discussion some definitions that I quoted in my 
<br />
earlier posting have become associated with me, while they 
<br />
are very far from my own views. Thus, I feel compelled to 
<br />
summarize my own views on the subject.
<br />
Before that, let me review the main points of my earlier 
<br />
posting.
<br />
1. Definition of the concept (the classical 
<br />
genus/differentia definition) is locating this concept 
<br />
within the reference frame of the structure of some other 
<br />
concepts. The structure of concepts is based on the 
<br />
inclusion of their extensions (generality). 
<br />
The most general concepts (of the highest generality) have 
<br />
to be accepted as primitive concepts 
<br />
(e.g. &quot;set&quot; and &quot;belonging to set&quot; in a set theory) and 
<br />
their characterization is given through axioms. Other 
<br />
concepts are, or can be derived from the primitive concepts 
<br />
through the process of defining. 
<br />
<p>2. It is possible to disqualify a definition as incorrect,  
<br />
e.g. circular, when refering in the definiens (that what 
<br />
defines) to the definiendum (that what is defined). However, 
<br />
without clearly distinguished extension of the definition 
<br />
(the class of objects to which the definition refers) the 
<br />
normative statements, such as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; do not have 
<br />
any meaning. Only after we establish the intent of the 
<br />
definition (what objects the definition refers to) we can 
<br />
say: &quot;This definition is not good, because I can give you an 
<br />
example of the object which should be described by the 
<br />
definition, but it isn't.&quot; (the case of too narrow, or not 
<br />
enough general definition) or &quot;This definition is not good, 
<br />
because I can give you an example of an object which should 
<br />
not be described by the definition, but it is.&quot; (the case of 
<br />
too wide, or too general definition)
<br />
<p>3. I am very concerned by some statements in the present 
<br />
discussion that suggest that there is only one possible 
<br />
definition of information. It is perfectly legitimate to 
<br />
say: &quot;In my opinion the concept of information should not 
<br />
include xyz.&quot; But to say &quot;Xyz is not information&quot; and to 
<br />
consider it a definite, absolute truth is in my opinion 
<br />
dangerous. After all, we discuss a definition of information 
<br />
in order to present our own ways to understand this concept. 
<br />
There is nothing wrong with some variety of definitions. 
<br />
With time some &quot;orthodox&quot; definition may be established, but 
<br />
even then someone may continue to use a different approach. 
<br />
To use this type of uniformizing approach before the 
<br />
discussion has brought all or majority of views to attention 
<br />
is something that bothers me. At this stage I would suggest 
<br />
to eliminate (possibly for further improvement) only 
<br />
definitions which are logically incorrect or which are very 
<br />
clearly too narrow. 
<br />
<p>4. Writing a definition is much more than writing one or a 
<br />
few sentences. It is true that when the conceptual framework 
<br />
has been established, the task is limited to short 
<br />
formulation of the definition with a reference to a couple 
<br />
of concepts. I do not believe that we are at the stage with 
<br />
clearly established conceptual frame. There are several 
<br />
categories of definitions of information (in this discussion 
<br />
and in the literature of the subject) based on different 
<br />
conceptual frameworks. For instance:
<br />
a) Definitions based on common sense terminology 
<br />
(e.g. &quot;Reduction of uncertainty&quot;, &quot;A difference which makes 
<br />
a difference&quot;, etc.) 
<br />
b) Definitions based on the concept of datum (or data)
<br />
assuming the existence of some structure of concepts 
<br />
characterizing or defining the concept of datum.
<br />
c) Definitions based on the concept of representation (e.g. 
<br />
MacKay), in which the concept of representation is build 
<br />
upon some other concepts.
<br />
d) Definitions based on the concept of communication in 
<br />
which communication is put in the framework of concepts such 
<br />
as message, source, chanel, etc.
<br />
e) Definitions based on the concept of form based on one of 
<br />
possible philosophical systems involving a distinction of 
<br />
form and other components of the entities.
<br />
In each case the definition, even when it involves only few 
<br />
words, actually takes into consideration all complex of 
<br />
concepts. 
<br />
<p>In my opinion, it would be quite naive to expect that any 
<br />
definition of a concept of a high level of generality, as I 
<br />
understand information, can be formulated in terms of one or 
<br />
two common sense concepts. I believe that any selection of 
<br />
the definition must involve a selection of all philosophical 
<br />
system in which the concept is placed. This philosophical 
<br />
system will answer the questions about information defined 
<br />
within it. What kind of answers about information we can 
<br />
expect in the future study, if we do not provide by our 
<br />
definition any philosophical tools to understand the 
<br />
relationship of information to the matter, living organizms, 
<br />
knowledge, consciousness, social and cultural issues, etc.? 
<br />
<p>5. In my attempts to find a definition of information which 
<br />
includes a wide range of entities that I believe can be 
<br />
viewed as instances of information, I have found that the 
<br />
only common concepts involved in the description of all 
<br />
instances of what I believe is information are variety and 
<br />
unity. Since it seemed to me that information should be 
<br />
related to actual or potential transition from variety to 
<br />
unity, and the relationship of one and many is one of only 
<br />
few most fundamental topics of philosophy, I have used this 
<br />
relationship as foundation. 
<br />
<p>6. Thus my DEFINITION OF INFORMATION is as follows:
<br />
<p>INFORMATION IS AN IDENTIFICATION OF A VARIETY, where  
<br />
identification is understood in terms of the one-many 
<br />
relation as a characteristic or complex of characteristics 
<br />
of the element of a variety (the ‚Äúmany‚Äù) which select, 
<br />
distinguish one out of many, or alternatively, as an 
<br />
internal structure of the many which gives the variety its 
<br />
unity. 
<br />
<p>7. This alternative produces apparent opposition of the two 
<br />
forms of information, selective and structural. The 
<br />
opposition is only apparent, as the two types are 
<br />
inseparable. The elements of the variety can have distinct 
<br />
internal or individual characteristics only if they have 
<br />
their own internal structures. The structure of the variety 
<br />
carrying ‚Äústructural information‚Äù can always be considered 
<br />
one of a variety of potential structures out of which it is 
<br />
selected. Thus, the selective and structural forms of 
<br />
information are rather dual manifestations of the uniform 
<br />
concept of information derived from the dual relationship of 
<br />
one and many. The selective aspect of information is more 
<br />
salient when the identification of the one out of many is 
<br />
predominant through its own individual characteristics, 
<br />
while the structural aspect is salient when the 
<br />
identification is rather through the participation of the 
<br />
element in the structure of the variety. Both aspects can be 
<br />
present at the same time, as for example in the way of 
<br />
selecting ‚Äúthe first red ball on the left‚Äù. When we refer 
<br />
to the color of the ball, we refer to the selective aspect, 
<br />
when we refer to the location in the variety of balls ‚Äúthe 
<br />
first on the left,‚Äù we use the structural aspect of 
<br />
information. 
<br />
<p>8.Thus, we can consider information only when there is some 
<br />
predefined variety (the ‚Äúmany‚Äù) and when with this many 
<br />
there is associated some unity (the ‚Äúone‚Äù). The association 
<br />
of the one with the many is information. Sometimes there is 
<br />
no such association, and the quantitative characteristic of 
<br />
the information is zero. For instance if the variety 
<br />
consists of the six possible outcomes of casting 
<br />
an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù die, and the one is the actual outcome of the 
<br />
cast, there is no association of the one and the many. The 
<br />
measure of information in this case is zero. If the die 
<br />
is ‚Äúloaded‚Äù so that in every cast only the outcome six 
<br />
appears, the association is strongest and the quantitative 
<br />
characteristic of information is maximal. With an 
<br />
appropriate choice of the measure we can for instance assign 
<br />
the value to this case log 6. The die can be partially 
<br />
loaded, and the value of the measure would vary between the 
<br />
two extremes. This simple example is signalizing the 
<br />
difference between the usual quantitative characteristic of 
<br />
information in terms of entropy which corresponds to the 
<br />
concept of information derived from ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù 
<br />
or ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù, and more compatible with the one-many based 
<br />
approach to information, alternative measure (see my paper 
<br />
on this topic, Entropy 2004, 6, 388-412 at 
<br />
<a href="../../www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e6050388.pdf/default.htm">http://www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e6050388.pdf/</a>)   
<br />
However, as long as we are searching for the conceptual 
<br />
framework for information the discussion of its quantitative 
<br />
aspects is not necessary. 
<br />
<p>9. The definition of information as identification of a 
<br />
variety is definitely very general, but I believe it does 
<br />
not include anything which could raise objection &quot;this 
<br />
definitely is not information&quot;. 
<br />
When I presented this definition in December in Tokyo at 
<br />
Information 2004 Conference, some of listeners had 
<br />
objections that &quot;Basicaly it says the same as 
<br />
the 'uncertainty definition' but in a different way when we 
<br />
think about uncertainty as multiplicity causing 
<br />
uncerttainty&quot;. Others have found correspondences with other 
<br />
definitions, &quot;if we understand...&quot; Thus, it looks like the 
<br />
definition of information as identification of a variety 
<br />
meets intuitive understanding of information not only mine. 
<br />
<p>10. The use of the term &quot;identification&quot; may cause some 
<br />
objections: Can't you find better word? &quot;Identification&quot; has 
<br />
already had generic meaning which is compatible (although is 
<br />
not identical)with the meaning in the definition when we 
<br />
talk about selective information, but is quite far from the 
<br />
meaning of structural information. To identify has strong 
<br />
association with selection, but not with structure. 
<br />
I could not find better term. For instance &quot;unification of 
<br />
the variety&quot; would shift the meaning towards structural 
<br />
information, but also could cause confusion with 
<br />
uniformization of variety. Thus, &quot;identification&quot; seems, if 
<br />
not &quot;good&quot;, then &quot;good enough&quot;. 
<br />
