Subject:  Re: [Fis] bioinformation and entropy
<br />
Sent:  5/13/04 1:12 AM
<br />
<p>Dear Pedro et al,
<br />
<p>If I may be so bold as to join the discussion at so late a date,  I would
<br />
like to take up the issue of quantum entropies and biocomputing. I have I
<br />
been feasting on this very stimulating discussion for some weeks now. Pedro
<br />
had suggested I weave in some of the late Michael Conrad's work on entropies
<br />
in biological systems.
<br />
<p><p>The remarks of Michael Devereux on the Shannon H make a nice lead-in here.
<br />
One of the recurring features of Michael Conrad's work was his use of
<br />
Shannon entropy and related functions. He originally used it to discuss
<br />
statistical and hierarchical aspects of ecosystem organization, but then
<br />
went on to connect to deeper theories about the limits and tradeoffs of
<br />
information processing in nature. As his student in the 1980s, I was
<br />
fascinated the by latter in particular, and had many conversations with him
<br />
about it, but never quite understood his fixation on H in this context.
<br />
Then, about 2000, ironically about a month after his death, I noticed how a
<br />
connection with quantum (von Neumann) entropy seemed to give it greater
<br />
interest. I wrote a little piece on it in Biosystems (2002), and, if you
<br />
will let me give a rough short summary of it here, I think it will connect
<br />
smoothly to some of the ongoing discussions.
<br />
<p><p>In this part of his work, Michael would speak of biological systems as very
<br />
large but finite Markov systems, flickering probabilistically through many
<br />
states. He partitioned the system into &quot;biota&quot; and &quot;environment&quot;, say B and
<br />
E.  He would speak of the entropy of the biota as H(B), being the familiar -
<br />
Sum p(b) log p(b), summing over all biological states b.  Similarly, one
<br />
defines H(E) and the joint entropy H(BE). Conditional entropies are defined
<br />
as H(E|B) = H(EB)-H(B), etc.
<br />
<p><p>A crucial move was to define the &quot;adaptability&quot; of a biological system as
<br />
the maximal value of H(E) such that B (life) was sustainable. He called this
<br />
H(E!), E! coming to mean the &quot;most stressed&quot; environment and B! the most
<br />
stressed biota. His next step, the heart of this theory, was to interpret a
<br />
very simple formula in a very creative way. The formula is easily derivable
<br />
from the definitions:
<br />
<p><p>H(E!) = H(B!) + H(E!|B!) - H(B!|E!).
<br />
<p>Just as philosophers interested in uncertainty will ponder the true meaning
<br />
of Bayes theorem (which to mathematicians is a trivial consequence of the
<br />
definition of probability), Michael meditated at length on the
<br />
interpretation of this formula in the context of living systems and
<br />
information. He identified the terms as follows:
<br />
<p><p>H(E!) : adaptability
<br />
=
<br />
H(B!) : biotic behavioral/dynamic diversity
<br />
+
<br />
H(E!|B!): environmental fluctuations
<br />
-
<br />
H(B!|E!) : autonomy of biota
<br />
<p>He noted that since the last term was subtracted, greater autonomy led to
<br />
lower adaptability. (He applied this lesson in areas as grand as global
<br />
sociology!) The autonomy term he also associated with information processing
<br />
power. This led (supplemented by other, independent arguments) to his
<br />
Tradeoff Principle: that systems, natural or artificial, could not
<br />
simultaneously have high levels of programmability, adaptability, and
<br />
efficiency.  One consequence was that he was very pessimistic about
<br />
capturing the essence of life in digital simulations.
<br />
<p><p>What I noticed in 2000 was that if you reworked this using von Neumann
<br />
entropy rather than Shannon entropy, there was a nicely strange
<br />
interpretation available. First, you would have to view this as a truly
<br />
quantum system. We might be talking about some kind of neuronal cytoskeletal
<br />
system in a Hameroff-Penrose world where quantum entanglement is a source of
<br />
information processing power. (Koichiro has also written about entangled
<br />
quantum coherence in living systems, more convincingly I believe.) So the
<br />
joint system EB would be a tensor product, and the probabilities would be
<br />
given by a density matrix rho.  The von Neumann entropy is just S = - Sum p
<br />
log p, where now we are summing over the eigenvalues p of rho.  Conditional
<br />
entropies are defined the same way as in the Shannon case. But now,
<br />
interestingly, they may be negative. That is, for example, we can have in
<br />
certain situations H(B|E)&lt;0.  This, oddly, means the joint system BE may be
<br />
less uncertain than E alone. This will happen in entangled systems. Since
<br />
H(B!|E!) makes a negative contribution to adaptability, a negative-valued
<br />
H(B!|E!) suggests that quantum mechanics enables greater adaptability,
<br />
growing out of non-classical supercorrelations between living systems and
<br />
their environment.
<br />
<p>Well, that's the rough overview. I realize that placing a heavy burden of
<br />
creative interpretation on simple formulas is not always intellectually
<br />
healthy. Still, I found this habit of Michael's to be very stimulating.
<br />
<p>A while ago Pedro mentioned that:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; My personal opinion is that MOLECULAR RECOGNITION becomes the best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; systematic thread to follow in the labyrinthic paths of the cell
</em><br />
<p>and suggests that this transcends mere &quot;bioinformatics.&quot; Yes-- molecular
<br />
recognition is where we leave the straightforward world of syntax (strings
<br />
of nucleotides or amino acids) and get into the tactile, dynamic, folding,
<br />
entangled, virtually uncomputable semantics of life.  I would very much like
<br />
to come to understand what makes this molecular substrate of life so
<br />
amenable to evolution (whereas straight syntactic structures are not). It
<br />
seems that quantum entropy-related information measures must be key. I look
<br />
forward to being a somewhat more active participant here.
<br />
<p>Kindest regards,
<br />
-- Kevin
<br />
<p><p><p>P.S.  Shu-Kun Lin asked a few weeks ago about &quot;entropy&quot; in ancient Greek.
<br />
According to Liddell and Scott, the standard scholarly Greek-English
<br />
lexicon, entrope' means &quot;a turning towards&quot;, but also a &quot;dodge&quot;, and, in
<br />
Homer &quot;entropia&quot; is a &quot;trick&quot;!  Of course, it was re-coined by Clausius who
<br />
patterned it after &quot;en-ergy&quot; (en-tropos literally as inherent
<br />
transformability) rather than after its original Greek meaning. But, with
<br />
demons and all, I think we can say the &quot;trickiness&quot; has not disappeared!
