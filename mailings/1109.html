<br />
Hi FISers!
<br />
<p><p><p>First an idea. Do you know Linux, basically a Finnish invention? Do you know
<br />
Nokia, basically a Finnish invention? What we offer here is basically a
<br />
Finnish (yes) invention (?). And to process it like the Linux. Vision is,
<br />
that Nokia- type phenomenon will form. We believe on networked, free system.
<br />
Lets make information science in a new way!
<br />
<p>Then an offer. What you get? We offer joy and fun. See below. Ref. Linux and
<br />
Spinoza.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>And now some first comments to our &quot;theory&quot;, and by &quot;our&quot; I mean you (the
<br />
reader, FISers) and us, the starters.
<br />
<p>A. To understand the point of the theory, one has to step outside the human
<br />
information concept (brains) and to look what are the differences, if there
<br />
is any, in relationship to other information concepts (cell, book, computer,
<br />
laws of nature...). Is there something that unites these different concepts?
<br />
And to really understand ourselves, we have to understand where we come
<br />
from. We have to understand evolution, also in respect to the information,
<br />
if we really want to understand information. This is also a holistic view to
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>B. It is important to notice that computer (generally lower level
<br />
information systems, or lower level systems as a general) does not have
<br />
consciousness, it just is processing the differences that have &quot;meaning&quot;,
<br />
significance, for it according to simple physical etc. laws. So computer is
<br />
not brains, computer is more like a speedier and linear neuron. Computer
<br />
does not interpret information. It does some signal processing. Parts of a
<br />
computer system does not have a &quot;understanding&quot; meaning for the computer,
<br />
but a meaning in that sense, that without a part that have a &quot;meaning&quot; for
<br />
the computer, it is not a computer (or a system) anymore or it does not
<br />
function as a computer (or a system) anymore. This apply to every lower
<br />
level system and its part. This &quot;meaning&quot; of the parts of a system is just
<br />
the definition of a system: A system consists of parts, that have a
<br />
&quot;meaning&quot;, without which the system is not a system anymore.
<br />
So human information notion like &quot;meaning&quot;, &quot;interpretation&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;,
<br />
&quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot; have a equal, less demanding counterpart in
<br />
lower information system. The basic system is the same: New emergent level
<br />
of information mean new notions for information.
<br />
<p>C. Our theory explains the following &quot;standard&quot; information notions or other
<br />
important aspects of the existence:
<br />
- 1. Information hierarchy (e.g. data, information, knowledge,
<br />
understanding, wisdom) and what is the process from lower level to the
<br />
higher level
<br />
- 2. what consciousness is and how it is formed and what will follow
<br />
- 3. the importance of difference in existence
<br />
- 4. how existence is expanded to new forms of system
<br />
- 5. the importance of the part and recursion in the existence and how
<br />
relationships of part and the whole is mandatory
<br />
- 6. how there is no new material in the existence, just new order? Or
<br />
relationship of material, energy, information, systems?
<br />
- 7. how new information is a product of material context and of the
<br />
information context
<br />
- 8. that information has a threshold effect that is dependent of the
<br />
structure of the system
<br />
- 9. that the relevance of information is system and time dependant
<br />
- 10. how information separates from matter and builds up abstract
<br />
information levels
<br />
- 11. why it is not possible to duplicate human higher information
<br />
(knowledge, understanding and wisdom)
<br />
- 12. why information can be multiplied but not the material
<br />
- 13. that there is potential information and information that acts
<br />
- 14. why information can replace other resourcies
<br />
- 15. that information is (a) a message, (b) a media (Ref. McLuhan) and (c)
<br />
the glue that binds the system together
<br />
- 16. that philosophical truth is always relative
<br />
- 17. where Plato was right (mostly) and were he was wrong concerning some
<br />
information ideas
<br />
- 18. why human understanding is always individual
<br />
- 19. how the basic cybernetic system of information and act is formed
<br />
- 20. how to research complex information systems
<br />
<p>See also our original message for some consequencies from our &quot;theory&quot;.
<br />
These above 20 results are discussed more below.
<br />
<p>1.Information hierarchy: One idea of the ENSI- theory is that there are in
<br />
evolution different kinds complex information systems and lots of more
<br />
simpler ones. Every information system starts at the bottom:
<br />
a) What is the basic unit of information of the system? The basic difference
<br />
in the difference that has a meaning for the system. (A bit, a ATCG-
<br />
(adenine, thymine..) selection in a DNA, a letter, a neuron...). The system
<br />
can (of course) identify its basic information unit and it has an effect
<br />
(&quot;meaning&quot;) on the system. This basic unit is called data. Data is a
<br />
selection from valid code possibilities. Data as a basic information unit is
<br />
seldom real information for its system.
<br />
b) A collection of data, that has a extra &quot;meaning&quot; for the system is called
<br />
information (A byte or word, four sequential ATCG (adenine...) parts, a
<br />
word, a pack of neurons (?)...).  There happens an emergent transition from
<br />
data to next information level, and the lower level information has an extra
<br />
significance at the next higher level according to the structure of the system.
<br />
So in English information is a general notion of information and collection
<br />
of data? Or is there better definitions? In Finnish we can bypass this problem.
<br />
c) When the system is &quot;processing&quot; (information is having its effect in the
<br />
system) its information, it gets extra &quot;meaning&quot; for the system (A word (32
<br />
bits) = machine instruction code, a 4 sequential ATCG- parts = amino acid
<br />
code, a three letter word (cat) = a special kind of pet animal, a pack of
<br />
neurons = ?). There happens an emergent transition from information to next
<br />
level information, where the information has its effect. So the importance
<br />
of the act. In a man we call it knowledge.
<br />
d) Hereafter the process is recursive: The higher level &quot;interprets&quot; a bunch
<br />
of lower information and gets it an extra &quot;meaning&quot;, so the sum is bigger
<br />
than the part, because of the &quot;interpretation&quot; of the structure. There
<br />
happens an emergent transition from lower level information to the next
<br />
higher level. A new and bigger information unit is formed at every level and
<br />
is can be addressed as a one unit. At every level more material base in also
<br />
needed for the bigger information units or for higher levels. Ref. New level
<br />
is a bunch of lower level information units.
<br />
An example: Computer:
<br />
a) Fist information level: data, the basic information unit is a bit, zero
<br />
or one. One choice that halves the uncertainty.
<br />
b) Second information level, byte or word (e.g. 32 bits), information, a
<br />
collection of data, that as a new unit has an extra &quot;meaning&quot; for the
<br />
computer besides its parts, the 32 bits.
<br />
c) Third information level, e.g. machine instruction code, significance of
<br />
information (a 32 bit word) to the computer, &quot;knowledge&quot;: The first
<br />
&quot;interpretation&quot; by the structure of the computer, the microprocessor. This
<br />
&quot;interpretation&quot; puts extra significance (&quot;meaning&quot;) for the information. 32
<br />
bits (information) are transformed to a machine language code, for instance:
<br />
load register A with a memory place that is pointed by register B, so e.g.
<br />
0101.....101 (32 bits) = Load(A,B), a new unit, one machine instruction
<br />
code, a new unit of selection.
<br />
c) Fourth information level, subroutine, &quot;understanding&quot;: The meaning of a
<br />
bunch of information. A collection of &quot;knowledge&quot; that has an extra
<br />
&quot;meaning&quot; for the computer. For example a subroutine that multiplies two
<br />
floating point numbers. Now there is a new unit that has extra &quot;meaning&quot; for
<br />
the computer as a higher system than the machine instruction code. It can be
<br />
suppressed to a more abstract information: (SubRMultip(A, B)), actually e.g.
<br />
3200 bits and 100 machine instruction codes.
<br />
d) Fifth information level, a whole program, &quot;wisdom&quot;:   The &quot;meaning&quot; of a
<br />
bunch of &quot;understanding&quot;, that has extra &quot;meaning&quot;, significance for the
<br />
computer. For instance a spreadsheet program. It can be suppressed to a more
<br />
abstract format (e.g. Lotus123), actually 10.000.000 bits, 100.000 machine
<br />
instruction codes, 1000 subroutines and one program framework.
<br />
e) whole computer (hardware and different levels of software) ... (Apple)
<br />
f) network of computers ... (the computer network of your company)
<br />
g) network of networks of computer... (internet)
<br />
<p>2. What consciousness is and how it is formed and what will follow?
<br />
Consciousness is the product of evolutionary process to bigger information
<br />
units. Consciousness is an emergent new feature at high level of information
<br />
hierarchy. Consciousness is difficult to understand because it is very
<br />
probable, that there are many levels of subfeatures that are emergent
<br />
between the consciousness level and the neuron level. Consciousness is also
<br />
difficult to understand because it is based on the most complex and most
<br />
networked structure we know, the human brain. There will be (or is already)
<br />
higher level information systems than the human consciousness. And they are?
<br />
Bigger, and/or maybe based on different structural principles. Ref. neuron
<br />
signals 0,1 km/s, light 300.000 km/s.
<br />
<p>3.  The importance of difference in existence:
<br />
Is there anything to measure, to perceive if there is no difference? Ref.
<br />
induction (from parts to whole) and deduction (from whole to parts). If
<br />
there is no differences, there is nothing, to which there is no differences.
<br />
<p>4. How existence is expanded to new forms of systems
<br />
There is three kinds of information in regard to existence:
<br />
a) Information to be interpreted = past, what have existed before. Past is
<br />
also the cause - effect relationships from present towards the beginning of
<br />
the universe. So this is the information structure of the universe, energy
<br />
that keeps the universe in order. And also, the theories and the information
<br />
of the universe have always been there and are always there as the cause -
<br />
effect relationship, as the information of the universe.
<br />
b) Information interpreting = present systems (material and its structural
<br />
information), parts for new systems to exist latter
<br />
c) interpreted = future, what will exist after the act. So the importance of
<br />
the act.
<br />
Ref. to Popper's three worlds: (1) Physical world = past, to be interpreted,
<br />
(2) mental = present, interpreting and (3) ideas = future, interpreted
<br />
information and after the act, existing new things. Ref. also Plato's world
<br />
of matter and world of ideas.  Plato misses the mental information and the
<br />
importance of the act? Ref. semantics.
<br />
An example:
<br />
a)  Information to be interpreted: (an imagine of) a cake
<br />
b) Information interpreting = present systems (material and its structural
<br />
information), parts for new systems to exist: A human being, a knife and an
<br />
intent
<br />
c) interpreted = future, what will exist after the act. So the importance of
<br />
the act: The cake is halved by the human being with the knife and now there
<br />
is two parts of a cake. Intent (information) and act = new systems, or in
<br />
this case, a new difference.
<br />
<p>5. The importance of the part and recursion in the existence and how
<br />
relationships of part and the whole is mandatory:
<br />
Existence: The whole: No difference, no information. Void?
<br />
A part of the existence: Now there is two relationship (?): From the part to
<br />
the existence and from the existence to the part. But if these two
<br />
relationships do not exist? So the part has no relationship to the
<br />
existence, the part does not exist to the existence. So there is no part for
<br />
the existence, which is impossible, contrary to the premise. So, if there is
<br />
a part it has to have a relationship to the existence, otherwise it does not
<br />
exist as a part of the existence, so to the existence.
<br />
Is the existence a whole that has recursively divided to its basic elements
<br />
and is now processing towards bigger systems, towards the initial whole?
<br />
With Big Bang this means that to divide releases energy? And to unite means
<br />
to consume energy?
<br />
To multiply information means to build a new structure, to unite things.
<br />
This means that to multiply information means to consume energy, to use
<br />
euros, pounds etc.
<br />
<p>6. How there is no new material in the existence, just new order? Or
<br />
relationship of material, energy, information, systems?
<br />
If there is a new system in existence, it is caused by something already
<br />
existing. So a new system is just a new order of the previous part of the
<br />
existence. So, there is nothing new (material) in the existence, just new
<br />
order of older (smaller) systems. Or if energy is released, smaller systems
<br />
than previously. So what we have here? Relationships of material, energy,
<br />
information, systems?
<br />
<p>So a modification to our theory:
<br />
New Assumption 7: To form a new bigger system one needs energy. To break a
<br />
systems to its parts releases energy.
<br />
Old Assumption 7 = New assumption 8.
<br />
This is fun, try it! Ref. Linux as a process. And fun = joy and Spinoza.
<br />
What! Ok, to move from parts to whole is a joy (something like that).
<br />
Wait! Old parts we have already. So we need energy and what we get? A new,
<br />
bigger system. And the relationships of its parts, information, interpreting
<br />
structure. So energy = information. It forces something to happen. Systems
<br />
to function. Yes. It have to be energy! What was Big Bang? Huge release of
<br />
energy, it is a huge release of information. But! There is two kind of
<br />
energies. The potential energy, energy that is capable to cause something
<br />
and energy that causes something after the act. So again, the importance of
<br />
the act. Ref. Spinoza.
<br />
Yes. This is fun! Try it!
<br />
<p>7. How new information is a product of the material context and of the
<br />
information context:
<br />
Interpreted information is a product of two parts:
<br />
a) interpreting information, which is an internal cause, it is the structure
<br />
of the system (hardware) and, if the system is capable to learn, its learned
<br />
models (software)
<br />
b) information to be interpreted, which is an external cause, the
<br />
environment, the existence, the material context, which is interpreted as
<br />
information.
<br />
So interpreted information is a product of the material and information
<br />
context, both internally and externally,
<br />
If there is no external information (cause) for a system it is because the
<br />
system is the existence, the whole.
<br />
<p>8. That information has a threshold effect that is dependent of the
<br />
structure of the system:
<br />
To process information to a higher level requires a bunch of lower level
<br />
information. One information can not be information on a new higher level,
<br />
because it already on its own level. At what level a bunch of lower level
<br />
information is a new information unit on a new higher level, depends on the
<br />
information system, because the structure of the system is interpreting its
<br />
information. Ref. data fusion. Computer. Cell/DNA...
<br />
This means also, that information has a system dependant threshold - effect.
<br />
There is no effect on a bunch of lower level information before there is
<br />
enough lower level information to cause a unit of higher level information.
<br />
Ref. wisdom, understanding, knowledge.
<br />
<p>9.  That the relevance of information is system and time dependant:
<br />
System dependance has been dealt with earlier (interpreting or
<br />
&quot;interpreting&quot; structure). If a system is capable to store interpreting
<br />
information (models etc.) and use this stored information, the state of the
<br />
system is time dependant. At different times an input information has
<br />
different interpretation because of different interpreting information. Ref.
<br />
a modification of a gene expressed in the next generation. The same applies
<br />
to the input information. Different input information on the same
<br />
interpreting information has different information as an output. Ref. a
<br />
change in the evolution and required change in the DNA. Or change in the
<br />
size or functioning of the social, technological, military etc. systems of a
<br />
man and required change in the social, technological, military etc behaviour
<br />
of the individual and its bigger systems. To notice the change (a
<br />
difference) in the outer systems and to act on this information to your
<br />
advantage, is to survive.
<br />
<p>10. How information separates from matter and builds up abstract information
<br />
levels:
<br />
Only consciousness (an emergent feature on high level of information
<br />
hierarchy) gives the system an ability to think, to assign meanings, to
<br />
interpret. On a lower level the process is similar, but without &quot;freedom&quot;,
<br />
it is automatic or acts according to laws of physics etc. The software
<br />
level, the phenomenon, where the information is separated from the matter,
<br />
puts extra flexibility to the information system, because there no need to
<br />
build an other structure of rearrange the old to support new needs. But;
<br />
this level is based on matter. Ref. brains and the abstract thinking of a
<br />
man. And still, the extra level of abstract information processing requires
<br />
larger unit than the lower level in same kind of information system. So even
<br />
the enlarged abstract information processing requires large material base.
<br />
<p>11. Why it is not possible to duplicate human higher information (knowledge,
<br />
understanding and wisdom)?
<br />
It has been sed that one can not duplicate the interpreting information
<br />
(knowledge), just physical information, data and information. This is not
<br />
quite true according to our theory. Interpreting information can be
<br />
duplicated by duplicating the interpreting structure. This is not possible
<br />
regarding the brains of a man. But it is possible regarding the computer.
<br />
This is a descriptive example of the holistic point of view of our theory.
<br />
Human information is just one information system in the evolution, although
<br />
important to us. But to concentrate on human interpretation of information
<br />
will not lead to wider understanding of the information in general. But
<br />
wider understanding of the information in the evolution will lead to new
<br />
understanding of the human information.
<br />
<p>12. Why information can be multiplied but not the material?
<br />
Information can be multiplied and it is still a difference. Information is a
<br />
difference and if the structure (a electronic state of a couple of
<br />
transistors, a chapter in a book) of the information can be multiplied, the
<br />
information can be multiplied. It is still a difference, even in regard to
<br />
the original information, if it has a difference to original information.
<br />
The difference can be place (ref. bits in a computer memory) or time (same
<br />
philosophical ideas separated by thousand years) etc.
<br />
<p>13. That there is potential information and information that acts:
<br />
Information has an effect only through the act. This has been demonstrated
<br />
earlier. So there is (a) potential of information to act and (b) used
<br />
information that has been acted upon.
<br />
One central question (of the information society or of the information war)
<br />
is to distribute the right information potential to the actor for a base to act.
<br />
<p>14. Why information can replace other resourcies:
<br />
Information is a difference that has a meaning for its system. Meaning = has
<br />
some effect on the system. So by finding from the information potential a
<br />
special kind of information (that has effect x), we can replace with this
<br />
information other kinds of resources that would have the same effect (x).
<br />
So information can replace other effecting resources. How much, is system
<br />
dependent.
<br />
<p>15. Information is (a) message, (b) a media and (c) glue that binds the
<br />
system together.
<br />
(a) In out theory input information, information to be interpreted is the
<br />
message.
<br />
(b) In our theory the interpreting information, the structure of the system
<br />
is the media. (Ref. McLuhan)
<br />
(c) In our theory the relationship between the parts of a system is
<br />
information and the glue (energy!, see, 6.) that binds the system together.
<br />
<p>16. That philosophical truth is always relative:
<br />
Information as a (human) philosophical truth according to our theory is
<br />
always a relative one. It is always based on its interpreting structure, so
<br />
different information structures, systems, have different truths.
<br />
Information also as a philosophical truth is a product of the input
<br />
information. This means that information as a philosophical truth has a time
<br />
dependance (in learning systems). This is evident in the evolution of the
<br />
science and of the philosophy.
<br />
The intuition is still behind our theory. We cannot find a interpretation
<br />
for the intuition. Still, we (Sakari and Risto) believe in it. What do quant
<br />
researchers say?
<br />
<p>17. Where Plato was right (mostly) and were he was wrong concerning some
<br />
information ideas:
<br />
&nbsp;Plato (some examples) and our information theory:
<br />
The myth of the cave (life as shadows in the wall): A man (an information
<br />
system) can not know the world as it is through his senses. His
<br />
understanding is always a limited interpretation. This is according to our
<br />
theory. But:  Plato's real world (ideas through reason) is a cure but not
<br />
the final cure as Plato sees According to our theory human thinking is based
<br />
on a limited, although extremely complex and extremely networked structure
<br />
(brains) and is so limited by its structure.  There will be in evolution (or
<br />
is there already?) higher information levels than the human thinking as we
<br />
know it now. So according to our theory sense based information is bad
<br />
(Plato right), human reason based information is better (Plato right), but
<br />
higher information levels are still better (an enlarged information view,
<br />
that Plato did not have). According to our theory, there is lower level
<br />
information processing than the human (abstract) thinking and there is, or
<br />
will be higher level information processing than the human (abstract) thinking.
<br />
World of reason: Ideas, mathematics. Plato considers this as a the real
<br />
world. According to our theory, if ideas exist, they have a cause, they do
<br />
not exist alone. (According to our theory, nothing can exist alone.) Here we
<br />
have a conflict with Plato. Our first try to explane this: Plato misses the
<br />
mental world (?), which for instance Karl Popper has. Ideas and mathematics
<br />
exist, but only because the mental world (thinking). And mental world exist
<br />
only because of the physical world (brains). 
<br />
World of sense: Physical world. Plato considers this as a imperfect and
<br />
changing. According to our theory this is information to be interpreted by
<br />
the stricture of the system. It is in accordance with our theory. The
<br />
interpreted information, world of sense, is always limited. First limited by
<br />
the input (senses) and secondly limited by the interpreting structure.
<br />
Plato and the &quot;atheia&quot;, that all knowledge is already there. This is also
<br />
according to our theory. All that is, is based on what have been in the
<br />
past. So every structure, it is all information, is because of the cause and
<br />
effect relationship. Through this cause and effect relationship all that
<br />
exists now, have been as a potential earlier and have materialized latter.
<br />
Also, everything that will be possible will materialize after its
<br />
precondition are formed. So material take time to form, but information as a
<br />
cause and effect (the structure of the universe) have been there since the
<br />
Big Bang.
<br />
For the human being it is important to notice, that for him/her this
<br />
&quot;all-information&quot; is just a potential, that he/she as a limited structure
<br />
cannot (ever) understand.
<br />
<p>18. Why human understanding is always individual:
<br />
New information is produced by input information and by the structure of the
<br />
system. So, different structures have different effect on the same input
<br />
information. Ref. we are all individuals, entities with different history,
<br />
values etc. So, we are different structures, when interpreting our inputs.
<br />
Ref. also hierarchy, fully connected net and mesh. Further, if the structure
<br />
has special qualities, this will effect on its information processes. Ref.
<br />
nets have feedback loops, a structure that can cause nonlinear or
<br />
exponential effects. Ref brains and computer.
<br />
<p>19. How the basic cybernetic system of information and act is formed:
<br />
Cybernetic systems: &quot;They are dynamical systems that possess input, state
<br />
and output, and consequently an evolution equation. Such a system is
<br />
cybernetic if it is possible to distinguish an observational sequence (of
<br />
the inputs), followed by a decisional sequence leading to the effectors
<br />
organs (related to outputs), being well understood that the observational
<br />
sequence allows the system to observe its environment and itself.&quot;
<br />
(<a href="../../www.imprint.co.uk/thesaurus/cybernetic%20system.htm">http://www.imprint.co.uk/thesaurus/cybernetic%20system.htm</a>)
<br />
So according to our theory:
<br />
1. Dynamic systems: Ok. (recursive relationships between a part (system) and
<br />
its environment)
<br />
2. Input, state, output: Ok. (state = structure, system)
<br />
3. Evolution equation: Ok. (Evolutionary ... theory)
<br />
4. observational sequence (of the inputs): Ok. (difference that has a meaning)
<br />
5. followed by a decisional sequence: Ok. (interpreted information, the
<br />
effect of the meaning)
<br />
6. leading to the effectors organs (related to outputs): Ok. (the importance
<br />
of the act, to effect)
<br />
7. being well understood that the observational sequence allows the system
<br />
to observe its environment and itself: Ok. (recursive relationships between
<br />
a part (system) and its environment; interpreting information)
<br />
<p>20. How to research complex information systems?
<br />
According to our theory the key words are complexity, networks and
<br />
emergence. They are interrelated. All are difficult and new notions.
<br />
Emergence is especially difficult. In multilevel information systems like
<br />
the brains, one has to find the path through sequential emergent features,
<br />
level by level. The basic research question is: What is the entity that
<br />
forms a new emergent feature and what this emergent feature is? This is a
<br />
recursive question at every new level.
