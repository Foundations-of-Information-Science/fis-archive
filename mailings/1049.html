Hi Karl,
<br />
<p>You suggested:
<br />
<p>&lt;Let us discuss the concepts of &lt;&quot;element&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;
<br />
&lt;and such in more depth and detail.
<br />
<p>It is interesting to notice the emergence of nonlinear semantics
<br />
mirroring the interest in non-Euclidian mathematics 
<br />
(yourself Michael Leyton, Mark Burgin)
<br />
adumbrated in this forum. Like acts of counting, the elements of 
<br />
language have sound, visual array and 'minimal logical extent'.
<br />
<p>The recently available Visual Thesaurus from the 
<br />
Princeton Cognition Labs might help us explore 
<br />
concepts on a semantic level beyond 'Sachverhalte',
<br />
Carnapian intension or etymological hermeneutics. 
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.visualthesaurus.com/desktop/index.jsp">http://www.visualthesaurus.com/desktop/index.jsp</a>
<br />
<p>When playing with the VT meaning
<br />
seems to generate spontaneously
<br />
from the immanent configurations rather
<br />
than prescriptively.
<br />
<p>To visualise words as floating groups
<br />
(try 'symmetry' and see what appears
<br />
in the 'background of associative diversity' 
<br />
or our friend 'information' and its
<br />
little cousin 'info') may even bring
<br />
us closer to the relationship between
<br />
language and molecular or (for all we know)
<br />
musical grouping and aesthetic dynamics.
<br />
<p>Any tools that might free us from
<br />
linear thought processes should 
<br />
be welcome. 
<br />
<p>The Health Language Technologies Group
<br />
in Colorado produced a similar visual map of
<br />
MEDLINE terms which throws into relief
<br />
working concepts masked by traditional
<br />
hierarchical thesauri.
<br />
<p>It would be interesting to develop
<br />
a working visual theaurus for the
<br />
word 'information'including
<br />
all those tangential concepts
<br />
that have been floating around 
<br />
our FIS discussions.
<br />
<p>Cheers,
<br />

Group Theory, Quantum Mechanics, and Music
<br />
<p><p>Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>Let us discuss the concepts of &quot;element&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;quality&quot; and
<br />
such in more depth and detail.
<br />
The word &quot;element&quot; can be understood both in a set-theoretical and in a
<br />
chemico-logical sense. The concept goes back to the Greek a-tomos (not
<br />
divisible). It is basically a tactile experience. If you can touch it and it
<br />
is of minimal extent, we call it &quot;object&quot;, &quot;element&quot;, &quot;idealised thing&quot; and
<br />
such. If you cannot touch it and it is of a minimal extent, we call it
<br />
&quot;force&quot;, &quot;space&quot;, &quot;relation&quot;, &quot;logical principle&quot; and the like.
<br />
As we play with cards, we distinguish the cards as physical things we can
<br />
bite on and sensually experience and the ways of playing (with) them which
<br />
we cannot sense by older regions of the brain. Experiences we make before
<br />
having learnt to speak we treat differently to experiences we store in such
<br />
parts of the brain the lexicon is in connection with.
<br />
So, we have avoided mixing (linking) the two levels up: the set of objects
<br />
and the set of their relations. Yet, it is a great difference if we speak of
<br />
a set, whether we mean the number of &quot;Sachverhalte&quot; (Wittgenstein: ~ logical
<br />
facts) or the number of tactile things.
<br />
My approach integrates the Kant concept of the thing as such and the
<br />
Wittgenstein concept of the (number of) ways of being included in
<br />
Sachverhalte (logical relations). My starting point is to investigate:
<br />
&quot;How many logical relations are there per object AND which fraction of thing
<br />
is needed to represent a logical relation with?&quot;. These symmetric questions
<br />
touch the information carrying ability of carriers, therefore have some
<br />
relevance. The answers are: a) it depends (of the number of objects) and b)
<br />
it depends (of their diversity).
<br />
Kant has solved the question in a marginally optimizing way: he treats the
<br />
objects as all absolutely alike, so there can be no logical relations
<br />
between them above their number. (Apples or eggs nonmarked, all absolutely
<br />
alike, you can only divide into subsets and say 3+3+5 is different to 1+2+8,
<br />
without taking into account, what kind are there in each subset and which of
<br />
the elements is individual.) Humanistic psychology and some approaches
<br />
towards theoretical genetics (including the presently preferred technical
<br />
way of treating info, based on the Shannon algorithm) optimise also in a
<br />
marginalising way, by saying that the diversity has no quantitative aspects:
<br />
each individual is individual and you cannot use weighing and averaging. If
<br />
you treat each byte individually, you have to know its place.
<br />
Therefore, the integrative approach counts as well the diversity and the
<br />
similarity of objects. Going deep down into the philosophy of mathematics
<br />
(and counting) we see that what we compare whichever extent with is a basic
<br />
etalon of background being made up of elementar units, all alike. We believe
<br />
that 5 or 10 are made up of 5 times the 1 and 10 times the 1, respectively,
<br />
and that each of the 1-s is absolutely like the next. We see the diversity
<br />
(which is in this case the extent: 5 or 10) before a background of
<br />
similarity (namely of the series of 1-s, all alike).
<br />
Now to the similarity: I have invented a measure for the diversity of
<br />
extents and I may warmly propose its use. It is a nice, cute, slick little
<br />
invention. It disregards the absolute extent and denotes the diversity of
<br />
the parts the thing is made up of. One can count the number of non-alike
<br />
logical relations in the set of logical relations the thing is generating.
<br />
This is an approach towards &quot;information content&quot;. By re-enumerating the set
<br />
N, one finds a background of diversity, afore which one may recognise the
<br />
similarities.
<br />
<p>The idea is to use those logical sentences that are formally, grammatically
<br />
true both with respect to their referring to similarities and to
<br />
diversities. Roughly 10% of all additions on N are true on M also. Those
<br />
additions that describe something more .t. than other additions, do have
<br />
some more body, substance, corpus, content, value, density, kick, elementary
<br />
precedence, don't they.
<br />
Then, we make combinations of these sentences. We are still just generating
<br />
logical sentences and watch whether we find some agglomerations of logical
<br />
relations (non-tactile stuff) into fractions of objects (tactile, sensuous
<br />
stuff). We do. These agglomerations of objects will become different to each
<br />
other, with some fascinating details and regularities to observe.
<br />
<p>I have tried to draw a picture of a middle thing between a hard, solid thing
<br />
(you can put into the mouth and be sure that it is there) and a possibility.
<br />
Some 2-3 generations ago one has shown that indeed there is a numeric
<br />
relationship between non-tactile logical concepts and tactile materials.
<br />
Based on this insight, some have stuffed things so much densely together
<br />
that the non-tactile logical relations had no more place and the thing blew
<br />
up. We know that there is a real, physical interdependence between density
<br />
and places for this density. Presently, we are in the midst of the task of
<br />
understanding how this happens. I advance that we look into the expected
<br />
number of logical relations per object of a set.
<br />
Hope you like the concepts.
<br />
Karl
