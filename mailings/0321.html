<br />
<p>Every person planning to attend BAC 2001 &quot;Unity through Diversity&quot; is
<br />
invited to participate in one or several of the Symposia (listed below)
<br />
that have been programmed for recognizing and criticizing constructively
<br />
some of the contributions made by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in order to
<br />
examine through a debate organized by the same participants feasible
<br />
options leading to create reliable circumstances for pushing ahead the
<br />
Bertalanffian ideology at the dawn of the 21st century
<br />
<p>Symposium (I). &quot;The creation of a sustainable society depends on Innovative
<br />
Systems Thinking (IST) supported by General Systems Weltanschauung (GSW)&quot;
<br />
aims at exploring how it might be feasible to reach Sustainable Development
<br />
as a steady state or flow equilibrium of humankind's dynamics.
<br />
<p>Symposium (II) &quot;Wholism (or Holism) The way forward into the 21st century&quot;
<br />
aims at searching further how human beings may and also should learn to
<br />
develop their way of thinking for clearly seeing the forest before they may
<br />
start dealing with one or another tree; and also for grasping the meaning
<br />
of a tree before trying to handle one of the leaves or a flower or a fruit.
<br />
<p>Symposium (III) &quot;General Systems Theory as a Methodological Maxim&quot; aims at
<br />
pondering why and how GST could and should prescribe better foresight
<br />
rather than hindsight; be used for crisis prevention in preference to
<br />
crisis management: may widen the scope of inquiry for asking first whether
<br />
a certain project, policy or action is justified,...
<br />
<p>Symposium (IV) &quot;New Image of Man and Woman&quot; supported by a new General
<br />
Anthropology&quot; aims at searching reliable ways for building the
<br />
interdisciplinary enterprise (comprising human biology, psychology,
<br />
psychiatry, sociology, linguistics, economics, the arts,...) that may help
<br />
to create societal circumstances needed for allowing the individual
<br />
emergence during the life of every person learning on his/her own to
<br />
consciously develop his/her peculiar personality, while his/her intrinsic
<br />
spontaneity was confronted to diverse cultural, economic and social
<br />
conditions determined peculiarly by the performance of those humans that
<br />
constitute every human society,...
<br />
<p>Symposium (V) &quot;Development of Perspectivism, as a Systems Epistemology&quot;
<br />
aims at making more evident the disciplinary and mutidisciplinary  validity
<br />
of the Bertalanffian Perspectivism as a way of getting closer and closer,
<br />
though diversely, to the 'absolute truth' of every aspect of the whole
<br />
reality through the truth of many different perspectives of each one of
<br />
these aspects, gradually as soon as each perspective is expressed.
<br />
<p>Symposium (VI) &quot;Business based on Bertalanffy's Weltanschauung&quot; aims at
<br />
searching how to build the optional circumstances that are needed for the
<br />
emergence of a new ENTREPRENEURSHIP SPIRIT. The spirit required for leading
<br />
business to be oriented by the &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; suggested by Bertalanffy,
<br />
as the  global awareness that may generate the ecological, ethological &amp;
<br />
ethical values needed: 1) for taking care of the proper preservation of
<br />
GAIA's features; 2) for maintaining the BIODIVERSITY that may help humans
<br />
to learn how to increase the survival chances of our species; 3) for making
<br />
feasible to interpret humanely and implement cogently a Terrestrial Bill of
<br />
HUMAN RIGHTS and COMMITMENTS.
<br />
