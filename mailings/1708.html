<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Pedro, and All,
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This brings me to the other issue that Pedro has raised--whether we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view the sciences in terms of a strict hierarchy, in which physics informs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all the special sciences, but is never informed by them,
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This locution is incorrect for the specification hierarchy that I
<br />
believe is being discussed -- e.g., {more generally applicable phenomena
<br />
{more particular phenomena}}.  The levels in this hierarchy are referred to
<br />
as 'integrative levels' because the higher (more inner) levels integrate
<br />
(control, regulate, inform, interpret, harness) the lower (more outer)
<br />
levels.  Thus, biology regulates diffusion by way of contrivances in the
<br />
circulatory system.  This aspect is not, I agree, an import from set
<br />
theory, but a further development of this kind of hierarchy (which may
<br />
indeed -- for all I know -- have a mathematical interpretation in set
<br />
theory itself).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;or whether a circle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of sciences is a better metaphor because it allows that every science can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informed by any other science.  It seems to me that if the circle metaphor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implies that connections between sciences are entirely symmetrical,
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Not in this herarchy.  The lower levels make possible the higher,
<br />
providing material causes, while the higher integrate these, providing
<br />
formal causation.   There could be a symmetrical locution that would be
<br />
correct -- both upper and lower levels provide affordances for each other,
<br />
but these affordances are quite different going one way or the other.  It
<br />
is simply that' affordance' is a very general reference, as in {affordance
<br />
{integration}}, or {affordance {making possible}} being equally possible.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;says, incorrectly in my view, that statistical mechanics and thermodynamics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have an equal status.  I agree that the strict reductionist view that falls
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out of a strict hierarchical view of science is too rigid.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: That would indeed be a reductionist reading.  Note, however, that
<br />
in this format it would be permissable to derive a purely physical
<br />
understanding of a biological system, by deliberately leaving out explicit
<br />
expression of the formal causes involved.  This kind of representation
<br />
could be interesting from an evolutionary point of view
<br />
<p>&nbsp;A better view
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to be a mixture of both. After all, theories, such as statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanics, have achieved a bone fide kind of consilience that has not, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will not, be achieved by any theory at the phenomenological level.  On the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other hand, higher level theories, no matter how consilient, are in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constant state of development, which is driven by the development of less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consilient phenomenological theories below them in the hierarchy.  There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a kind of coevolution between the levels.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: This is incorporable into the specification hierarchy.
<br />
<p>Aleks said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Hierarchies of sciences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps that is demonstration enough that vertical integration is beneficial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if not necessary. And here come in Pedro's diagrams of sciences. I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see a need for politically correct circularity.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: In my view, the circularity is imposed only in the postmodern
<br />
social constructivist perspective, where the hierarchy winds up inside the
<br />
innermost (highest) level -- human sociocultural cognition.  That was the
<br />
way I used the circularity, which, then, is not a strict circularity at all.
<br />
<p>I also agree with the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;optimistic viewpoint that there needs to be only a single vertical field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that provides the cognitive &quot;tools&quot; (which are, however, psychologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;feasible) to all the horizontal fields. Role models already exist: logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematics and statistics (and philosophy that studies their foundations).
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: So, {logic {math {statistics {foundational studies}}}}.  Note here
<br />
that the specification hierarchy formally branches (to the right here), so
<br />
that other fields than statistics can be derived from basic math.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a side note, I found Pedro's reference to circle of knowledge very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting. There, religion and philosophy are in the center. Where is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;religion today?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: In the hierarchy {mind {inorganic realm {organic realm {biological
<br />
realm {human cognition}}}}} the religious implication has usually been
<br />
imputed to 'mind' -- the totipotence from which all else devolves.  The
<br />
contructivist move is to place all of this inside human cognition as one of
<br />
its products.
<br />
<p>While philosophy sets the framework for what and how to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think, religion answers the Why?.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: So does any final cause, including the Second Law of T.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. Objects reified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematics and logic, for one, have been cast in stone. Nobody dares
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question the fundamentals anymore, it would be unimaginable throwing all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that away. This seems like a proof of Stan's senescence.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: It is certainly an attribute of senescence in my concept of it.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic are all discrete, based on objects and their behavior. Probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory, too, is discrete, with the division of the universe into discrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events. And without probability theory, there is no statistical notions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information or entropy. If you now look at the natural world, you don't see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects: you see the fuzz of interlocking leaves, the swaying fur of grass,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the smooth gusting of wind, swarming of flies, the gritty mess of mud, soil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and pebbles on the ground, the swirling stream, the foamy foam.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you turn and look at a urban landscape: objects (discrete buildings),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects (discrete chair), objects (discrete road-side signs), objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(discrete potted plants), objects (discrete buttons), objects (discrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;humans), objects (discrete molecules of air), objects (discrete plant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species), objects (discrete knots of wind speed), objects (centimeters of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;leaf surface area), objects (zeros and ones encoding the music on a CD),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pummeling of photons, cascading of electrons. We don't know what there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inside an atom, but surely it's objects, and objects within them. Computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are engineered so that everything is fully deterministic and predictable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and there is nothing that is not an unnested discrete binary object, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equal, all egalitarian.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: In using the specification hierarchy for evolutionary thinking,
<br />
the format is read as {vague -&gt; {{{{increasingly more highly specified}}}}}.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We're trying to fit every aspect of nature to objects and to relationships
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between them. The problems we have with concepts like continuity (what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinity? what is zero? what is divide-by-zero?), forces, fields,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships and interactions (are two particles interacting at a distance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or are they really a single object? is a molecule of my body an independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;molecule or is it my body?) are a kludge retrofitted on objects that tries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to capture everything that objects alone miss. Indeed, our representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have senesced, and all we will ever do will be in the context of objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*Can* we think in some other way than by reifying objects, or has our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cognition senesced a long time ago? If computers don't, do we still have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;freedom to think in non-objects? Fuzzy logic is not an answer: every fuzzy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variable is still an object: either it's hot or it is not, two values, two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects. Just as in logic, a hypothesis is either perfectly true or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perfectly false.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I am one who hopes fervently for development of a logic of
<br />
vagueness, toward which maybe second order fuzziness points.  My problem is
<br />
I am not capable of working on that problem
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You might wonder for a few seconds, perhaps admit it, but you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certainly not want to work in this direction. Life's too short and that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;senescence.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I hope you will not give up entirely!
<br />
