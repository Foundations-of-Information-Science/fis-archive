<p>
Dear FIS colleagues
<br />
<p>Let me try a few comments on Michel´s recent question, connecting also with 
<br />
recent messages of Kevin and Koichiro.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Finally, I asked again my question about order/disorder/chaos:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is there a definition valid in the &quot;static&quot; case (no time) ?
</em><br />
<p>I cannot help but reminding the ISIS-Symmetry conference in Haifa, 1998, 
<br />
the motto of which was &quot;Order and Disorder&quot;. There were quite many 
<br />
presentations heterogeneously dealing with the order/disorder theme, some 
<br />
of them addressed towards symmetry/information/entropy conceptualizations 
<br />
(e.g., Gyuri's). My impression then, and now, is that the unification of 
<br />
all the different approaches to 'order' under one single conceptual scheme 
<br />
is impossible: tantamount to the extension of Hilbert's formalistic program 
<br />
to the whole scientific enterprise (I think other parties have said similar 
<br />
things in recent weeks, however I disagree in the way they see the 
<br />
relationship among scientific disciplines. Mixing up with another 
<br />
discussion, in general all the disciplines become 'open', 'pluralistic' and 
<br />
'symmetric' in their interrealtionships within the system of the sciences. 
<br />
Some ideas exchanged months ago on 'locality' of knowledge militate in this 
<br />
direction. 'Reductionism' as an exclusive intellectual strategy becomes a 
<br />
cul-de-sac, particularly for us information scientists).
<br />
<p>Different theories or approaches to 'order' are needed, the most elegant, 
<br />
concise and minimalist the best. I like Karl's multidimensional partitions 
<br />
approach (though I cannot see yet how a complex qualitative distribution in 
<br />
three dimensional space may be handled down). I also much like Michael 
<br />
Leyton approach to symmetry breaking as symmetry extension by wreath 
<br />
products --and his two books are monumental catalogs of how group theory 
<br />
may be used to built unending varieties of 'order'), etc. Going in the 
<br />
thermodynamic direction, treating entropy as 'space-time occupancy' makes 
<br />
it amenable to see how space-time neighborhood relationships are altered 
<br />
(this is my personal preference for 'order': and also of some physical 
<br />
chemists). This is fine if the model system is simple enough, 
<br />
and  restricted to molecular systems frankly homogenous --the cosmological 
<br />
connotations of order are quite fascinating, but they would be completely 
<br />
outside my personal scope, biologically oriented.
<br />
<p>The problem of singularity, uniqueness, heterogeneity, etc. (Bob mentioned 
<br />
it weeks ago)  is so enormous in the molecular-biological realm that any 
<br />
mechanical statistical approach identifying entropy-energy changes with 
<br />
information changes becomes meaningless. Protein folding, protein-protein 
<br />
recognition (protein degradation too), and in general protein (enzyme) 
<br />
function are central players of biological organization where 
<br />
energy/entropy/information flows are definitely decoupled. We badly need a 
<br />
new framework where these bioinformation conundrums get properly 
<br />
established. In this sense, I much welcome the general comments made by 
<br />
Kevin on Conrad's adaptability and molecular recognition. Do adaptability 
<br />
tradeoffs also reign within the molecular-intracellular realm? Under this 
<br />
guidance I made some speculations that the fraction of the genome that can 
<br />
be potentially expressed in each tissue, the protein 'complement' or the 
<br />
proteome effectively materialized in each tissue, and the amount of 
<br />
'signaling system' elements (signalome) follow that global tradeoff. In the 
<br />
neuronal case the result is an enormous physiological stress... (by far the 
<br />
most delicate tissue of the organism). I hope this discussion will get 
<br />
progressively developed within our list.
<br />
<p>It also connects with the question I made last week to Koichiro on neuronal 
<br />
involvement in quantum processing (thanks for his quantum entropies 
<br />
comments). I will try to rephrase the question. If an ideal observer, say a 
<br />
Maxwell's demon enters into a 'house of wonders' where everything is kept 
<br />
in a coherent state, what would happen with his space-time observations 
<br />
upon the coherent world there, by means of his clock and ruler for instance 
<br />
(perhaps also in coherent state)? Then, a 'window' is suddenly open 
<br />
(magnetically?) upon the external world that precipitates into decoherence: 
<br />
how the demon would see our classical world? And finally, what if the demon 
<br />
can connect to a Web from the very inside, and Internet of sorts, could he 
<br />
combine in any way the quantum processing he can make inside the House of 
<br />
Wonders with the mundane Internet? By breaking the initial question into 
<br />
three, I hope that at least one of them becomes a little more answerable!
<br />
<p>best greetings
<br />
<p>Pedro
