<br />
<p>Dear Friends and Sentient Beings,
<br />
<p>I want you to know about this action that began in a conversation 
<br />
group in its fourth meeting here in Santa Cruz a couple of weeks ago.
<br />
<p>Would you get it out to your extensive network?  This is just the 
<br />
beginning. Nine months later on Mothers Day we will have another one 
<br />
and another one and on and on and on till REAL changes are made.
<br />
<p>Love and thanks for all your forwards,
<br />
<p>Barbara
<br />
<p><p><p><p>Women Strike 11-11
<br />
<p>A worldwide day to raise consciousness and stand up to proclaim that:
<br />
<p>° We CAN live together in joy and celebration without fear and deprivation.
<br />
<p>°  We CAN stop the insanity of greed and violence which is driving 
<br />
humanity to its own annihilation.
<br />
<p>° Many of us CAN stop the destructive actions of the few.
<br />
<p>This is a call to gather together in celebration of respect for all 
<br />
life and all love.
<br />
<p>Women-Stop offering your service at work and in your communities on 
<br />
11-11-02, and beyond as needed. Like-hearted men please support the 
<br />
women in your life to participate.
<br />
<p><p><p>Why Women?
<br />
<p>Women contribute fully 2/3 of the work in the world with next to no 
<br />
voice among the leadership of the world. By this call, we can stop 
<br />
the world and the destructive path of the world leaders. The values 
<br />
of nurturing, kindness, caring, dignity, integrity, -and loving one 
<br />
another have been turned upside down and ignored far too long.
<br />
<p>The themes of terrorism and retaliation are rooted in the loss of 
<br />
human dignity and disregard for human life. They are promoted by 
<br />
focusing on our differences without recognizing our 
<br />
interconnectedness. We all know the horrors plaguing our world. 
<br />
Thousands of children die daily of starvation. Too many people are 
<br />
homeless. Yet, the knowledge, technology and resources are available 
<br />
to feed, clothes and house every person on earth without harm. The 
<br />
global economy is collapsing as untold billions of dollars are 
<br />
diverted to wars and to the pockets of a few executives. Women do not 
<br />
give birth to watch our babies die in war and poverty and our 
<br />
families devastated.
<br />
<p>This is a human call that transcends politics, cultures, and 
<br />
religions because we are all impacted by the insanity. Insanity is 
<br />
doing the same thing over and over and thinking the results will be 
<br />
different. We have thought we were powerless, therefore we were 
<br />
powerless. As women, constituting over 51% of the population, we are 
<br />
powerful; our numbers can demand and create the changes that are 
<br />
desperately needed. As women, we have had to do many things in our 
<br />
lives when we didn't know how to do them. Yet we knew they had to be 
<br />
done, so we set our intention and somehow accomplished our goal.
<br />
<p>We also know we can work together - we jump to immediate action in a 
<br />
crisis for our family, friends and neighbors during illness, natural 
<br />
disaster or direct attack. Is not the crisis of all the wars in our 
<br />
world sufficient to take a stand now? Is not the economic crisis 
<br />
created by the philosophy of greed as devastating as any natural 
<br />
disaster?
<br />
<p>Let us all join together on 11-11, in the streets and in spirit, to 
<br />
make the transformation we know in our hearts is needed for us to 
<br />
survive and thrive. The time is Now. In the spirit of celebration, we 
<br />
strike the tone of how we want to live. Fear is a strategy to keep us 
<br />
powerless. Don't fall victim to it. Let the strength of our numbers 
<br />
and commitment show the world we must change now.
<br />
<p>Nobel Plea for Justice &quot;To survive in the world ... we must learn to 
<br />
think in a new way.
<br />
<p>As never before, the future of each depends on the goodness of all.&quot; 
<br />
Nobel Laureates, Nobel Peace Prize Centennial Symposium, December 6, 
<br />
2001
<br />
<p><p>Suggested Actions for Women Strike 11-11
<br />
<p>o Send this notice to everyone you know.
<br />
<p>o Stop work for one day or more to gather and celebrate our 
<br />
connection (as long as it doesn't put you at personal risk or extreme 
<br />
economic hardship.)
<br />
<p>o Wear purple, if possible.
<br />
<p>o Gather peacefully in your town center, on your block or in your 
<br />
living room. Invite others to gather with you or if you can't gather, 
<br />
hold this action in your heart.
<br />
<p>o Have all the bells of your community ring together at 12 noon in 
<br />
your town and ring your own.
<br />
<p>o Choose a specific time for a connecting activity. Make it simple, 
<br />
human and meaningful: meet and greet each other with respect, honor 
<br />
and joy.
<br />
<p>o For large public gatherings please check if you need permits.
<br />
<p>o Create a local fund for women who cannot afford to take a day off.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>What do we want? A new agenda that asks different Questions
<br />
<p>o How can we assure real peace talks in the mid-east immediately?
<br />
<p>o What commitments can leaders make to end homelessness and poverty now?
<br />
<p>o How can funds be diverted from military rule to humane efforts?
<br />
<p>o How can we work towards safety, peace &amp; harmony among all the 
<br />
peoples of the world?
<br />
<p>o When will policies of terrorism, racism, corporate manipulation and 
<br />
government abuse of power cease?
<br />
<p>o What more is needed to support and build the peace economy?o Add 
<br />
your own questions
<br />
<p><p><p><p>Why 11-11 as the day for Striking &amp; Celebration of Our Humanity?
<br />
<p>Very importantly 11-11 is Remembrance Day for Europe and Veterans Day 
<br />
for the United States, the day to celebrate the end of all wars, the 
<br />
end of World War I in 1918. Obviously, that did not happen. Let's 
<br />
make that happen now.
<br />
<p><p><p>Why Participate in Women Strike 11-11?
<br />
<p>This is a simple action that everyone can do, with little funding or 
<br />
planning, and most importantly the only affiliation needed is to be a 
<br />
member of the human race who is fed up with the horrors and stupidity 
<br />
of war, greed and deprivation.
<br />
<p>Our current political, social, religious, civic and economic 
<br />
activities and theories have not been able to stop the many horrors 
<br />
in our world. Women Strike 11-11 is not presenting any specific 
<br />
philosophy except that we are all human and we are all affected by 
<br />
the insanity. The very act of coming together will accomplish much: 
<br />
show the world just how great the numbers are who want change, 
<br />
provide the foundation for new ideas, meet and greet our community.
<br />
<p>We cannot wait in fear and trembling, praying for the &quot;powers that 
<br />
be&quot; to change. We must live that change and announce it to the world. 
<br />
Gandhi and Martin Luther King achieved change - we are the change. A 
<br />
day of striking from work and gathering to celebrate will ignite this 
<br />
change. When people can hold the vision of a world in joy with basic 
<br />
human needs met, they change their lives. When enough people do this, 
<br />
the world changes.
<br />
<p><p><p><p>Genesis of Women Strike 11-11
<br />
<p>This idea could have come from any number of people or groups 
<br />
worldwide who are deeply concerned with the status of our world. 
<br />
However, a small group of 10 women, aged 35 to 94 were
<br />
meeting bi-weekly for 2 months because of their frustration and sense 
<br />
of hopelessness with the world situations. These women brainstormed 
<br />
Women Strike. They realized that the power of the Internet and 
<br />
individual networking could generate the numbers to make an impact.
<br />
<p><p><p>Reach &amp; Impact of Women Strike 11-11
<br />
<p>o In the first week we have contacts in 23 countries. Please extend 
<br />
our reach around the world.
<br />
<p>o The goal is to have individuals and groups worldwide from all walks 
<br />
of life, cultures, religions, political, civic, and social 
<br />
affiliations to spread the word and participate in the Women Strike.
<br />
<p>o The more women in communities worldwide who participate in small 
<br />
and large groups, and notify the press in their area, the more 
<br />
effective Women Strike 11-11 will be.
<br />
<p>Please let us know what you're doing through our website or by 
<br />
writing or calling.
<br />
<p>Women Strike was birthed in the home of a 94 year old woman who 
<br />
remembers that when she was ten years old she was filled with the 
<br />
incredible joy of celebrating 11-11-1918 which was declared Armistice 
<br />
Day. The joy was that this was the end of the war that was promised 
<br />
to be the end all wars.
<br />
<p>Let us fulfill that promise!
