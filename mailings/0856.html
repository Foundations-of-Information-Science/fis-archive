<p>
FISers--
<br />
<p>I announce herein the start of the final session. I propose that this
<br />
one be somewhat different in nature.
<br />
<p>It is our final session, and it would make the year's effort more
<br />
worthwhile if we could produce some conclusions. I propose that
<br />
instead of seeking concurrence on what we all agree on, let us
<br />
instead crisply identify the open controversies by focusing on
<br />
apparent fundamental differences. It is my experience that this is at
<br />
least as valuable as the consensus results and has the benefit of
<br />
better structuring research decisions.
<br />
<p>This is also our &quot;holiday&quot; session, for most of us, and I expect we
<br />
may have less opportunistic exchange as a result. So let's aim for
<br />
statements that start with the papers at hand and leverage them to
<br />
reach a sense of where lie the differences in approach, open issues
<br />
and controversies.
<br />
<p>Fortunately we have papers that are not only interesting, but
<br />
particularly apt for this purpose.
<br />
<p>Terry Marks interprets the FIS problem as one centered on reflection,
<br />
and suggests an informed examination of myth. I'm personally
<br />
sympathetic to this &quot;new science&quot; introduction into the conference.
<br />
The paper focuses on self-reference and is itself folded thrice (the
<br />
myth, the story of Jung, the nature of the problem). Because it is a
<br />
psychoanalytic approach, there is an implicit notion of &quot;history&quot; and
<br />
(reflected) memory behind the less fundamental idea of information.
<br />
<p>Wolfgang Hofkirchner's paper is in the process of being uploaded to
<br />
the site, I believe. He starts at roughly the same place: information
<br />
as a manifold multidimensional entity. He instead sketches an
<br />
approach that leverages structured evolution (meaning evolution with
<br />
causality rather than highly non-deterministic mechanisms) to
<br />
structure the (three) types of information. Because the problem is
<br />
reflexive, the same symmetries overlap with the types of evolution
<br />
guiding a similar, reflected organization. Rather clever I think.
<br />
<p>Karl Javorszky starts from apposite opposition to this idea with an
<br />
equally seductive notion: instead of starting from the effect of
<br />
information, starting from the notion of information in the system
<br />
and examining its behavior. He recognizes set-theoretic properties of
<br />
information entities. (To my mind, these could possibly map to the
<br />
symmetry types of the others in some way.) That gives Karl what he
<br />
needs to develop/discover mechanics which seem to cover many of the
<br />
problems of information transfer in biological systems. Karl has
<br />
advanced these ideas in his mails, but the paper is a more complete
<br />
presentation.
<br />
<p>Morris Villarroel's ideas seem to share the same basic philosophy of
<br />
working to comprehend the mechanics of information per se. His
<br />
conceptual hooks are partitions, a group-theoretic notion rather than
<br />
set-theoretic. And rather than the combinatorials of Javorsky, Morris
<br />
employs a symmetric application of logical composition. This has huge
<br />
advantages in inheriting geometric mechanics that (one suspects) can
<br />
be found in biological interactions. Surely this is close to existing
<br />
mechanics in the Kaufmann-influenced community.  But it raises the
<br />
mathematics from numerical to logical so that &quot;primitives&quot; are less
<br />
mathematically pure. I wonder what the group's feel is on these
<br />
tradeoffs.
<br />
<p>Jos» Bea and Pedro take a tack distinct from these two. Instead of
<br />
looking at the comprehensive world of information, they look at a
<br />
single, well-defined but poorly explained problem within information.
<br />
This philosophy of investigation has a strong pedigree for providing
<br />
paradigm-busting insights. Their domain is that of social discourse
<br />
and the problem is humor. I admit that this paper, actually the
<br />
approach underlying this paper, has made me rethink a few things. The
<br />
idea is laughter (the actual sound) as a sonically characterizable
<br />
utterance with information content, compared to &quot;conventional&quot;
<br />
utterances. Not surprisingly, Shannon's entropy metric fails.
<br />
<p>But wait! We have another paradigm-busting candidate. Antonio
<br />
GarcÃa-Olivares and Pedro Vidal present a quite similar examination.
<br />
Again it is of &quot;unconventional&quot; information transfer, couples dancing
<br />
within a well-defined vocabulary like the tango. A variety of
<br />
communicative types and modes are noted. The notion of &quot;dance&quot; in
<br />
biological encounters is somewhat enticing. What do you think?
<br />
<p>(Dear authors, forgive me for any unintended slights, misreadings or
<br />
clumsy tramping through your work.)
<br />
<p>Are we better off with set theoretic, group or category theoretic
<br />
foundations? And how pure should our working abstractions be anyway?
<br />
<p>Are we better off thinking about information itself, or about its
<br />
effects within the system? What legacies should we jettison? And
<br />
along those lines: do we accept the reflexive nature of information
<br />
as a concept worth leveraging, or engineer the reflexiveness out of
<br />
the (mechanics of the) science?
<br />
<p>Are we better off looking at the entire behavior or a few vexing
<br />
problem areas? If so, what are they, and in general are we better off
<br />
working from the social or the biological domain?
<br />
<p>Do we need new abstractions? Are these discovered or engineered and
<br />
which among the FIS presentations so far seem promising to you?
<br />
(Don't vote for yourself!)
<br />
<p>Do we need to redefine the problem for the next FIS adventure?
<br />
<p>As always, unless the list traffic is quite slow please limit to two
<br />
postings per week (excepting announcements).
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
