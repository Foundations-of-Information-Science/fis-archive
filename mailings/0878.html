<p>
The new year 2003 started only two days ago after being celebrated 
<br />
the end of 2002, which was an uncertain period seriously disturbed by 
<br />
threatening retrograde steps given by authorities of highly civilized 
<br />
countries. However 2003 began with good wishes expressed by millions 
<br />
of people but without recognizing that planning at present a better 
<br />
future makes INDISPENSABLE to comprehend better and better the past 
<br />
by means of a scientific examination of the events that happened and 
<br />
determined the trajectory for humankind. This scientific approach can 
<br />
be considered the most urgent task for all the researchers, experts, 
<br />
scholars, educators - and also students - as members of the elite 
<br />
intellectual that hypothetically until today might lead humankind 
<br />
from now onward to create a reasonable or humanitarian way forward. 
<br />
Such a kind of approach must allow everybody to recognize what kind 
<br />
of systems were constituted, what sort of feed-back and feed-forward 
<br />
interactions were consciously or unconsciously implemented, whether 
<br />
the information employed was truthful enough, what misinformation was 
<br />
purposefully invented, whether the organization of actions was 
<br />
sufficiently ethical.
<br />
<p>In fact since several decades ago good wishes for another New Year 
<br />
are expressed at the beginning of each January together with the 
<br />
announcement that magnificent scientific achievements that generate 
<br />
superb technological innovations keep determining the successful 
<br />
trajectory of the Western Civilization, despite huge and 
<br />
contradictory political disturbances. However it is not mentioned and 
<br />
even less is recognized that this troubled trajectory has been 
<br />
generated by a warring spirit institutionalized as the 'official' 
<br />
frame of mind needed for consolidating a paradoxical success. Such a 
<br />
kind of success has determined in the past the collapse of previous 
<br />
civilizations. Despite worrying fear and frustrating anger it seems 
<br />
convenient to have always in mind the causality of the main warfare 
<br />
events of the 20th century, for searching continuously, along every 
<br />
whole year, how to make functional the good wishes for the future of 
<br />
humankind.
<br />
<p>The First World War (1914 - 1918). It was caused by vested interests 
<br />
of empowered European decision-makers, who could not solve other way 
<br />
their conflicting ambitions as every one intended to expand its 
<br />
colonial domain without being restricted by the others. The war 
<br />
erupted without being noticed that it was a conflict conceived and 
<br />
encouraged through childish interpretations and simplistic arguments.
<br />
<p>The Second World War (1939 - 1945). It was engendered also by 
<br />
conflicting ambitions of many more empowered decision-makers but was 
<br />
in addition stimulated by the economic recession that in the 1930's 
<br />
affected the Western economies. This recession propitiated fascist 
<br />
organizations in Europe and the Japanese Empire to assume that they 
<br />
were entitled to expand their dominion taking over land, resources, 
<br />
and population of neighbor countries.
<br />
<p>This war was definitely encouraged by the expansionist colonialism 
<br />
that has prevailed until today since five centuries ago. But was also 
<br />
stimulated by a racist ideology conceived for eliminating massively 
<br />
people who were considered undesirable competitors. For the first 
<br />
time in the history of humankind technological innovations carried 
<br />
out with the support of scientific research were employed as 
<br />
TERRORIST weapons against innocent people. Modern war began when a 
<br />
German submarine sunk without warning the steamer Lusitana loaded 
<br />
with many hundred passengers, German and Spanish fascist organized 
<br />
blitz attacks with bombardiers against civilian areas in cities 
<br />
followed by destruction of German cities by American and British 
<br />
bombardment. Its first stage culminated with two atomic bombs dropped 
<br />
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki where 200,000 people were massively and 
<br />
effectively killed
<br />
<p>Only high rank soldiers and narrow-minded politicians still today 
<br />
pretend to justify the inordinate violence and irrationality that 
<br />
characterizes the dynamics of the Western civilization since the 
<br />
1940s.
<br />
<p>Leaders of winners and losers of the 2nd World War since around 1947 
<br />
realized, during the reconstruction of all what had been skillfully 
<br />
destroyed, that it was too expensive and rather ineffective to 
<br />
maintain civilizing intentions fighting among them for determining 
<br />
what parts of the world would control everyone. Evidently they 
<br />
discovered that instead of continue fighting they could agree 
<br />
explicitly or de facto in making a world distribution for 
<br />
implementing a modern colonialism that would allow each one to 
<br />
continue its expansion, though restricted while trying to respect 
<br />
their conflicting interests. Once again, after recognizing the 
<br />
failure of some of their previous adventures, several decision-makers 
<br />
recognized that it was necessary to change the colonizing procedures 
<br />
in order to impede the change of their colonizing motivations 
<br />
determined for the sake of making any kind of monetary profits. The 
<br />
Third World War (1947 - 1990) arose through clever invention as a 
<br />
non-declared warfare skillfully organized against all the other 
<br />
peoples in order to modernize the colonialism that started in 1492.
<br />
<p>Along only four decades the Neocolonialism that emerged through a 
<br />
'modernized' ideology has been implemented by means of new kinds of 
<br />
weapons constituted through economic procedures decorated with 
<br />
scientific and technological aids and conditioned by financial 
<br />
conditions. Most countries are no longer considered colonies after 
<br />
being simply classified as developing or less developed or 
<br />
underdeveloped lands inhabited by people whom their economic and 
<br />
social progress is offered, if the respective governors accept to 
<br />
implement R&amp;D (research and development) policies. These policies 
<br />
have been and still are political tools that most rulers usually 
<br />
accept as they belong to the middle class democratically or 
<br />
despotically empowered, but always bribed by means of refined and 
<br />
sophisticated procedures in order to control the behavior of the 
<br />
lower classes. These policies intend de facto to increase 
<br />
systematically the exploitation and exportation of natural resources 
<br />
comprised the labor carried out by the working class, in order to 
<br />
develop continuously the highly civilized way of life. A life 
<br />
conceived for a continuous entertainment, distraction and enjoyment 
<br />
of the upper class of rich and poor countries, who must necessarily 
<br />
control effectively the implementation of the whole R&amp;D, whatever the 
<br />
means and consequences.
<br />
<p>The neocolonialism has made non-developed and developing countries 
<br />
and the lower classes to become more and more economically subjected, 
<br />
technologically dependent and politically subordinated to the 
<br />
interests and motivations of decision-makers of rich countries 
<br />
engaged in maintaining the civilizing trends.
<br />
<p>It has been until today a peaceful (?) warring peculiarly complicated 
<br />
in every country by the empowered elite, which intends always to be 
<br />
efficient and loyal accomplices or at least servants that hope their 
<br />
personal ambitions may be satisfied by the modern colonizers. 
<br />
However, in many cases the victims - people of countries that had 
<br />
been colonized several decades or even centuries before - have not 
<br />
forgotten their past. They continuously recognize that they should 
<br />
have the right to organize on their own the management of their 
<br />
affairs for satisfying their concerns in the land where they live. 
<br />
The meritorious trajectory of Emiliano Zapata in México, Mahatma 
<br />
Ghandi in India, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and Nelson Mandela in South 
<br />
Africa have been continuously reproduced by others who fought against 
<br />
colonial and elitist intentions while learning to be aware of what 
<br />
the rights of common people are. As soon as they are considered as 
<br />
terrorists, it becomes necessary to use traditional weapons for 
<br />
killing leaders and followers and make not only possible but feasible 
<br />
the implementation of the progressive neocolonialism.
<br />
<p>The so called Cold War between western countries and the Soviet Union 
<br />
was in fact a confrontation among two colonizing forces, which helped 
<br />
to hid better and better their real intentions. Meanwhile the 
<br />
division of the world in areas conventionally assigned to each one 
<br />
was organized rather successfully for them in order to continue 
<br />
assuring their respective expansionism, but trying to reduce the use 
<br />
of weapons and armies when there were disagreements among them. The 
<br />
economic transactions have been gradually better and better 
<br />
determined by means of decisions made according to a continuously 
<br />
modernized warring spirit, which is economically, financially and 
<br />
commercially implemented, though unable to recognize that everything 
<br />
may collapse soon as most restricting factors are not even noticed.
