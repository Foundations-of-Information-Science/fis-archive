                    <br />
                <p>12 Questions about relations between molecular bionetworks and information
                    <br />
                    theory
                    <br />
                <p>(by Jerry L.R. Chandler)
                    <br />
                <p>I agreed to write a brief introduction to the subject, knowing that I could
                    <br />
                    not do justice to such a complex topic in such a short time. As little is
                    <br />
                    known about the subject, I chose to introduce topics and to pose questions
                    <br />
                    about potential relations. The questions are significant but not ordered
                    <br />
                    by importance or priority. Hopefully, participants will contribute to
                    <br />
                    exploring the meanings of the questions and addressing conceivable
                    <br />
                    approaches to answers. Perhaps one objective could be to discuss the
                    <br />
                    relative importance of the 12 questions.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of molecular bionetworks is a modern concept. The
                    <br />
                    development of this concept will continue into the indefinite future. That
                    <br />
                    is to say, the concept is, at present, well defined but in a primitive or
                    <br />
                    early stage of development.
                    <br />
                <p>1. From an informational perspective what would constitute a definitive
                    <br />
                    theory of the information content of molecular bionetworks?
                    <br />
                <p>Historically, in the 1840&#x2019;s, Kirchoff&#x2019;s theory of flow in electrical
                    <br />
                    networks grounds the metaphor of the conceptual framework for molecular
                    <br />
                    bionetworks. However, the relatively simplicity of the flow of electrons
                    <br />
                    in comparison to the flow of life restricts the analogy
                    <br />
                    severely. Nevertheless, biomolecules are composed from electrical
                    <br />
                    particles and certain electron flow patterns are intrinsic to metabolic
                    <br />
                    networks in living systems.
                    <br />
                <p>2. From the perspective of information, how is it possible that bionetworks
                    <br />
                    construct the informed flows of electrical current flow and how is it
                    <br />
                    related metabolic flows?
                    <br />
                <p>Historically, the investigation of empirical basis of molecular bionetworks
                    <br />
                    (metabolism) started shortly after Pastuer&#x2019;s pioneering experiments on the
                    <br />
                    causes of fermentation (1870&#x2019;s). At that time, the fermentation of grape
                    <br />
                    juice was difficult to control but of great economic importance. (Bad wine
                    <br />
                    sells cheaply!) Quantitative analysis of yeast fermentations showed that
                    <br />
                    each molecule of glucose generated two molecules of the 2-carbon alcohol
                    <br />
                    and two molecules of carbon dioxide. The yeast cell informed the specific
                    <br />
                    destruction of the sugar. (If the 6-carbon sugar was merely burned, then
                    <br />
                    it produced exactly six molecules of carbon dioxide.) Thus, the
                    <br />
                    thermodynamic question of why the yeast cell did not completely burn up the
                    <br />
                    6- carbon sugar entirely into carbon dioxide arose.
                    <br />
                <p>3. From an informational perspective, what does this incomplete
                    <br />
                    fermentation process of glucose suggest about the role of thermodynamics in
                    <br />
                    living processes?
                    <br />
                <p>Continuing with the historical roots of biomolecular networks, early in the
                    <br />
                    20 th Century, the exact chemical pathway between glucose and alcohol and
                    <br />
                    CO2 was decoded. The code of the cell for fermentation was that each
                    <br />
                    chemical reaction was catalysed by an informed agents,
                    <br />
                    termed &#x201c;zwishenferments&#x201d;. These agents are now known as enzymes. Thus,
                    <br />
                    the question of how a cell knows how to ferment sugar was regressed to a
                    <br />
                    deeper informational question: How does an enzyme know how to inform a
                    <br />
                    chemical change?
                    <br />
                <p>4. From an informational perspective, what is the nature of the code that
                    <br />
                    an enzyme contains such that it conducts an informed catalytic process?
                    <br />
                <p>Continuing with the historical perspective, by the 1950s, it was known that
                    <br />
                    biological information was carried in chemical sequences, enzymes were
                    <br />
                    composed from amino acid sequences and that nucleic acids were composed
                    <br />
                    from nucleotides. In the 1960&#x2019;s, the convergence of experimental work in
                    <br />
                    genetics, biochemistry, x-ray crystallography, nutrition and Shannon&#x2019;s
                    <br />
                    coding theory, generated the hypothesis that biological information is
                    <br />
                    encoded in chemical structures. This hypothesis remains intact
                    <br />
                    today. During the period from 1970 to the present, methods for determining
                    <br />
                    the chemical sequences of biomolecules were developed and
                    <br />
                    automated. Today, sequencing of microgram quantities of biomolecules is
                    <br />
                    routine. The complete DNA sequences of hundreds of biological species are
                    <br />
                    known. The sequences of tens of thousands of proteins are known. The
                    <br />
                    sizes of proteins, the so-to-speak &#x201c;cybernetic agents,&#x201d; are often hundreds
                    <br />
                    as time as large as the small molecules that they control. Interpolation
                    <br />
                    between protein sequences and DNA sequences are routinely conducted via
                    <br />
                    computer programs. The relation between the information in DNA or in
                    <br />
                    proteins and the substrates for catalytic reactions is deeply mysterious.
                    <br />
                <p>5. From an informational perspective, given solely the DNA and protein
                    <br />
                    sequences of an organism, what can we say about the biological functioning
                    <br />
                    of the organism?
                    <br />
                <p>The classification of chemical structures has been given a new set of names
                    <br />
                    in the past decade. Genomics becomes the study of the genome, the DNA
                    <br />
                    sequences and properties; protonomic becomes the study of protein
                    <br />
                    structures and properties, metabolonomics becomes the study of &#x201c;small&#x201d;
                    <br />
                    molecules where the sequences of atoms are relatively short. (The use of
                    <br />
                    the Greek root, &#x201c;nomos&#x201d;, as in law (for example, in autonomy), is somewhat
                    <br />
                    misleading in this context.)
                    <br />
                <p>Biomolecular networks consist of all the molecules in a cell. One crucial
                    <br />
                    feature of such networks is the capacity to generate biological functions.
                    <br />
                <p>6. From an informational perspective, what is the nature of the information
                    <br />
                    content of a collection of molecules such that they generate biological
                    <br />
                    function?
                    <br />
                <p>A second crucial feature of such networks is the capacity, in an
                    <br />
                    appropriate ecosystem, to reproduce themselves with exactly the same
                    <br />
                    chemical structures.
                    <br />
                <p>7. From an informational perspective, what is the nature of the relational
                    <br />
                    interactions between the interior and the exterior of an organism such that
                    <br />
                    the information is reproduced?
                    <br />
                <p>8. From an informational perspective, is the reproduction of a cell a
                    <br />
                    mathematical calculation?
                    <br />
                <p>Biomolecular networks function in time. In humans, the generation of
                    <br />
                    temporal networks of the heart, the brain, the menses, and so forth are
                    <br />
                    intricate flows of orderly information that manifest themselves in regular
                    <br />
                    and chaotic rhythms. In simple unicellular organisms, the growth rate and
                    <br />
                    cellular division can follow strict rhythms. Such rhythms can be
                    <br />
                    modulated, altered, extended or stopped by chemical agents that are foreign
                    <br />
                    to the bionetwork.
                    <br />
                <p>9. From an informational perspective, what are the relations between
                    <br />
                    chemical structures and temporal rhythms? What is the information content
                    <br />
                    of a chemical rhythm?
                    <br />
                    In what sense are the rhythms of temporal chemical relations the source of
                    <br />
                    biological information? What is the information content of a chemical rhythm?
                    <br />
                <p>Early in the history of biology, organisms were classified based on
                    <br />
                    categories, more or less following Aristotelian conceptualization of
                    <br />
                    Phyphrian trees, choices of potential properties. The ten Aristotelian
                    <br />
                    categories, the ten highest genera are listed as: substance, quantity,
                    <br />
                    quality, relation, place, time, position, state, and action, being acted
                    <br />
                    on. Biological function is related to these categories. I presume that a
                    <br />
                    property of the molecular bionetwork encodes and decodes information
                    <br />
                    concerning these genera.
                    <br />
                <p>10. From modern information theory, how can we improve the Aristotelian
                    <br />
                    categorization of properties of organisms, based on the qualitative and
                    <br />
                    quantitative attributes of the biomolecular networks? How should the
                    <br />
                    concept of information be conceptualized such that it will illuminate
                    <br />
                    communication about molecular bionetworks or biological function?
                    <br />
                <p>Each molecular bionetwork is specific to the particular species in which it
                    <br />
                    exists. However, the similarity of bionetworks roughly parallels the
                    <br />
                    separation of species in the &#x2018;tree of life.&#x201d; Virtually all
                    <br />
                    self-reproducing species include a common set of small molecules, amino
                    <br />
                    acids, fats, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. The degree of similarity of
                    <br />
                    sequences of proteins, RNA and DNA vary with the &#x201c;tree of life&#x201d;
                    <br />
                    separation. Indeed, classification of species, genera and families are now
                    <br />
                    based on calculation of sequence similarity.
                    <br />
                <p>11. From an informational perspective, what is the significance of the
                    <br />
                    sequence similarities for the theory of biological information? For the
                    <br />
                    concepts of encoding and decoding of molecular bionetworks?
                    <br />
                <p>One approach to the partial analysis of the meaning of the genetic code was
                    <br />
                    developed from Shannon&#x2019;s theory by Dr. Thomas Schneider.

                        href="../../www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/default.htm">http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/</a>
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The theory is specific for one aspect of the molecular bionetwork, namely
                    <br />
                    binding of proteins to DNA. His website provides a detailed account of
                    <br />
                    Schneider&#x2019;s philosophy.
                    <br />
                <p>12. From an informational perspective, the encoding processes for DNA &#x2013;
                    <br />
                    protein relationships are somehow related to Shannon&#x2019;s theory. What are
                    <br />
                    the relations between this sort of encoding and other metabolic
                    <br />
                    encoding? In particular, can we imagine a catalytic &#x2013; type of encoding
                    <br />
                    that parallels the genetic encoding?

                <p>Introductory Remarks 2:
                    <br />
                <p>The Natural Computation Perspective
                    <br />
                <p>(by Kevin Kirby)
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>If anything can be called a &quot;science of the artificial&quot; it is Computer
                    <br />
                    Science, or so one might think. In fact, such thinking is incorrect. And
                    <br />
                    it is precisely in the field of biology -- with molecular biology as the
                    <br />
                    best exemplar-- where a clearer understanding of Natural Computation will
                    <br />
                    be so valuable.
                    <br />
                <p>The initial encounter between computing and nature happens in the
                    <br />
                    computational modeling of natural systems. For example, we now see many
                    <br />
                    object-oriented models of ecosystems. More deeply into computer science, we
                    <br />
                    find questions such as, for example, whether a natural language has
                    <br />
                    such-and-such a computational property (e.g. whether Dutch is a
                    <br />
                    context-free language). But beyond providing a way to talk about models of
                    <br />
                    nature, some have viewed computer science as saying something about nature
                    <br />
                    itself, constraining it in some way. A very strong form of the
                    <br />
                    Church-Turing thesis can be taken as a physical law. And the theory of
                    <br />
                    quantum information has made the &quot;it from bit&quot; slogan quite precise. It is
                    <br />
                    in these latter senses that a true &#x201c;natural computer science&#x201d; begins to
                    <br />
                    take shape.
                    <br />
                <p>One way to further this approach is to turn to biological systems, and take
                    <br />
                    a look at the simulation relation. How do we say a biological system
                    <br />
                    computes X? Well, we see if there is a dynamics-preserving mapping between
                    <br />
                    inputs and states of the biological system and a given formal system for X.
                    <br />
                    This relation is usually written as a commutative diagram. The simulation
                    <br />
                    relation is central in automata theory and was recast into a
                    <br />
                    category-theoretic framework by Arbib and Goguen (taking different
                    <br />
                    approaches). But the notion of a mapping between a biological system and
                    <br />
                    a formal system, seems to be, at first glance, a category mistake! As soon
                    <br />
                    as one identifies a fragment of nature as a system, one has locked in some
                    <br />
                    set of states, and it is hard to separate the true computational power of a
                    <br />
                    living system from what accrues merely to our conventional state
                    <br />
                    assignment. This is taken up nicely by the philosopher David Chalmers in a
                    <br />
                    response to a very strong statement at the conventionality end by Hilary
                    <br />
                    Putnam. (One could see this as a recasting of the debate in Plato's
                    <br />
                    Cratylus in computational terms!)
                    <br />
                <p>This tension between the formal and the material seems to lie at the heart
                    <br />
                    of the field of natural computing. The work of Michael Conrad emphasized
                    <br />
                    the special role of biological material to explain the fantastic outcomes
                    <br />
                    of evolution, as opposed to any power inhering in the class of relatively
                    <br />
                    simple Darwinian algorithms. In the mutation-absorption model of the
                    <br />
                    enzyme, we can begin to see how computational power emerges from the
                    <br />
                    breakdown in the simulation relation, by the failure of commutativity (and,
                    <br />
                    in the mathematical sense, the creation of torsion). This seems to be the
                    <br />
                    vexing locus of this new field: clarifying precisely what happens when
                    <br />
                    formal systems fail to track changes in fragments of nature.
                    <br />
                <p>In this FIS session on molecular bionetworks, I think we may have the
                    <br />
                    opportunity to find a clearer understanding here. Jerry Chandler's work
                    <br />
                    deals with the connection between the formal (or symbolic) and the
                    <br />
                    biological, and it seems these two perspectives may be mutually
                    <br />
                    illuminating, and give us all the chance for some brainstorming in this
                    <br />
                    largely unexplored area. Perhaps natural computing takes us back to the
                    <br />
                    medieval meaning of natural as &quot;sublunar&quot; (to bring up term recirculated
                    <br />
                    lately by Pedro Marijuan), dealing with the mutable substances down here
                    <br />
                    under the orbit of the moon, illuminated by, but separated from, the
                    <br />
                    immutable forms of the celestial world.
                    <br />
                <p>One final introductory thought. In imputing computing to a fragment of
                    <br />
                    nature -- a ribosome, say -- we should not view ourselves as reducing it to
                    <br />
                    the apparently impoverished level of a Turing machine or a Pentium 4.
                    <br />
                    Computer Science is in its infancy; the ribosome, the cell, the ecosystem:
                    <br />
                    these are all better exemplars of computational wonder than our humble
                    <br />
                    devices. If only we had a theory&#x2026;
                    <br />
