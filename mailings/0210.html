Dear Pedro
<br />
<p>To &quot;make sense of&quot; I think is the key word - but also the thing we do not understand very well. the particular historical unique circumstances are surely decisive for selecting the survival of a new structure or selforganizing system. But as soon as we de
<br />
al with living systems the strange concept of 'meaning' and 'sense' or 'signification' becomes important. this is partly driven by the social communicative aspect but this has as a prerequisite the individual phenomenological world og feeling, think and w
<br />
illing which we have so much difficulty to make 'laws' for. Further Popper denies the existence of deterministc historical laws.
<br />
<p>Now as I see it 'information' - as it is used in information science - has nothing to do with meaning and sense or signification , which is based in semiotic theories of cognition and communication in living systems. In general we have problems of using t
<br />
he mechanical law-concept in life sciences.
<br />
<p>If we are going to speal about 'infor-laws' I think that they would be non-deterministic and on basis of what Peirce calls 'Firstness' ,which is the potential field of feeeling and qualia. Peirce talks of 'habits' and speaks of statistical tendencies.
<br />
<p>On the basis of evolutionary and ecological thinking using selection theory going into socio-communication on a basis of meaning we might be able to do something. This is what some of Niklas Luhmann's work is about, where he operates with biological, psyc
<br />
hological and social systems autopoiesis (may be it is better to talk of organisational closure as Varela and Mingers suggests). Luhmann work with information and meaning as two different concepts.
<br />
<p>The part of his huge work I have read and understood I think there are many valuable things, but also that his meaning concept is insufficiant founded and that his understanding - at least  of Peirce's - semiotics is not sufficient. So future work should 
<br />
try to integrate the progresses he has made.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Best wishes
<br />

Dear FISers
<br />
<p>Some aspects of Gottfried and Soeren's comments on selforganization can be
<br />
discussed together with Bob's last message. My private contention with
<br />
selforganization and with complexity relates to the lack of consideration
<br />
by these two trends (or just only one?) towards the special &quot;fluid&quot;
<br />
structural properties of life in its cellular, organismic, social realms.
<br />
Central to this fluidity is the coupling between the engines of
<br />
self-production (OK, more or less close to selforgan., except the
<br />
&quot;sequence&quot; assumption), and the engines of self-degradation (unknown for
<br />
self.org. views).
<br />
<p>The &quot;fluid&quot; living structure appears as the net result of both types of
<br />
processes, adaptively coupled. For instance, protein synthesis / protein
<br />
degradation. Cell-cycle / cell-apoptosis. Synapsis growth / synapsis
<br />
disappearance. Companies creation / companies destruction.... And the role
<br />
of the communicational processes or info phenomena would consist on
<br />
governing the mutual coupling of both productive and destructive &quot;engines&quot;,
<br />
providing their adaptive internal/external control, and an impressive
<br />
organizational freedom in every realm.
<br />
<p>Why does the US economy create every year 1.000.000 new companies, and of
<br />
these only 100.000 or 150.000 will survive more than one year? Why protein
<br />
synthesis works more or less the same? Why apoptosis, etc.? And why power
<br />
laws emerge in all these fields? This more or less can lead to introduce
<br />
some notion of &quot;relevance&quot;, as the info impact of an item on the underlying
<br />
&quot;fluid&quot; strutures--altering their productive-degradative balance of
<br />
processes by way of the infostructures surrounding both...
<br />
<p>And here it seeems that Bob«s emphasis on VEMS can (partially) be
<br />
reconsidered. For social complexity becomes affected particularly by a FEW
<br />
items, of rather heterogenous nature, but RELEVANT to the social fluid
<br />
structures, and not generically by any external-internal event or
<br />
orverarching social entropy law (perhaps I am wrong here). It is the story
<br />
of AGRICULTURE, NUMBERS, WRITING, CLOCKS, PRINTING, STEAM ENGINES,
<br />
COMPUTERS... that touch the very &quot;info heart&quot; of societies and build up the
<br />
royal road to complexity. Paying attention to the fact that societies can
<br />
also go backwards (plenty of historical cases, even nowadays: Russia)
<br />
<p>If the above could be articulated into a coherent discourse, implying new
<br />
conceptions and background on the nature of information, and far away from
<br />
its present intuitive rough and unarticulated form, perhaps a strong thesis
<br />
could be discussed. With only the present complexity stuff, I am afraid we
<br />
cannot. Complexity is finally unable to make sense of &quot;relevance&quot; --why
<br />
books historically lead to Renais-sance, and why computers are producing
<br />
the present Chaos-sance...
<br />
<p>bests
