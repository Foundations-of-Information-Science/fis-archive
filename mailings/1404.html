<p>
Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>Sorry for my quite sporadic participation, mainly due to extensive traveling
<br />
throuhg the last year. As a physicist, however, I cannot abstain from taking
<br />
part in the discussion regarding information and entropy. The following is a
<br />
set of somewhat disjoint statements which I humbly offer for discussion in
<br />
the context of the current topic.
<br />
<p>Linguistic discourse
<br />
<p>1. In-formation as a word refers to assigning or creating a form (shape).
<br />
Thus, Information concerns a violation of uniformity (uni-formity,
<br />
shapelesness) of the system.  An absolutely uniorm space-time does not allow
<br />
any means of measuring distance (coordinates) or time (intervals). Hence, in
<br />
such uniform space-time space and time vanish.
<br />
<p>Physical discourse
<br />
<p>2. Any information is necessarily connected with interaction. Th
<br />
interactions could be divided into two main types.
<br />
3. The first, termed here dynamic (D) interactions cause non-uniformity of
<br />
the system. An example of such interaction is ordering of spins in the
<br />
magnetic crystals when the magnetic field is applied. In this case the
<br />
created non-uniformity is anisotropy, an existence of preferred direction.
<br />
4. The second, termed thermodynamic (T) interactions, on the contrary,
<br />
increase the uniformity of the system. An example may be an interaction of
<br />
two objects of different temperature put in direct contact so that, in the
<br />
course of time, their temperatures equilibrate.
<br />
5. D-interactions create (convey) information. As the entropy is a measure
<br />
of the &quot;uniformness&quot; of the system, such interactions consequently decrease
<br />
entropy.
<br />
6. T-interactions create (increase) entropy, increasing uniformness of the
<br />
system. Thus, the system of two objects in direct contact becomes more
<br />
uniform as their temperatures equilibrate.
<br />
7. The paradox of the statistical mechanics is that elementary
<br />
D-interactions of molecules in a macroscopic object lead to an integral
<br />
T-interaction (thermal equilibration with the growth of entropy) in this
<br />
object.
<br />
8. In my opinion, to deal with this paradox it is important to introduce a
<br />
concept of contextual tokenization of information.
<br />
9. Any information can be perceived only in a context. Tokenization is a
<br />
process of information perception by a finite context, conscious or not.
<br />
10. Tokenization is a &quot;method&quot; of compressing information (data into
<br />
knowledge). An example of tokenization is human language, which is typically
<br />
based on a large but finite dictionary. The words are tokens and they
<br />
replace the expanded explanations of their meanings in a text.
<br />
11. Tokenization is where the main distinction between information,
<br />
complexity and entropy lies. To illustrate, Let us compare two uniform
<br />
systems. One is a vessel with gas, another is a crystal. Both systems
<br />
possess some sort of uniformity and, hence, low information content. Indeed,
<br />
in the gas vessel each small volume is macroscopically indistinguishable
<br />
from another. In an (ideal) crystal, each elementary cell is
<br />
insistinguishable from another. However, the crystal is a system with low
<br />
entropy while gas is that of high entropy. The answer is that
<br />
microscopically the crystal can be toenized into description of an
<br />
elementary cell plus the number of repetitions in three directions. In the
<br />
gas, however, microscopically all the elementary volumes are different and
<br />
it is IN PRINCIPLE impossible to describe each of them precisely. Hence,
<br />
tokenization is impossible and entropy is high.
<br />
12. Let us discuss the information content in In both systems. In the
<br />
crystal the information content is low, as the tokenization is &quot;poor&quot;,
<br />
containing only the elementary cell structure and number of repeats. A
<br />
linguistic analogy may be a text where the same word is repeated many times,
<br />
and no other words are used.
<br />
13. In the gas vessel the information content is also low, but not because
<br />
of poor &quot;tokenization&quot; language but because, the system being &quot;random&quot;,
<br />
tokenization fails. A linguistic analogy is a text in which each word
<br />
appears only once, hence its deciphering (without a dictionary) becomes
<br />
impossible.
<br />
14. Tokenization necessarily implies that the tokens repeat, and their
<br />
number is &quot;tractable&quot; by the context (receiver).
<br />
15. Hence there are two types of uniformity, that both have low information
<br />
context. One of them is highly entropic (infinite tokenization dictionary),
<br />
another is low entropy (small tokenization dictionary).
<br />
16. In between these two situations there should be examples of systems
<br />
which have high information context, i.e. allow large but finite
<br />
tokenization.
<br />
17.  In the &quot;crystal&quot; case the token dictionary is small, but the
<br />
description in the &quot;tokens&quot; is large. In the &quot;gas&quot; case the token dictionary
<br />
is large but each token is used in the system only once.
<br />
18. We may speculate that if the token is used only once then this token is
<br />
not a true token. In fact, in human language words always refer to classes,
<br />
i.e. describe more than one object. The token is, in fact, a classification
<br />
factor.
<br />
19. A few stable D-interactions represent tokens of the system. Hence, they
<br />
convey information. Unstable D-interactions (the description of which is
<br />
divergingly complex, e.g. strange attractors), or divergingly large number
<br />
of thereof, produce divergent tokenization, and comprise T-interactions.
<br />
20. A shape is a token too, hence the linguistic discourse.....
<br />
<p><p>Thanks for the labour of reading this rather eclectic passage. Hope some of
<br />
the thoughts presented here migh trigger discussion.
<br />
<p><p>Yours, Igor
