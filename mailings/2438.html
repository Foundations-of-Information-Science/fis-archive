                    <br />
                    Andrei Khrennikov &amp; Jonathan D.H. Smith
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>1. QUANTUM INFORMATION ---MYTHS AND REALITY
                    <br />
                    (Andrei Khrennikov)
                    <br />
                <p>Quantum information is science about processing of information by exploring
                    <br />
                    some distinguishing features of quantum systems, e.g., electrons, photons,
                    <br />
                    ions. Last years gurus of quantum information promised a lot, may be even
                    <br />
                    too much. In quantum computing it was promised that NP-problems would be
                    <br />
                    solved in polynomial time. In quantum cryptography there were claims that
                    <br />
                    protocols would have 100% security. This gave the possibility to sell
                    <br />
                    quantum mechanics the second time � in new century and with new sauce. Huge
                    <br />
                    grants were distributed in USA, EU and Japan. At the moment it is too early
                    <br />
                    to say anything definite about the final output of this great project.
                    <br />
                <p>In quantum computing there were created a few quantum algorithms and
                    <br />
                    developed devices, �quantum pre-computers�, with a few quantum registers.
                    <br />
                    However, difficulties could not be more ignored. By some reason it was
                    <br />
                    impossible to create numerous quantum algorithms which could be applied to
                    <br />
                    various problems. Up to now the whole project is based on 2-3 algorithms
                    <br />
                    and among them the only one, namely, the algorithms for finding prime
                    <br />
                    factors, can be interesting for real applications. There is a general
                    <br />
                    tendency to consider this situation with quantum algorithms as an
                    <br />
                    occasional difficulty. But as years pass, one might start to think that
                    <br />
                    there is something fundamentally wrong. The same feelings are induced by
                    <br />
                    development of quantum hardware. It seems that the complexity of the
                    <br />
                    problem of creation of a device with a large number N of quantum registers
                    <br />
                    increases extremely nonlinearly with increasing N.
                    <br />
                <p>In quantum cryptography the situation is in some sense opposite to quantum
                    <br />
                    computing. There were tremendous successes in development of technologies
                    <br />
                    for production and transmission of quantum information, especially pairs of
                    <br />
                    entangled photons. We emphasize that at the moment photons give the most
                    <br />
                    real basis of quantum cryptography. It is doubtful that there would be
                    <br />
                    created systems for quantum cryptography which would be based on e.g.
                    <br />
                    electrons. It is not easy to imagine refrigerators with electrons which are
                    <br />
                    used for transportation of quantum information. On the other hand, the
                    <br />
                    claim on 100% security of quantum protocols is far from to be totally
                    <br />
                    justified.
                    <br />
                <p>Any careful analysis of this situation implies immediately that the whole
                    <br />
                    project �Quantum Information� should be based on more solid foundations.
                    <br />
                    We recall that quantum mechanics by itself is a huge building having the
                    <br />
                    sand-fundament �the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. On one hand, there
                    <br />
                    was created the advanced mathematical formalism (calculus of probabilities
                    <br />
                    in the complex Hilbert space) giving predictions which are supported by all
                    <br />
                    existing experimental data. On the other hand, it is still unclear why this
                    <br />
                    formalism works so well and moreover it is not clear what it really
                    <br />
                    predicts, because by the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation (which is the
                    <br />
                    conventional interpretation) quantum mechanics is not about physical
                    <br />
                    reality by itself, but about just our observations (of what?). All unsolved
                    <br />
                    problems of quantum foundations are essentially amplified in the quantum
                    <br />
                    information project. Problems which were of a purely philosophic interest
                    <br />
                    during one hundred years became technological and business problems.
                    <br />
                <p>Therefore �Quantum Information� gives a new great chance for
                    <br />
                    reconsideration of quantum foundations, see, e.g., electronic proceedings
                    <br />
                    of conferences at:
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    . Whether such a chance will be used depends on many scientific,
                    <br />
                    psychological and market factors. Unfortunately, at the time being there is
                    <br />
                    the tendency to ignore fundamental difficulties and reduce everything to
                    <br />
                    technological problems. Of course, development of quantum technologies, in
                    <br />
                    particular manipulation with individual quantum systems, is the extremely
                    <br />
                    interesting project. But I hope that it could be done essentially more if
                    <br />
                    quantum computing and cryptography would be also considered as new tools
                    <br />
                    for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics.
                    <br />
                <p>First of all we should come back to the greatest debate of 20th century,
                    <br />
                    namely debate between Einstein and Bohr on completeness of quantum
                    <br />
                    mechanics. It is commonly accepted that quantum mechanics is complete: the
                    <br />
                    psi-function provides the most complete description of the state of quantum
                    <br />
                    system. It is impossible to find a more detailed description of quantum
                    <br />
                    reality � to find a model with hidden variables. This is the basis of the
                    <br />
                    orthodox Copenhagen interpretation and nowadays this is the basis of
                    <br />
                    quantum cryptography. If one were able to find a model with hidden
                    <br />
                    variables which reproduce quantum statistics, then the total security of
                    <br />
                    quantum protocols would be questioned! In probabilistic terms this is the
                    <br />
                    problem of so called irreducible quantum randomness. In the opposition to
                    <br />
                    classical randomness, it is claimed (since von Neumann) that quantum
                    <br />
                    randomness could not be reduced to the conventional ensemble randomness.
                    <br />
                <p>Thus I would like to propose to discuss �Quantum Foundations in Light of
                    <br />
                    Quantum Information� or �Quantum Information in Light of Quantum
                    <br />
                    Foundations.� One of the possibilities is to start with Bell�s inequality,
                    <br />
                    since its violations play the fundamental role in foundations of quantum
                    <br />
                    information. One of the possible starting points might be
                    <br />

                <p>2. QUANTUM INFORMATION: BASICS AND OPEN QUESTIONS
                    <br />
                    (Jonathan D H Smith)
                    <br />
                <p>To approach quantum information theory, it is best to contrast it with
                    <br />
                    classical information theory. Laying aside philosophical connotations that
                    <br />
                    often cause confusion, it will help to focus on the basic formulation for
                    <br />
                    some elementary and quite concrete examples. These examples may serve as
                    <br />
                    'reality checks' during the course of our discussion. In mathematical
                    <br />
                    terms, classical information theory just works with sets, or probability
                    <br />
                    distributions on those sets, while quantum information theory works with
                    <br />
                    linear algebra or matrices over the complex numbers.

                <p>+ CLASSICAL BITS
                    <br />
                <p>A classical bit is a set with two elements A and B, say 0 and 1 as binary
                    <br />
                    digits. (The term 'bit' is a contraction of 'binary digit,' although also
                    <br />
                    having the layman's sense of 'a small piece,' since one may build larger
                    <br />
                    stores of information by using lots of bits.) Concretely, A and B may
                    <br />
                    represent: a coin showing heads or tails, a switch being open or closed, a
                    <br />
                    magnetization of north or south, a spin oriented up or down, an abacus
                    <br />
                    pebble at the top or bottom of the frame, and so on.
                    <br />
                <p>Instead of a set with two elements, we may consider a probability
                    <br />
                    distribution on that set. This just means two non-negative numbers, PA
                    <br />
                    attached to the element A, and PB attached to the element B, such that PA
                    <br />
                    and PB add up to unity or 1. For example, if the coin is being flipped onto
                    <br />
                    a table, it may have probability PA of landing heads, and PB of landing
                    <br />
                    tails. (PA and PB add up to unity, since we assume the coin lands flat on
                    <br />
                    the table, and doesn't roll off under the refrigerator where we can't see it.)
                    <br />
                <p>To get back from probability distributions to elements, we may consider the
                    <br />
                    element A as the probability distribution with PA = 1 and PB = 0 , while
                    <br />
                    B corresponds to PA = 0 and PB = 1 . So the classical bit has become the
                    <br />
                    set of all the probability distributions (PA,PB), identifying the element A
                    <br />
                    with the distribution (1,0), and the element B with the distribution (0,1).
                    <br />
                <p>We may call (1,0) the 'pure state A', and (0,1) the 'pure state B.' While
                    <br />
                    the (fair) coin is flipping through the air, it is in the 'mixed state'
                    <br />
                    (1/2,1/2). When it lands on the table, the force of the impact bumps it
                    <br />
                    from the mixed state into one of the pure states.
                    <br />
                <p>One may also consider the pairs (PA,PB) as Cartesian coordinates of points
                    <br />
                    in the plane. Geometrically, the classical bit is then the straight line
                    <br />
                    segment connecting the two pure states (1,0) and (0,1).
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>+ QUANTUM BITS
                    <br />
                <p>The quantum information theory analog of the classical bit is the qbit
                    <br />
                    (pronounced like the biblical 'cubit'), short for 'quantum bit' (or maybe
                    <br />
                    'quantum binary digit'). A qbit is a 2x2 matrix QSTATE or
                    <br />
                <p>[ QAA QAB ]
                    <br />
                    [ QBA QBB ]
                    <br />
                <p>in which the entries Qxy are complex numbers, QAA and QBB are
                    <br />
                    non-negative real numbers adding up to 1, and the complex conjugate of QAB
                    <br />
                    is QBA.
                    <br />
                <p>Just as a classical bit is implemented physically by a flipping coin, a
                    <br />
                    qbit is implemented physically by a spinning electron (stationary at a
                    <br />
                    known location).
                    <br />
                <p>Explicitly, consider the Pauli matrices
                    <br />
                <p>[ 0 1 ]
                    <br />
                    [ 1 0 ]
                    <br />
                <p>or SX,
                    <br />
                <p>[ 0 -i ]
                    <br />
                    [ i 0 ]
                    <br />
                <p>or SY, and
                    <br />
                <p>[ 1 0 ]
                    <br />
                    [ 0 -1 ]
                    <br />
                <p>or SZ.
                    <br />
                <p>Then for Planck's constant HBAR which is about 10 to the -35 th power
                    <br />
                    joule-seconds, the spin of the electron in the direction of the X-axis is
                    <br />
                    HBAR/2 times the trace of the product of SX with QSTATE. (The trace of a
                    <br />
                    square matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements.) The spin in the
                    <br />
                    Y-direction is obtained similarly using SY, and the spin in the Z-direction
                    <br />
                    is obtained similarly using SZ. Just as the flipping coin can be observed
                    <br />
                    (heads or tails) once it has landed on the table, you get to measure the
                    <br />
                    spin of the electron in just one direction.
                    <br />
                <p>A qbit certainly contains at least a classical bit of information. If
                    <br />
                    QSTATE has QAA = 1 and all other entries zero, then you get a positive spin
                    <br />
                    in the Z-direction. If QSTATE has QBB = 1 and all other entries zero, then
                    <br />
                    you get a negative spin in the Z-direction.
                    <br />
                <p>In experiments on quantum computation, engineers can apparently now prepare
                    <br />
                    several electrons with prescribed spins. But a qbit is much more than a
                    <br />
                    classical bit. While you only have one degree of freedom moving back and
                    <br />
                    forth along the line segment (PA,PB) of the classical bit, there are three
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom in the qbit QSTATE. The pair (QAA,QBB) is like the
                    <br />
                    classical bit, but QAB can be anywhere in the complex plane.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>+ IS QUANTUM (INFORMATION) THEORY REALLY NECESSARY?
                    <br />
                <p>This question is an obvious topic for discussion in our forum. If you think
                    <br />
                    the answer is negative,
                    <br />
                    that maybe everything can be done using clever tricks with classical
                    <br />
                    probabilities, then a test case would be to describe the spinning electron.
                    <br />
                    Is your description as elegant and satisfactory
                    <br />
                    as the quantum description?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>+ ENTANGLEMENT
                    <br />
                <p>To handle more information, you can build a store with several classical
                    <br />
                    bits. The (pure) state set for this store is the Cartesian or direct
                    <br />
                    product of many two-element sets, one for each individual classical bit.
                    <br />
                <p>If you have several qbits QSTATE1, ... , QSTATEn, then the state of the
                    <br />
                    complete store is given
                    <br />
                    as the tensor or Kronecker product of these matrices. For example, the
                    <br />
                    Kronecker product of
                    <br />
                    QSTATE1 with QSTATE2 is
                    <br />
                <p>[ QAA1*QSTATE2 QAB1*QSTATE2 ]
                    <br />
                    [ QBA1*QSTATE2 QBB1*QSTATE2 ]
                    <br />
                <p>as a matrix of four 2x2 blocks. If you measure the first qbit here, your
                    <br />
                    choices for the measurement of the second or any further qbits are limited.
                    <br />
                    These later qbits have become 'entangled' with the first.
                    <br />
                <p>By contrast, knowing the first classical bit in your classical store puts
                    <br />
                    no limitations on the possibilities for the subsequent classical bits.
                    <br />
                    However, knowledge of the first marginal in a classical multivariate
                    <br />
                    probability distribution may limit the possibilities for the subsequent
                    <br />
                    marginals.
                    <br />
                <p>Is this classical effect enough to account for quantum entanglement?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>+ QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
                    <br />
                <p>Take a two-part quantum system, and separate its parts, giving one to Alice
                    <br />
                    in Algeria
                    <br />
                    and the other to Bob in Botswana. Under certain circumstances, entanglement
                    <br />
                    may imply that a measurement made by Bob immediately tells him what Alice
                    <br />
                    is experiencing.
                    <br />
                <p>Can this be a communication protocol?
                    <br />
                <p>If so, what are its features and limitations?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>+ QUANTUM COMPUTATION
                    <br />
                <p>Since a qbit can potentially store more than a single classical bit, people
                    <br />
                    nowadays view processing qbits as a highly parallel version of digital
                    <br />
                    processing. Before digital computers, there were analog computers. (For
                    <br />
                    example, integrating tables.) How does quantum computation compare with
                    <br />
                    analog computation? Is it just a special case (using spinning electrons
                    <br />
                    instead of friction wheels and slides)?
                    <br />
                <p>Turing machines provide a good formal model for classical digital
                    <br />
                    computers. Is there an equally good formal model for quantum computation?
                    <br />
                <p>Can the output from a physically feasible quantum computer ever be more
                    <br />
                    than a single classical bit --a single yes or no answer?
                    <br />
                <p>More generally: What exactly is computable with quantum computation? (For
                    <br />
                    comparison, Church's Thesis says that Turing machines compute recursive
                    <br />
                    functions.)
                    <br />
                <p>Sometimes it is claimed that the human brain displays certain aspects of
                    <br />
                    quantum computation. Is this analogy helpful? How far does it go?
                    <br />
