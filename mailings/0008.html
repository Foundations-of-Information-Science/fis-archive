Author's Response to Comments made by Pedro Marijuan about
<br />
INFORMATION AND MEANING  (Springer 1997):
<br />
<p>Here is what Pedro said :
<br />
&quot;About Tom압 last book, Information and Meaning, Springer 1997,
<br />
one can hardly disagree with the overall attempt: setting a conceptual
<br />
system bridging the gap in between our physical (chemical, biological,
<br />
etc.) knowledge and our own social environment. Information is the central
<br />
arch, but intelligence, meaning, consciousness, language, feedbacks,
<br />
resonance, etc. also play important roles (unfortunately, not always very
<br />
clearly established).&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;About the starting point on information and energy, I would suggest going
<br />
to the Madrid 1994 Proceedings (BioSystems, 38, p. 151) where Welch
<br />
refers to the thermodynamic costs of molecular computing-- the dissipated
<br />
energy for one bit as equals to K.T . Perhaps I am wrong, but this seems
<br />
the
<br />
same value than Tom압 for the relationship between entropy and information.
<br />
So, there might be no great thermodynamic novelties there (without denying
<br />
that Tom압 re-estatement is more suggestive and thought provoking).&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;The new aspects of the book include fascinating comments about social
<br />
knowledge (eg, medieval Europe and China), origins of human language (info
<br />
proc. role of vowels and consonants in primates), and some hints about
<br />
consciousness putting together Edelman압 reentrant circuits with the
<br />
&quot;semantic metabolism&quot; analogy. Personally I find the metabolic analogy very
<br />
rich --well, maybe because myself am independently devoting some thought
<br />
to it in the BioSystems FIS sp. issue to appear. The tecno-utopian
<br />
excursions
<br />
look far less interesting. Perhaps they are addressed to non-scientific
<br />
public.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;Far more considerations should have been introduced, particularly about
<br />
consciousness: time, molecular dimension, cellular internal architectures,
<br />
evolution &amp; brain organization, topology, etc. (sure that our coming
<br />
conference will show that!). Besides, very few references, if any, are made
<br />
to neuroscience models, schemes, theories, etc., that could be plausible
<br />
from the point of view of rigorous scientific reasoning (even Edelman is
<br />
only indirectly cited--he does not appear in the References list).
<br />
Frequently one can find trouble in the way Tom builds his thought based on
<br />
analogical reasoning. In this, it ressembles the way popular books are
<br />
written. That mixing of audiences may be a two edge sword. It can be very
<br />
dangerous for the sci. level of the book, but conversely it might bring a
<br />
large educated public to become interested in the info sci. topics.&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;In my opinion, Tom압 views become a rather premature synthetic attempt.
<br />
But let us wait and see! I will be very glad to &quot;eat&quot; these critical
<br />
comments
<br />
(fortunately they have virtual suport).&quot;
<br />
=========================  Author's response to follow  ==&gt;
<br />
<p>Pedro and I have had an on-going discussion about the above book.  Some
<br />
of the points raised earlier might be of interest to the FIS community --
<br />
something to put out on the net in the future.  At the moment, I confine
<br />
myself to the above comments made in Pedro's communication of   
<br />
Wed.  3 Dec.  1997.
<br />
<p>I begin with the confession that I suffered from &quot;information overload&quot;. 
<br />
As
<br />
I indicated in the &quot;Apologia&quot; at the beginning of the book, the book took
<br />
well over five years to write (not full-time) and many relevant references
<br />
ended up being omitted.  In addition, the broad scope of the book,
<br />
precluded my being on top of all the literature.  My ignorance covers large
<br />
areas of well established knowledge.
<br />
<p>Having said that, at this point in time, it may be well to recall Erwin
<br />
Schroedinger' admonition:  &quot;A scientist is supposed to have a complete and
<br />
thorough knowledge, at first hand, of some subjects, and, therefore, is
<br />
usually expected not to write on any topic of which he is not a master.&quot; 
<br />
Schr漆inger, however, argues that:  &quot;... The spread, both in width and
<br />
depth of the multifarious branches of knowledge ... has confronted us with
<br />
a queer dilemma.  We ... are only now beginning to acquire reliable
<br />
material
<br />
for welding together the sum-total of all that is known into a whole; but,
<br />
on
<br />
the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to
<br />
command more than a small specialized portion of it.&quot;  He concludes:  &quot;I
<br />
can see no escape from this dilemma ... than that some of us should venture
<br />
to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories ... at the risk of making
<br />
fools
<br />
of ourselves.&quot; 
<br />
<p>This apologia is to put into perspective the dearth of neuroscience models,
<br />
schemes, theories, etc.  I chose from my reading those models whose
<br />
cogency appeals to me.  There is an awful lot of nonsense out there,
<br />
although the field is moving at enormous speed.  I should think that before
<br />
another decade has passed, we will have a very good understanding of how
<br />
the brain works.  In the meantime, INFORMATION AND MEANING will
<br />
have elucidated how a physical, organic entity, the brain, is able to
<br />
create
<br />
this ephemeral entity, called: the mind.  The book also proposes a theory
<br />
about the underlying mechanism by which neural networks store and
<br />
manipulate semantic items.  
<br />
<p>Needless to say, I would be thankful for any suggestions from colleagues of
<br />
significant work of which I should be aware.  I am, after all, somewhat
<br />
isolated in the wilds of Western Massachusetts.
<br />
<p>It is not surprising, in view of his own significant contributions to the
<br />
field,
<br />
that Pedro is happy with my effort to shift the model which describes the
<br />
functions of the brain from one of  &quot;information processing&quot;  to  &quot;semantic
<br />
metabolism&quot; -- a paradigm shift which analogizes the action of the brain,
<br />
not so much to what a computer does, but to how a cell metabolizes
<br />
incoming molecules.  
<br />
<p>The &quot;techno-utopian excursions&quot; are not really a part of  INFORMATION
<br />
AND MEANING, or at least, only peripherally so.  This matter will be
<br />
explored in a future work entitled &quot;From Ape to Essence&quot; (if this broad,
<br />
interdisciplinary manuscript can ever find a publisher).  
<br />
<p>Analogous reasoning should not be an object of criticism.  Not only is
<br />
analogous reasoning a powerful intellectual tool -- many profound insights
<br />
owe their existence as a result of taking a phenomenon or experience in one
<br />
field of knowledge, and applying it to another -- but it is also an
<br />
extremely
<br />
valuable pedantic tool.  Polya's dictum, that when teaching a child, you
<br />
should always begin with an example which is already known and
<br />
understood by the child, applies equally to readers unfamiliar with the
<br />
subject under discussion.  
<br />
<p>For example, I make no apologies for using the ticker-tape sign on Times
<br />
Square (New York) as a device whose moving letters create an information
<br />
&quot;reality&quot; for its viewers, or that certain aspects of brain processes
<br />
behave in
<br />
a manner analogous to a symphony orchestra.  True, such common-day 
<br />
examples may degrade the academic discourse somewhat but is it a sin to
<br />
try to reach out to a wider audience than those of the FIS community?  
<br />
<p>I am puzzled by the remarks on &quot;the starting points on information and
<br />
energy&quot;.  The equation that  1J/oK = 10*23 bits (approximately) was
<br />
arrived at independently in the late 1980s and published in
<br />
INFORMATION AND THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE
<br />
UNIVERSE  (Springer 1990  pg. 51).  Pedro's comments made me go back
<br />
to Rickey Welch's paper -- which promptly made me blush because it was a
<br />
paper which I had meant to include in the chapter on &quot;Semantic
<br />
Metabolism&quot; but missed -- my apologies to him.   However, the equation 
<br />
E 8 kT ln(2), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T, the absolute
<br />
temperature, does not convey a relationship between information (as bits)
<br />
and energy (as Joules per degree) anywhere near as clearly and
<br />
unequivocally as does ~10*23 bits = 1J/K.  
<br />
<p>Obviously, I would welcome further comments and discussion on these, or
<br />
any other points, concerning information, intelligence, and meaning.  
<br />
Tom
