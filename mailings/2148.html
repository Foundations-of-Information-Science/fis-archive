                <p>
                    Dear Hans and colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>I quite agree with the suggestion. Actually it dovetails with previous
                    <br />
                    comments by Michel's, Soeren's and other parties. Maybe this advocacy on
                    <br />
                    dedicated teamworkship is a sign of maturity in our common enterprise...
                    <br />
                <p>In practical matters, let me suggest that you three (and a few others)
                    <br />
                    could have some private exchanges on how to organize the task, at least
                    <br />
                    during some initial steps. Also, given that during the Paris conference
                    <br />
                    there were informal conversations among some parties on launching a
                    <br />
                    &quot;natural computer science&quot; team (and some other party was trying to promote
                    <br />
                    a &quot;sustainable development&quot; team too), there seems to be the need to create
                    <br />
                    a new platform, sort of a web log, to collectively lodge these potential
                    <br />
                    projects. In a few weeks, the institute I am currently working in (I3A),
                    <br />
                    will offer us one log platform for housing these tentative teams (at no
                    <br />
                    cost). So, the present discussion list and the existing web pages, could
                    <br />
                    have a nice and scholarly complement.
                    <br />
                <p>Starting dedicated teamworkship, in whatever areas, may bring substantial
                    <br />
                    advantages, if properly organized. Recently I have read about the need of
                    <br />
                    three kinds of scientists: explorers, organizers, and administrators
                    <br />
                    (institutionalists). Definitely, our band of &quot;lonely explorers&quot; has now
                    <br />
                    crossed some threshold and needs some starting into those organization and
                    <br />
                    institutionalization dimensions.
                    <br />
                <p>all the best
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro
