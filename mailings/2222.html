FIS Friends --
<br />
<p>I am sorry that I have not been available to participate in the 
<br />
discussion on definitions. Other projects beckon, but with the 
<br />
promise of helping with the larger issues of FIS.
<br />
<p>However, instead of having participated in the &quot;definitions&quot; thread, 
<br />
let me reiterate what I said in Paris in the two meetings. I have the 
<br />
rather strong impression that there is no definition of information 
<br />
that will be the &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; that was implied in most of the 
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<p>When you are dealing with a concept this primitive and expressions so 
<br />
broad, you find that the diversity is there for good reasons. The 
<br />
diverse notions come from irreconcilable ontologies (a proposition 
<br />
that seems provable with current theoretical tools, by the way).
<br />
<p>What should happen in cases like this, is that you set the formal 
<br />
ontology from which that definition will be derived by understanding 
<br />
the context first. Utility of definitions always comes from crispness 
<br />
of purpose.
<br />
<p>So the question is: why do we want a definition? I believe the answer 
<br />
will trifurcate based on the three interest groups in FIS. One group 
<br />
believes the purpose of FIS is to host scholarly dialog. Most members 
<br />
of this group have pet theories the dialog helps refine, or at least 
<br />
it identifies the weaker arguments. Those in this club seek 
<br />
definitions simply because it makes the discussion easier. Or rather 
<br />
it makes it possible in the first place.
<br />
<p>A second group believes that information is such a pervasive notion 
<br />
and its mechanics are so bound up in everything that it deserves a 
<br />
sort of superdiscipline or pandiscipline. These folks have it harder 
<br />
because they seek the one true definition. Good luck, I say.
<br />
<p>I'm in a third group, which seems to wax and wane depending on what 
<br />
promising concepts parade across the stage. I believe that we need 
<br />
something more than a rebundling and synthesis of what we have. I 
<br />
think we need a (new) science of information and that at least some 
<br />
elements of it will display new abstractions and mechanisms that 
<br />
aren't familiar, aren't accidents of history.
<br />
<p>This is by far the more difficult challenge and one I would like to 
<br />
see it more prominently in the FIS agenda. The first question to be 
<br />
asked is: What is the problem we have with the way things are now? 
<br />
What problem will go away if we have such a new science?
<br />
<p>If we know that, we know a lot, including what shape a successful 
<br />
definition of information will have. (I will politely suggest the 
<br />
other groups need to ask a similar question about situation; it is 
<br />
the only way to address basic ontological mismatches.)
<br />
<p>In Paris, I presented such a problem, together with some tentative 
<br />
mechanics and such. I will be rewriting that presentation as a sort 
<br />
of manifesto for this agenda, call it the FIS(3) agenda if you wish. 
<br />
I believe if we are to really have an impact, key statements on this 
<br />
matter (definitions of the problem and information, solutions) need 
<br />
to be packagable so that a non-specialist can understand it. You can 
<br />
read such a popular report of the FIS meeting here:
<br />
<p>&lt;<a href="../../www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/goranson1">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/goranson1</a>&gt;
<br />
<p>I think the readership of that is a few million, probably more.
<br />
<p>I will not use this message (already long) to outline a manifesto. I 
<br />
am still struggling myself on how ambitious the agenda would be. I am 
<br />
negotiating with some possible collaborators in this scoping. I have 
<br />
promised Wolfgang to submit it, perhaps in parts, to his online 
<br />
neoFIS journal.
<br />
<p>I see three main problems that the new science would help to resolve. 
<br />
The first is the one I presented in Paris: the vertical flow through 
<br />
abstraction layers of complex systems. I know something about this 
<br />
problem.
<br />
<p>We cannot escape the second problem, which is that pesky matter of 
<br />
entropy and encoding. We have to live with mechanisms that work, but 
<br />
it must be obvious that there is no satisfactory &quot;stretch&quot; of the 
<br />
thermodynamic notion. Some stretches DO work (forgive the pun), but 
<br />
in limited domains and with inelegant associations. A new science 
<br />
would introduce the simple elegance we all suspect must be there. I 
<br />
myself see a continuity between Einstein's revolution in situating 
<br />
physical notions, Freud's in situating social ones (though his 
<br />
mechanics are weak) and what we must do in the general domain whose 
<br />
&quot;situation&quot; spans physics through societal concepts and fashions.
<br />
<p>And there may be a third problem in the scope. I believe it 
<br />
inevitable that we revisit logic. Many have concluded this as well. 
<br />
(I've mentioned Barwise before.) Alternative logics already exist in 
<br />
fields that presently seem remote from science - in fact this is the 
<br />
point, they seem remote from science precisely because their logics 
<br />
are so different. I suggest we consider artistic and humanity-centric 
<br />
&quot;logics&quot; also, as we hunt for tools, and be open to a scope that 
<br />
includes internal conceptual mechanics: desires, intuitions, 
<br />
emotions, creativity.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
