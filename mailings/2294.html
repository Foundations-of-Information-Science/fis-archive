                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear John and colleagues:
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;The issue is, in my opinion: under which conditions is the emerging system
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;able to develop an additional degree of freedom? If this is the case, the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;situation cannot be contained in the phase space ex ante.
                    </em><br />
                <p>We may ask, what is entailed by the addition of a degree of freedom? In my
                    <br />
                    just previous posting (pasted in below) I noted that the addition of
                    <br />
                    biological constraints to a chemical system, or the addition of social
                    <br />
                    contraints to a biological system, each time limits further the freedom
                    <br />
                    with which involved molecules can take up positions in spacetime with
                    <br />
                    respect to each other, by initiating strong correlations between them. As
                    <br />
                    well, increasing amounts of entropy production would be taken over by
                    <br />
                    activities involving supramolecular configurations. From the point of view
                    <br />
                    of the involved molecules, the impostion of biology and sociality amount to
                    <br />
                    increasing degrees of UNfreedom. In fact, the degrees of freedom that are
                    <br />
                    instituted by biological and social informational constraints would not
                    <br />
                    have existed, as such, in a purely physical-chemical system, and so the
                    <br />
                    molecules would have been freer to move around as individuals. I think it
                    <br />
                    is not always clearly seen that the emergence of new realms in nature
                    <br />
                    (e.g., biology, sociality) involves the imposition of MORE constraints upon
                    <br />
                    a phsical-chemical system). Failure to see this, I think, happens because
                    <br />
                    these emergences are often viewed as ways that the world comes to transcend
                    <br />
                    its previous limitations. I think this perspective is misleading. What
                    <br />
                    substance this viewpoint has can be appreciated when -- after instituting
                    <br />
                    new degrees of freedom -- it happens that they do NOT get fixed, but remain
                    <br />
                    as part of informational entropy instead. Now the emergent system seems
                    <br />
                    to have acquired, indeed, more degrees of freedom to play with, even though
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom have been lost at the lower levels. This is to say that
                    <br />
                    degrees of freedom appear as openings and opportunities only when they are
                    <br />
                    NOT fixed. To the extent that a system acquires more and more degrees of
                    <br />
                    freedom AND they also get fixed, that system gets inceasingly nailed down
                    <br />
                    by information (this information 'overload' is the basis of a strong theory
                    <br />
                    of senescence). Thus, a biological system, say, or social system, is
                    <br />
                    interesting only to the extent that its various possibilities remain
                    <br />
                    uncertain. From the point of view of molecules at lower than biological /
                    <br />
                    social levels, degrees of freedom opened by the emergence of these higher
                    <br />
                    integrative levels impose barriers to their freedom to move whether they
                    <br />
                    are fixed or not. These new degrees of freedom can create openings and
                    <br />
                    possibilities ONLY at the higher levels, after closing down possibilities
                    <br />
                    at the lower levels. With emergence, some of the possibilities of
                    <br />
                    activity by a system will have moved upscale from the molecular level.

                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my original complaint I was objecting
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the idea that sociality alone is sufficient to produce new
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;information (or new information capacity). The issue is similar to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that of whether or not neural nets can produce anything new
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;(substitute social nets to get the argument for the social case
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;mutatis mutandis). Jerry Fodor argues that they cannot, since space
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of possibilities is not increased by anything that happens in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;net.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this might not be quite correct. If there come to
                    be
                    <br />
                    habitual connections between certain nodes, like feedbacks in emergent
                    <br />
                    'autocatalytic' loops, the rates of reaction of such regions will become
                    <br />
                    slower than the average for the network, and if that rate is significantly
                    <br />
                    different, even a new level of scale might emerge. In the 'unevolved'
                    <br />
                    network it might be that the rates of communication between nodes would be
                    <br />
                    power law distributed, but if different rates are not allocated to certain
                    <br />
                    regions (as would be the case that I just described) but could emerge
                    <br />
                    anywhere in the network, then there would have been no emergence of a new
                    <br />
                    level.
