course, just as likely that any variation in the environment will trigger

similarly nonlinear reactions by the society, since the environment itself

has been driven far from equilibrium.  Either situation leads directly to

circumstances in which the dynamic stability of society and environment

reaches a crisis or bifurcation point.&lt;
<br />
<p>[Gottfried]
<br />
I agree that rites are too &quot;heavy&quot; to support fast change in a for from
<br />
equilibrium state. They are part of the non-equilibrium, they are boosting!
<br />
(As we
<br />
can see nowadays). So, what to do with them in a situation where the
<br />
likelyhood of instability and nonlinear reactions is increasing enourmosly?
<br />
We know that social information processes are irreversible, we can not go
<br />
back to the &quot;good old times&quot;, where there has still been &quot;morality&quot; and
<br />
respect of tradtional rites and behaviours.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So for social systems to endure they must be able to adapt quickly to
</em><br />
changing circumstances.  However, adaptation means they will have to reduce
<br />
uncertainty about parts of the world never before experienced.  Storing new
<br />
information may lead to the invention of new media, some of which may be
<br />
more effective than rites, rituals and force.  Technologies and arts, for
<br />
instance, store information*and it may be that the earliest arts are
<br />
descriptions of how to locate and exploit resources upon which the
<br />
collective depends.  &lt;
<br />
<p>You got the point: rituals, force etc. do not do their &quot;job&quot; any more. They
<br />
are now unable to reduce uncertainty. Or, still &quot;worse&quot;, they increase
<br />
uncertainty as they themselfes are not certain  any more. So we have to
<br />
look, as you say, for new media. That can only be, IMO, a media made out of
<br />
a non-rites and non-force kind. A media that (like art and tecnology, as
<br />
you mention) helps social creativity to come out to wipe off the &quot;unfit&quot;
<br />
VEMs and roles of the past which have lead to war,
<br />
environtmental destruction and misery, globally.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In any case, the most effective ways to store and communicate social
</em><br />
information use language.  Legends and myths, for example, can tell stories
<br />
about ancestral actions and describe results in ways that will encourage
<br />
succeeding generations to mimic those behaviors in pursuit of expected
<br />
results.  You can tell stories faster than you can act out rituals, or
<br />
force slaves to embody actions. &lt;
<br />
<p>No, no, legends and myths are still part of rites and rituals, which, as
<br />
you already said, and I second, are not sufficiently fit to accompaign or
<br />
stabilize todays
<br />
dynamics of social change.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if language could map relationships, the capacity of a social system
</em><br />
to store and communicate information would be vastly increased. &lt;
<br />
<p>I think the term &quot;language&quot; is a little bit too &quot;narrow&quot;.
<br />
Language is still associated with story-telling and convincing somebody by
<br />
force of eloquency, isnt it?
<br />
I think you may agree because you say:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It would no longer be necessary to tell individuals exactly what they
</em><br />
should do, which would limit collective possibilities to a small number of
<br />
known options.  Individuals could determine their own actions, for they
<br />
would be able to see the relationships they are in and deduce the behaviors
<br />
appropriate to those relationships.  This distribution of decision making
<br />
authority, combined with the possibility that individuals could
<br />
spontaneously adjust their actions to those of others, would immensely
<br />
increase the flexibility of the social system*it could preserve its order
<br />
even as it moved from one environmentally adaptive state to another.&lt;
<br />
<p>So, instead of claiming language to substitute VEMs, roles, rites etc., why
<br />
dont we speak of &quot;communication&quot;, in a broader sense, exchange of
<br />
information. Doing so, we can move from an individual-centered sociological
<br />
paradigm (based on VEM-controlled personal behaviours) to a
<br />
communication-act centered one (based on informationally guided collective
<br />
behaviour, providing the necessary flexibility and other features you
<br />
related above.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When language maps meaning*when it symbolizes how actions affect systems*a
</em><br />
new medium for storing social information has emerged.&lt;
<br />
<p>When COMMUNICATION maps meaning.... would be more certain, IMO.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This new medium is the VEMs characteristic of a particular society.  There
</em><br />
must be some threshold of population size, density, and distribution beyond
<br />
which VEMs emerge, but I do not know what it is.  Suffice it to say the
<br />
emergence of VEMs marks the evolution of complex social systems.  This
<br />
makes logical sense because one definition of complex systems is that they
<br />
have models of themselves, which is what VEMs are in terms of social
<br />
information.&lt;
<br />
<p>You are returning to the past, still. If VEMs would have had or provided a
<br />
model of complex society itself, if they really would have stored the
<br />
information necessary for social change, we would not need to surch for new
<br />
media. The problem, yet, is that VEMs have just worked for small dominant
<br />
groups (&quot;high society&quot;) in order to control and repress mass-consciousness.
<br />
What we need now to explain in sociology is how collective consciouness can
<br />
work without beeing controled by overcome VEMs.
<br />
Look, new  media is not equal to new VEMs. Media is communication between
<br />
parts throug the whole (global culture, spirit of humanity, name it as you
<br />
like). VEMs, as you already stated, dont have the necessary flexibility.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All societies have the same goal of preserving organization in a far from
</em><br />
equilibrium environment.  Yet every society has different VEMs.  VEMs
<br />
differ from society to society because VEMs are the peculiar symbols which
<br />
are able to excite individuals to choose behaviors forming a non-average
<br />
set of possibilities.  &lt;
<br />
<p>IMO, there do not exist &quot;societies&quot; (plural), at the level of an
<br />
information (communication)-guided sociological theory. We live in one
<br />
world and communicate in a global cultural layout (as we do on this list,
<br />
dont we?). Even if we would stick to the explanation of different VEMs in
<br />
different world regions, what would we explain. Only the past, the wars,
<br />
the old repressing order. Lets historians do that better. There would be
<br />
almost no outcome for explaining how to dissolve traditional VEMs to start
<br />
a global communication on our way to information society (singular).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since the society is not REPRODUCING but is REPLICATING, the analogy
</em><br />
between VEMs and DNA looks proper.  DNA replicates an organism by mapping
<br />
the molecular activities and chemicals forming particular cells.
<br />
Analogously, VEMs map choices leading to behaviors replicating social
<br />
systems.&lt;
<br />
<p>I think, here  we have to hear what Morris posted about (we both have not
<br />
been very right yet):
<br />
[Morris, previous]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An important difference is that gene type fitness is correlated with
</em><br />
Darwinian natural selection pressures. But social fitness is not Darwinian,
<br />
instead it seems Lamarkian! One thing is slow, long term, a priori
<br />
evolution
<br />
and another is immediate, fast changing, experiential dynamics which are
<br />
shared
<br />
above and beyond genetic information. Importantly, Lamarkian dynamics also
<br />
leaves room for reversibility (which I think is an important element in
<br />
VEMS and has been mentioned by Stockinger and Ebeling).&lt;
<br />
<p>If we want to explain traditional social order, you are right: VEMs in
<br />
analogy to DNA.
<br />
But if we want to explain the radical changements ongoing in this former
<br />
traditional order, darwinian slow-change explanations do not fit any more.
<br />
If I remember well (maybe Morris can help us more), Lamarkian evolution
<br />
goes beyond DNA-driven genetics.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;People must be taught how to act to replicate a social system, and it is
</em><br />
their socially scripted behaviors that are the *stuff* of societies.&lt;
<br />
<p>People have been taught, and the result is now a society out of
<br />
equilibrium. You got it already in your above statements. So if &quot;scripted&quot;
<br />
(controlled) behaviour is the stuff of societies, than &quot;goodbye poor
<br />
world&quot;! Fortunaltely, it is not. Society is made of a more &quot;sensitive&quot;
<br />
stuff: information and its communication.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Like VEMs, social roles vary from society to society.  There is,
</em><br />
therefore, a population of societies, which will successfully replicate for
<br />
greater or lesser periods of time.  Those which replicate roles on the
<br />
basis of humanistic VEMs, I think, tend to adapt and survive better.  They
<br />
are more fit because their members have greater autonomy.&lt;
<br />
<p>All our civilization is based on humanistics: order, progesss, liberté,
<br />
egalité, fraternité, christion values and so on. All of these general
<br />
values have been used to control behaviour for particular use. There was no
<br />
&quot;greater autonomy&quot; because of this VEMs.
