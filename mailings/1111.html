<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>Let me continue with some comments on molecular recognition. Jim's posting 
<br />
on the effect of scrambling the letters in human recognition of words, and 
<br />
the possible parallel in the molecular world, looks quite direct in the 
<br />
case of DNA. Scrambling a promoter, for instance, leads to a diminished 
<br />
expression of the gene --or in the case of an active site, to dramatically 
<br />
lower kinetic rates in the functioning of the enzyme.
<br />
<p>However,  what I find fascinating is that the scrambling may also alter the 
<br />
transportation destiny of the enzyme or protein, or its recognition and 
<br />
anchoring into a functional complex, or its sensibility regarding some 
<br />
effector, or its resistance to degradation... This actually means the 
<br />
multi-stage, enlarged character of the biomolecular agent --its 
<br />
transmolecularity-- that usually passes unnoticed (we only look at some 
<br />
catalytic effect). In terms of the current bioinformatic discussion on 
<br />
'systems biology' we might say that
<br />
<p>genome
<br />
tanscriptome,
<br />
proteome,
<br />
metabolome,
<br />
<p>usually obtained by separate techniques and ad hoc specialists, are linked 
<br />
and intercrossed by labyrintic lines of 'process'. And there is no way to 
<br />
consider any biofunction but as a complex cluster with pretty arbitrary 
<br />
frontiers in most cases. Let us note that all nodes in the massive 
<br />
intercrossing of events in the previous 'omes' are characterized by some 
<br />
specific molecular recognition case. (en passant, I think that we are still 
<br />
missing two new 'omes': the 'signalome' and the 'degradome', but is is too 
<br />
long to be followed here.)
<br />
<p>So, I am tempted to argue that the evolutionary consequences of focusing 
<br />
the cellular functioning in mol. recog. terms may be rich and profound. I 
<br />
think it is one of the key phenomenons that is called to produce the 
<br />
theoretical breakthrough necessary to conceptualize properly the 
<br />
astonishing masses of new facts that biology is producing at enormous 
<br />
speed. And I also think that our classical information categories discussed 
<br />
in the list ---generative, structural, communicational-- will get their 
<br />
mutual dynamic relationships far clearly established if we think in terms 
<br />
of the above molecular recognition matrix of events. Actually, the transfer 
<br />
of the generative towards the structural in a continuous communication with 
<br />
the environment ('boundary conditions') continues to be the linchpin of all 
<br />
forms of life. In some theoretical realms, neat theories on 'generative 
<br />
processes' or 'communication theories' have been produced: What would 
<br />
happen in the generalized interplay of the above biomolecular background? 
<br />
In my opinion, the paradoxical 'evanescent permanence' of life is the result.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Fis-list novelties:  Around ten people from very heterogeneous 
<br />
backgrounds have joined the list in recent weeks. I apologize that there is 
<br />
not much info available on how this list is organized, or its discussion 
<br />
style. Parsimonious posting (moderate length, no more than two postings per 
<br />
week) and slow responses are encouraged. Also, here we prefer bounded 
<br />
discussions with moderators (currently we are running the post-vacational 
<br />
part of a session on 'molecular recognition and molecular codes', with 
<br />
Shu-Kun and Sergei as central invitees and myself as moderator). But 
<br />
discussion 'tangents' are always welcome in this list (well tangents, and 
<br />
not necessarily 'whole geometries'). The next focused discussion will run 
<br />
around the middle of next month, on &quot;Ecological Economics and Information&quot;, 
<br />
moderated by Jerry Chandler and Luis Serra. For the newcomers, some perusal 
<br />
at the fis home site <a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/default.htm">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/</a>  and 
<br />
at  <a href="../../fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/default.htm">http://fis.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/mailings/</a> are very recommended.
