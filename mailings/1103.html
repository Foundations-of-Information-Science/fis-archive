<p>
Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>Considering the problem of recognition, we face following challenges.  If we 
<br />
talk about molecular similarities etc. we assume absolute space in the 
<br />
Newtonian sense and come to key-lock paradigm.  If we assume resonance 
<br />
approach, we use more convenient basic philosophy, but we still unaware of 
<br />
underlying appearing phenomena.
<br />
<p>I would suggest that recognition process appears at the level of interacting 
<br />
potential fields. When in the classical experiment photon passes through two 
<br />
splits, it passes as a potential field and then actualises itself on the 
<br />
screen. This all shows that “particle” or “wave-particle” approach is not 
<br />
fully relevant. More relevant is an interpretation of a potential field and 
<br />
its actualisation.
<br />
<p>But I do not aim to develop this topic in detail in this letter. Some 
<br />
initial approach was given in my paper in BioSystems in 1993 (vol. 31, pp. 
<br />
65-73) and I tried to develop it in other papers. I would like to put 
<br />
question about the limits of thermodynamic approach. I would not consider 
<br />
the second law as a basic principle of the Universe. Really the second law 
<br />
appears when we estimate actualised world, and do not consider the process 
<br />
of actualisation. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is non an exclusion. Fluxes 
<br />
that it describes are not the fluxes of actualisation: they are the fluxes 
<br />
of actualised particles.
<br />
<p>In correspondence with the second law, the standard for describing a dynamic 
<br />
system is an isolated equilibrium system with maximum entropy, and the 
<br />
change in entropy is analysed in relation to that standard. But such a 
<br />
standard is not valid, particularly for the description of living systems. 
<br />
An equilibrium system per se cannot be observed according to the basic 
<br />
principles of observation/recognition: for observation (which is achieved by 
<br />
quantum measurement) we non-controllably disturb the system, resulting in 
<br />
its disequilibration. That is why Robert Rosen mentioned once that the 
<br />
notion of entropy is not valid for living systems.
<br />
<p>The correctness of the second law is often proved by using construction like 
<br />
Maxwell´s Demon. But the problem here (the construction which selects fast 
<br />
and slow particles and thus decreases entropy) is also considered wrongly. 
<br />
Demon should really use energy to recognize fast and slow particles, 
<br />
increasing the entropy of the system. But in order to separate the 
<br />
particles, the Demon must acknowledge what to do with them. Therefore, the 
<br />
problem of the Demon cannot be solved only in thermodynamic terms, and the 
<br />
interaction of pre-existing knowledge (potential information like the 
<br />
Aristotelian entelechy as a knowledge) with thermodynamic system must be 
<br />
analysed in order to solve it.
<br />
<p>The problem of second law seems to be non-trivial and mainly based on 
<br />
misunderstandings. The complexity of living systems cannot be simply derived 
<br />
from external non-equilibrium. Moreover, it is not possible to prove 
<br />
violations of the second law since we consider the actual world in our 
<br />
analysis. The decision made by the regulating system appears in the 
<br />
potential reality and then it brings itself to the actual world consisting 
<br />
of particles and molecules. Living systems are not simply formed by actual 
<br />
non-equilibrium. They actively search for external non-equilibrium milieu 
<br />
suitable for their existence according to their internal decisions 
<br />
(expressed as semiotic constraints).
<br />
<p>I would not dismiss basic principles of physics. They work in our models of 
<br />
the world and this determines their relative validity. But the basic 
<br />
principles of even best working theories are wrong. Absolute space-time of 
<br />
Newton is arbitrary. Einstein could overcome it, but the principle of 
<br />
absolute speed of light is also arbitrary and based only on convenience. 
<br />
Wave-particle dualism is arbitrary. But the principles of thermodynamics are 
<br />
most arbitrary: they work in actualised non-living world.  Understanding all 
<br />
this will allow to move forward, and eventual achievement of challenging 
<br />
goals of knowledge goes through all these arbitrary rules and models, which 
<br />
are still necessary for building scientific theories.
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
Andrei Igamberdiev
