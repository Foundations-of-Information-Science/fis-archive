                    Dear All
                    <br />
                <p>Here we are again on the more earthly problems. Bob's remarks brings to the
                    <br />
                    arena the statistical description of events in socioeconomic systems and the
                    <br />
                    question as what kind of dynamical system economies are.

                    Bob: One way of coalescing Stan's alternatives is that both involve
                    <br />
                    self-organising criticalities (&quot;avalanches&quot;.) The question then becomes,
                    <br />
                    can major SOC's be avoided?
                    <br />
                <p>SOC has been used as a metaphor or a model of biological and socioeconomic
                    <br />
                    dynamics. After tinkering with it for the past few years, I am akin to
                    <br />
                    believe that SOC might be a good model for ecosystems and evolution but not
                    <br />
                    so for socioeconomic systems. The main argument (details are available in a
                    <br />
                    paper, if someone wishes, I can e-mail it) is that human systems are
                    <br />
                    dominated by institutional design, which constraints self-organizing
                    <br />
                    processes, (e.g. economic activities), in a non-trivial way (the market
                    <br />
                    itself is an institution). The nature of institutional design is in
                    <br />
                    contradiction with the self-organizing principle which is at the root of
                    <br />
                    critical behavior. Also, the formation and behavior of autocatalytic
                    <br />
                    networks, which is endogenous does not fit well with formal characteristics
                    <br />
                    of SOC, which refers to &quot;externally driven&quot; systems. However, SOC as a
                    <br />
                    metaphor may be very useful for social sciences as it points at power-law
                    <br />
                    distribution of events, the existence of thresholds and therefore non-linear
                    <br />
                    response to perturbation, and the importance of local interaction (all these
                    <br />
                    were mostly ignored by mainstream economics and its formal models). After
                    <br />
                    some drifting, I am finally convinced that mechanical physical models in
                    <br />
                    general (SOC is one of them) are not good representations of socioeconomic
                    <br />
                    systems. The main point is that socially shared values and beliefs, and
                    <br />
                    their institutional representations are not susceptible to formalization
                    <br />
                    while, on the other hand, they play a major role in the overall evolution of
                    <br />
                    the system as well as in its medium term dynamics (which is perhaps the
                    <br />
                    focal point of research interest). Differing viewpoints on this issue are
                    <br />
                    most welcome!
                    <br />
                <p>Bob and myself pointed at power-laws as one of the hallmarks of (economic)
                    <br />
                    system organization. They (necessarily) arise from an interplay of
                    <br />
                    autocatalytic processes and a particular institutional framework which is on
                    <br />
                    one hand supportive of autocatalysis, and on the other it constraints and
                    <br />
                    buffers its dynamics. One of the major questions is, as Bob wrote, if major
                    <br />
                    &quot;avalanches&quot; can be avoided. The analysis of business cycles in the US
                    <br />
                    indicates, that in the second halve of the 20th century recessions might
                    <br />
                    have become milder, as a consequence of monetary and fiscal &quot;automatic
                    <br />
                    stabilizers&quot; and other institutions. Bob and myself argued in our
                    <br />
                    introduction that a substantial change in a dominant worldview is necessary
                    <br />
                    to reduce the intensity of autocatalytic process in the world economy. The
                    <br />
                    rationale behind this is simple, if we mange somehow reduce the intensity of
                    <br />
                    autocatalytic process we may at the same time reduce the environmental
                    <br />
                    impact and the magnitude of major negative events. In this process which may
                    <br />
                    be called adaptation, information processing is of extreme importance. We
                    <br />
                    have coherent information sets as worldviews and worldviews as information
                    <br />
                    processing systems. This forms a complex, self-referential system in terms
                    <br />
                    of Robert Rosen's definition of complexity (an observer sees a systems as
                    <br />
                    &quot;complex&quot; when he has more that one single description of it). We surely do
                    <br />
                    have different descriptions, e.g. business people, environmentalists, the
                    <br />
                    World Bank, indigenous populations, scientist (those who are concerned and
                    <br />
                    those who are not) etc..
                    <br />
                    If we agree that the dominant worldview (shaped as its by economic
                    <br />
                    rationality and preference for material consumption) is not an adequate
                    <br />
                    &quot;information processing system&quot; for dealing with informational feedback that
                    <br />
                    comes from natural environment, than an improvement or change of its design
                    <br />
                    have something to do with the size distribution of &quot;avalanches&quot;, or not ?
                    <br />
                <p>I am trying to shift our discussion away from entropy and more in the
                    <br />
                    direction of information forming, transformation and its diffusion in social
                    <br />
                    and economic networks - I hope that Bob will agree with this proposal.
                    <br />
