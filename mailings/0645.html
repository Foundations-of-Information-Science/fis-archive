June 2002
<br />
<p>No Agenda could be prepared in Bali for the Second Earth Summit
<br />
<p>Recently ended the Conference attended by 114 ministers for the protection
<br />
of the World Natural Environment. They had intended to prepare the draft of
<br />
the Agenda for the Second Earth Summit. The Conference took place in the
<br />
island Bali (Indonesia). It had been expected that the exchange of views
<br />
would produced a document with objectives to attain in relation to the need
<br />
of reducing the poverty all over the world and about the protection of the
<br />
natural environment everywhere.
<br />
<p>It was assumed that the Second Earth Summit would be the real start of the
<br />
Sustainable Development against the prevailing developmentalism that has
<br />
continuously disregarded the need to control actions that deteriorate the
<br />
natural environments. Many participants have thought that the Conference in
<br />
Johannesburg - ten years after the First Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro -
<br />
would confirm the urgent need of Agenda 21. &quot;...blueprint for action that
<br />
calls for improving the quality of life on Earth by using natural resources
<br />
more efficiently, protecting global commons, better managing human
<br />
settlements, and reducing pollutants and chemical waste&quot;.
<br />
<p>It did not happen what it was expected. The President of the Conference in
<br />
Bali, Emil Salim - previous minister of the Natural Environment of
<br />
Indonesia - expressed his disappointment saying that sufficient goodwill
<br />
was missing in several participants. He commented that &quot;...till the last
<br />
moment we try to reduce the differences&quot; and added that it was evident how
<br />
seriously divided is the world when the interpretations of the poor
<br />
countries about the future of humankind are confronted to the
<br />
interpretations of the rich countries.
<br />
<p>One of the main reasons of disagreement is the position of the
<br />
representatives of U.S.A. who claimed that the aid for development was
<br />
conditioned by the efforts against corruption that would be implemented by
<br />
every country. Another difficulty was the demand of developing countries
<br />
asking the rich nations to open their markets to trade and transference of
<br />
technology. Instead of an open discussion on these and other questions,
<br />
Lynn Schloesser, member of the US delegation declared that his country
<br />
would do nothing beyond previous offers made in the two previous meetings
<br />
hold in Monterrey and Doha. He even claimed that &quot;Commercial and financial
<br />
representatives from all over the world have agreed a Program and it must
<br />
be allowed its continuation without interferences.&quot;
<br />
<p>Salim openly recognized that the failure in Bali means that the Summit in
<br />
Johannesburg will be necessarily difficult, however he still said that
<br />
&quot;...it is not the end of the road, and is not yet a disaster.&quot; ONU remains
<br />
claiming that the Second World Summit must generate clear objectives,
<br />
concrete measures and dispositions and precise commitments in time.

<br />
<p>The Path to the Johannesburg Summit
<br />
<p>Curtis Runyan
<br />
Magnar Norderhaug
<br />
<p><p>World leaders will meet August 26 for the World Summit in Johannesburg,
<br />
South Africa, to address once again, the multitude of environmental threats
<br />
destabilizing the planet. The question at the top of the agenda: what
<br />
progress have countries made in the past 30 years to halt environmental
<br />
hemorrhaging, and where will we go from here?
<br />
<p><p><p>In the 1960s, many people around the world began to face critical
<br />
environmental issues in their communities: forests were being destroyed by
<br />
acid rain, rivers poisoned beyond use by industrial wastes, cities choked
<br />
by pollution from automobiles and industry, Rural farmers hit by famines,
<br />
and once-rich resources reserves wearing thin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few scientists began to speak out about the global
<br />
interconnectedness of these problems, and they warned that we humans were
<br />
quickly becoming victims of our own success-that we now had the ability to
<br />
entirely despoil the earth that sustains us.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, at the U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in
<br />
Stockholm, Sweden, delegates from around the world came together to address
<br />
these warnings. while the conference produced a series of recommendations
<br />
for government action, environmental turmoil continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later, leading up to the U.N.  Earth Summit in Rio in
<br />
1992, the Royal Society of London and the U.S. National Academy of
<br />
sciences-two of the world's most prominent scientific bodies-issued a joint
<br />
declaration calling for action. &quot;The future of our planet is in the
<br />
balance. Sustainable development can be achieved, but only if irreversible
<br />
degradation of the environment can be halted in time: The next 30 years may
<br />
be crucial.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific warning have continued to grow in severity and
<br />
urgency, but progress on making change since the Stockholm conference has
<br />
remained painstakingly slow. And new international challenges-terrorist
<br />
attacks, military responses, and mounting tensions around the world-have
<br />
threatened to sidetrack the building momentum to address chronic
<br />
environmental problems. At the forthcoming Johannesburg World Summit,
<br />
environmentalists will aim to refocus the world on some of the most
<br />
critical threats to global security. That will mean seriously responding to
<br />
environmental tragedies and rapidly building on hard-won gains of the past
<br />
four decades, which are summarized in the following chronology.
<br />
<p>1962
<br />
Marine biologist Rachel Carson publishes Silent Spring, calling attention
<br />
to the threat of toxic chemicals to people and the environment
<br />
<p>1967
<br />
The Torrey Canyon oil tanker hits ground and spills 117,000 tons of oil
<br />
into the North Sea around Cornwall in the United Kingdom. The massive local
<br />
pollution helps prompt legal changes to make ship owners liable for all
<br />
spills.
<br />
<p>1968
<br />
Paul Ehrlich publishes The Population Bomb describing the ecological
<br />
threats of a rapidly growing population
<br />
<p>1968
<br />
Experts from around the world met for the first time at the U.N. Biosphere
<br />
Conference to discuss global environmental problems, including pollution,
<br />
resource loss, and wetlands destruction
<br />
<p>1970
<br />
The first Earth Day is held in the United States. Millions of people gather
<br />
around the country to demonstrate against environmental abuse, sparking the
<br />
creation of landmark environmental laws including the Endangered Species
<br />
Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
<br />
<p>1971
<br />
2,200 scientists, gathered for a conference in Menton, France, present a
<br />
message to the U.N. stressing the need for environmental action. &quot;Solutions
<br />
to the actual problems of pollution, hunger, overpopulation, and war may be
<br />
more simple to find than the formula for the common effort through which
<br />
the search for the solutions must occur, but we must make a beginning&quot;.
<br />
<p>1972
<br />
Economist Barbara Ward and microbiologist René Dubos publish Only One Earth
<br />
for the Stockholm Conference. The book warns that human actions are
<br />
undermining the Earth's ability to support us.
<br />
<p>1972
<br />
Participants from 114 countries come to Stockholm, Sweden for the U.N.
<br />
Conference on the Human Environment. Only one environment minister attends,
<br />
as most countries do not yet have environment agencies. The delegates adopt
<br />
a set of 109 specific recommendations for government action and push for
<br />
the creation of the U.N. Environment Programme.
<br />
<p>1972
<br />
The Club of Rome, a group of economists, scientists and business leaders
<br />
from 25 countries The Limits to Growth, which predicts that the Earth's
<br />
limits will be reached in 100 years at current rates of population growth,
<br />
resource depletion, and pollution generation.
<br />
<p>1972
<br />
Researchers report that three-quarters of the acid rain falling in Sweden
<br />
is caused by pollution originating in other countries.
<br />
<p>1973
<br />
Women living in Himalayan villages in Northern India begin the Chipko
<br />
movement to protect trees from clearing by commercial logging, which has
<br />
begun to cause severe deforestation, soil erosion, and flooding in the
<br />
region
<br />
<p>1973
<br />
Arab country members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
<br />
(OPEC) reduce oil exports to Europe and initiate an oil embargo against the
<br />
United States for its support of Israel in a war with Egypt and Syria.
<br />
Ineffective policies to reduce oil dependence leave industrial countries
<br />
vulnerable to Iran's 1979 revolution and subsequent reduction in oil
<br />
production sparking a second energy crisis.
<br />
<p>1973
<br />
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
<br />
and Flora (CITES) restricts trade in roughly 5,000 animal species and
<br />
25,000 plant species that are near or threatened with extinction. While the
<br />
treaty has a broad mandate, inadequate enforcement in the following years
<br />
allows a billion dollar black market in wildlife trade to flourish.
<br />
1973
<br />
The Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)
<br />
restricts the release of pollutants from ocean-going vessels. It regulates
<br />
dumping and accidental spills of oil, garbage, plastics, and sewage.
<br />
<p>1974
<br />
Chemists Sherwood Portland and Mario Molina find that chlorofluorocarbons
<br />
(CFCs) can destroy ozone molecules and may threaten to erode the Earth's
<br />
protective ozone layer
<br />
<p>1976
<br />
The U.N. Conference on Human Settlements in Vancouver British Columbia,
<br />
Canada, drafts 65 recommendations for countries about how to best to
<br />
provide shelter. Conference participants agree that adequate shelter is a
<br />
basic human right.
<br />
<p>1977
<br />
Indigenous protestors in the Philippines force the World Bank to withdraw
<br />
the financial backing for the construction of four large dams along the
<br />
Chico River. The effort to block the projects energizes a global movement
<br />
to protect rivers and resist new dam building
<br />
<p>1979
<br />
The reactor core at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in
<br />
Pennsylvania partially melts down and releases radiation into the
<br />
surrounding communities.
<br />
<p>1979
<br />
The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution helps combat acid
<br />
rain and regulate pollution traveling across national borders. A number of
<br />
protocols have been added to this &quot;framework&quot; treaty, which regulate
<br />
emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur, heavy metals, persistent organic
<br />
pollutants, and several other pollutants
<br />
<p>1981
<br />
The AIDS virus is detected in clinical studies. Within the following two
<br />
decades the virus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has killed
<br />
millions of people and undermined development efforts in many countries.
<br />
<p>1982
<br />
Mexico and other developing and Eastern bloc countries come close to
<br />
defaulting on $250 billion in international loans sparking a debt crisis.
<br />
Lenders extend additional loans to these countries to prevent default,
<br />
setting the stage for future debt disasters
<br />
<p>1982

<br />
protecting and restoring species populations
<br />
<p>1982
<br />
The UN Environment Programme organizes a special Stockholm + 10 conference
<br />
in Nairobi. The attendees agree to a declaration expressing &quot;serious
<br />
concern about the present state of the environment,&quot; and establish an
<br />
independent commission to craft a &quot;global agenda for change&quot;, paving the
<br />
way for the release of Our Common Future in 1987
<br />
<p>1983
<br />
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. National Academy of
<br />
Sciences publish reports finding that the build-up of carbon dioxide and
<br />
other &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; in the Earth's atmosphere will lead to global
<br />
warming.
<br />
<p>1984
<br />
An estimated 10,000 people are killed and many more are injured when Union
<br />
Carbide's pesticide plant in Bhopal, India leaks 40 tons of Methyl
<br />
Isocyanate gas and sends a cloud of poison into the surrounding city of 1
<br />
million.
<br />
<p>1985
<br />

<br />
<p>1986
<br />
One of the four reactors at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear power
<br />
plant explodes after a botched &quot;safety test&quot; and completely melts down. The
<br />
explosion sends radioactive particles as far away as Western Europe,
<br />
exposing hundreds of thousands of people to high levels of radiation.
<br />
<p>1987
<br />
The World Commission on Environment and Development publishes Our Common
<br />
Future (The Brundtland Report) which concludes that preserving the
<br />
environment, addressing global inequities and fighting poverty could fuel,
<br />
not hinder, economic growth by promoting sustainable development. &quot;Attempts
<br />
to maintain social and ecological stability through old approaches to
<br />
development and environmental protection will increase instability.&quot;
<br />
<p>1987
<br />
The Montreal Protocol, which has been strengthened since its inception, now
<br />
requires industrial countries to phase out production of a number of
<br />
ozone-depleting chemicals by 1996, and developing countries by 2010.
<br />
<p>1987
<br />
The Basel Convention controls movement of hazardous wastes across borders
<br />
and now outlaws exports of wastes from developed to developing countries
<br />
for final disposal.
<br />
<p>1988
<br />
Biologist E. O. Wilson publishes Biodiversity, a collection of reports from
<br />
the National Forum on BioDiversity in the United States. The book details
<br />
how humans are rapidly undermining the Earth's ability to support its
<br />
diversity of species.
<br />
<p>1988
<br />
Brazilian labor, and environmental leader, Chico Mendes is murdered by
<br />
rural cattle ranchers. Representing 70,000 rubber tappers, Mendes had
<br />
advocated using Brasil's forests sustainably as extractive reserves rather
<br />
than clearing them for timber and grazing. The killing brings international
<br />
attention to the widespread liquidation of tropical rainforests around the
<br />
world.
<br />
<p>1989
<br />
An inexperienced crewman runs the Exxon Valdez oil tanker onto a reef in
<br />
Alaska's Prince William Sound, dumping 76,000 tons of crude oil. The spill,
<br />
the largest ever in the United States, covers more than 5,100 kilometers of
<br />
pristine coastline with oil and kills more than 250,000 birds.
<br />
<p>1991
<br />
The Iraqi army, retreating from its occupation of Kuwait, destroys tankers,
<br />
oil terminals and oil wells, setting many on fire. The fighting and
<br />
sabotage leak approximately 1,25 million tons of oil, the worst oil spill
<br />
in history.
<br />
<p>1992
<br />
Bringing together 1,575 scientists from 69 countries, the Union of
<br />
Concerned Scientists issues its World Scientists' Warning to Humanity,
<br />
which states that &quot;human beings and the natural world are on a collision
<br />
course&quot;.
<br />
<p>1992
<br />
The Convention on Biological Diversity mandates that countries formulate
<br />
strategies to protect biodiversity and that industrial countries help
<br />
implement these strategies in developing countries.
<br />
<p>1992
<br />
Most countries and 117 heads of state participate in the groundbreaking
<br />
U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
<br />
(The Earth Summit). Participants adopt Agenda 21, a voluminous blueprint
<br />
for action that calls for improving the quality of life on Earth by using
<br />
natural resources more efficiently, protecting global commons, better
<br />
managing human settlements, and reducing pollutants and chemical waste.
<br />
<p>1992
<br />
The Convention on Climate Change sets non-binding CO2 reduction goals for
<br />
industrial countries (to 1990 levels by 2000). The final treaty calls for
<br />
avoiding human alteration of the climate but falls far short of
<br />
expectations, largely due to lack of support from the United States.
<br />
<p>1994
<br />
The World Conservation Union (IUCN) publishes a revised Red List of
<br />
endangered and threatened species, creating a world standard for gauging
<br />
threats to biodiversity. Current versions list 11,000 threatened or extinct
<br />
species out of about 1.75 million documented species (The Red List
<br />
estimates that the total number of species on Earth is about 13 to 14
<br />
million).
<br />
<p>1994
<br />
183 countries send delegates to the Conference on Population and
<br />
Development in Cairo, Egypt, where they set up a decades-long plan to
<br />
stabilize and reduce population growth-a plan that emphasizes the
<br />
importance of women's education and access to reproductive health care.
<br />
<p>1995
<br />
Writer and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa is hanged in Nigeria for leading the
<br />
Ogoni people's protests against environmental destruction of their lands by
<br />
Royal Dutch/Shell, Chevron, and other international oil companies.
<br />
<p>1995
<br />
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), a group of hundreds
<br />
of prominent climate scientists assembled by the U.N. in 1988, releases a
<br />
report concluding that &quot;the balance of evidence suggests that there is a
<br />
discernible human influence on global climate&quot;.
<br />
<p>1995
<br />
Representatives from 180 countries meet at the Conference on Women in
<br />
Beijing, china, to draft an agenda to improve the lives of women and girls.
<br />
The resolution includes calls for taking action to reduce soil erosion,
<br />
deforestation, and other forms of environmental degradation which often
<br />
leave women and their families impoverished.
<br />
<p>1996
<br />
Theo Colborn, John Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski publish Our Stolen Future,
<br />
which warns of reproductive threats to animals-including humans-due to the
<br />
release of billions of pounds of synthetic chemicals into the environment,
<br />
many of which mimic and disrupt natural hormones.
<br />
<p>1997
<br />
Forest Fires around the world burn more than 5 million hectares of forests
<br />
and other lands. More tropical forests are burned in 1997 than in any other
<br />
year in recorded history
<br />
<p>1997
<br />
The Kyoto Protocol strengthens the 1992 Climate Change Convention by
<br />
mandating reductions of 6 to 8 percent from 1990 emission levels by 2008 to
<br />
2012 for industrial countries. But the protocol's controversial
<br />
emissions-trading scheme and debates over the role of developing countries
<br />
cloud its future.
<br />
<p>1998
<br />
The ozone hole over Antarctica grows to 25 million square kilometers (the
<br />
previous record, set in 1993, was 3 million square kilometers)
<br />
<p>1999
<br />
Massive protests in Seatle help shut down international trade negotiations
<br />
and spotlight the environmental and social shortcomings of the World Trade
<br />
Organization.
<br />
<p>2000
<br />
The Biosafety Protocol implements a more precautionary approach to trading
<br />
genetically altered crops and organisms, and requires exporters to receive
<br />
prior consent from destination countries before shipping genetically
<br />
altered crops.
<br />
<p>2000
<br />
The Treaty on persistent Organic Pollutants requires the complete phase out
<br />
of nine persistent, highly toxic pesticides and limits the use of several
<br />
other chemicals, including dioxins, furans and PCBs
<br />
<p>2001
<br />
U.S, President George W. Bush announces that the United States will not
<br />
ratify the Kyoto Protocol, saying that the country cannot afford to reduce
<br />
CO2 emissions
<br />
<p>2001
<br />
The $3 billion Humane Genome Project reports that the human gene count is
<br />
only about 30,000-about the same as that of a weed or a mouse-not 100,000
<br />
as expected. News of the finding adds to the concerns about the wisdom of
<br />
current efforts at genetic manipulation, including inserting genes into
<br />
food crops and re-engineering animals or humans.
<br />
<p>2001
<br />
The IPPC releases a new report citing &quot;new and stronger evidence that most
<br />
of the observed warming of the last 50 years is attributable to human
<br />
activities&quot;. The new study projects that at current rates, temperatures
<br />
will increase by 1.4 to 5.8 degrees by 2100.
