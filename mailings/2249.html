Dear FIS discussants,
<br />
<p>Ana's posting on chemical informatics and XML is very relevant. Many of us 
<br />
remember her very clear FIS talk last summer in Paris. What is particularly 
<br />
relevant to our recent online discussions is the layer of logic and 
<br />
representation underlying the use of XML technologies in the natural 
<br />
sciences and elsewhere: the role of Semantic Web description and logic 
<br />
languages such as RDF and OWL. (This is a wonderful echo of the artificial 
<br />
languages and ontologies of the 17th century, e.g. Dalgarno and Wilkins.) 
<br />
If, as many of our group have voiced, there is something insufficient, or 
<br />
off-target, in contemporary relatives of first-order logic in the domain of 
<br />
life science (OWL can be viewed as a fragment of first-order logic), does 
<br />
that mean that these schemes can/should be &quot;upgraded&quot; to something that 
<br />
could be more valuable to the chemists and biologists who use them?  To a 
<br />
logic or formalism that captures what is distinctive about biochemistry, 
<br />
instead of treating this field uniformly with the same tools one would use, 
<br />
say, in financial informatics?  Is this what we have been talking about? 
<br />
Ana's raising of this issue gives us the chance to make this precise I think.
<br />
<p>And, if this is the place for it, I would very much like to hear a few more 
<br />
sentences on the application of category theory here, if indeed this is 
<br />
where it would be deployed.  It is such nice mathematics, simultaneously 
<br />
concrete (arrows and diagrams) and fabulously abstract (capturing the key 
<br />
idea of universal construction). In my filing cabinet I have an old brown 
<br />
copy of Robert Rosen's 1958 paper from the Bulletin of Mathematical 
<br />
Biophysics, casting the theory of &quot;Metabolic-Repair&quot; systems into the 
<br />
language of category theory!  (As a student in the 1980s  I reported on 
<br />
this paper in one of Michael Conrad's classes.) So for nearly half a 
<br />
century many have found the urge to employ category theory to capture what 
<br />
is unique in living systems. So, at what level can we use this kind of 
<br />
thing?  Are molecular bionetworks captured by commutative diagrams, or is 
<br />
this too literal an interpretation? And could they play a role in the 
<br />
knowledge representation and inference systems of bioinformatics?
<br />
<p>Praxis aside, there is a deep philosophical issue here of the interface 
<br />
between the formal and the material. Would mapping complex &quot;molecular 
<br />
bionetworks&quot; onto formal graphical diagrammatic structures lose something, 
<br />
well, &quot;vital&quot;? Surely their essence is not purely formal? Now, in the 
<br />
emerging ambient philosophy, the formal is deprecated, the embodied is 
<br />
valorized. There is new respect for the physical in natural computing (and 
<br />
it is the properties of biological matter that I believe give it its 
<br />
computing power, not any formal algorithms). Is there something inescapably 
<br />
material, essentially non-formal, in biological networks, that requires a 
<br />
new formalism-- and why isn't such a statement the oxymoron it appears to be?
<br />
<p>Take the recent conversation on vagueness with Stan and Loet. My first 
<br />
reaction to reading sentences like &quot;I am not as vague as I was when I was a 
<br />
blastodisc&#x2026;&quot; was to suspect a category mistake: certainly it is expressions 
<br />
(e.g. utterances) that can be vague or not vague, not things (e.g. 
<br />
organisms).  But my first reaction is an old prejudice, a mindset that is 
<br />
less useful, based on this form / substance distinction-- that vagueness is 
<br />
something linguistic.  But just as the vagueness of an utterance is 
<br />
something only meaningful as it emerges into a context, into a situation in 
<br />
the world, so too, I wonder: could we take vagueness as example of 
<br />
something that hovers on the edge of the logical and the material?
<br />
<p>This is the crux of it. To take a phrase from Gordana's paper (in Mind and 
<br />
Machines 2003), we are dealing with Theory Materialized.
<br />
