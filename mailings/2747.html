                    Dear Pedro
                    <br />
                <p>regarding social openness: &quot;very tenuous rumor may destroy an entire company, or put a sector on
                    its knees.. &quot; This can only happen if there is a fundamental reason for the company or the
                    sector to get into trouble (e.g. time before the collapse the WorldCom had been in financial
                    troubles but was corrupting its accounting data to hide it). Therefore, a rumor is only a trigger,
                    and if it is &quot;rumor&quot; only, nothing will happen to the system.
                    <br />
                <p>When I refer to {biological {sociocultural }} constraints in understanding and managing complexity I
                    primarily have in mind the nature of constraints as such, in terms that certain things cannot or are
                    not likely to happen under their influence. For example, our brains cannot handle more than 3 or 4
                    variables at one time and grasp their causative interrelations, so we have a natural heuristic
                    process that cuts trough the &quot;many&quot; and reduces it to few. This results in
                    oversimplification of the reality and overemphasizing of the variables that were not left out. A lot
                    political and economic reasoning suffers from that bias. Mathematical procedures and modeling can
                    help us with this biological constraint but math, unfortunately, did not prove itself yet to be
                    helpful to deal complex social problems. Artificial societies may be a hopeful way, but this is yet
                    to be seen.
                    <br />
                <p>Another biological constraint on our capacity to manage complex social reality is that we
                    intermittently use rational procedures and emotions, so a situation which may be solved by an
                    analytic process can erupt in conflict only because certain words have been uttered or
                    misinterpreted, which steers the whole interaction and the problem solving process in a different
                    direction. This biological trait is only partially controlled by the culture at the next integrative
                    level, trough norms and rules of behavior (institutions).
                    <br />
                <p>The impact of sociocultural constraints on managing complexity is evident form my last example on
                    managing the energy sector: there is no reason as why the energy sector could not be managed in a
                    fully planned and rational way by a group of experts who would optimize the production and
                    transmission processes. Did we need the market process to send the spacecraft to the Moon or it was
                    a large-scale project carefully managed for years before it succeeded? Or, is the carbon trading the
                    best response to climate change problem? However, the primacy of markets is part of our dominant
                    worldview, so we have the propensity to exclude other options that may do the job better or with
                    less uncertainty. So I have the feeling that as we continue to build more socio-economic complexity
                    our biological and cultral capabilities to manage it are lagging seriously behind.
                    <br />
                <p>The best
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Igor and colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the impression that there is an agreement about the existence of
                    biological and sociocultural constraints that impact on our ability to understand and manage
                    socioeconomic complexity. These constraints are organized hierarchically, as Stan puts it,
                    {biological {sociocultural }}.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree that this is the way to organize our explanations. But dynamically the real
                    world is open at all levels: very simple amplification or feed forward processes would produce
                    phenomena capable of escalating levels and percolate around (e.g., minuscule oxidation-combustion
                    phenomena initiating fires that scorch ecosystems, regions). Socially there is even more
                    &quot;openness&quot;: a very tenuous rumor may destroy an entire company, or put a sector on its
                    knees... Arguing logically about those hierarchical schemes may be interesting only for semi-closed,
                    &quot;capsule&quot; like entities, but not really for say (individuals (cities (countries)))... My
                    contention is that we should produce a new way of thinking going beyond that classical systemic,
                    non-informational view.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent, it may be a sign of diminishing returns to complexity
                    in problem solving that Joe addressed in his book &quot;The collapse of complex societies&quot;...
                    If we cannot manage the energy sector to serve certain social and economic goals, how can we hope to
                    be able to manage more complex situations like the climate change, poverty reduction and population
                    growth in the South?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did we reach the limits (cognitive and cultural) to manage our complex
                    world?
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the industrial revolution, on average every passing generation (say each 30 years)
                    has doubled both the material and the immaterial basis of societies: social wealth, income,
                    accumulated knowledge, scientific fields, technological development, social complexity... provided
                    the environment could withstand, maybe the process of generational doubling would continue around
                    almost indefinitely, or maybe not! Euristic visions like those mentioned by Igor on energy policies
                    by the UE or the US have been the usual and only tool during all previous epochs: the case is
                    whether after some critical threshold human societies cannot keep their complexity any longer... Joe
                    might agree on the &quot;necessary&quot; collapse of complex societies.
                    <br />
