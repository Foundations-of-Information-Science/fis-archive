I dare to imagine that researchers, experts and scholars who have 
<br />
recognized the potentiality of Systems Thinking supported when 
<br />
necessary by Cybernetic Interactions when searching to deal 
<br />
'scientifically' - therefore ethically - with the worst crisis ever 
<br />
faced by humankind might immediately offer enough light for helping 
<br />
millions of people to change consciously the political climate that 
<br />
has been intelligently structured --but derived from narrow minded, 
<br />
short-sighted and even blind appraisals-- for organizing another 
<br />
World War against humanity.

<br />
<p>Americans have been bushwacked by the Republicans. First there is the 
<br />
black and white division of &quot;Either you are for us or you are against 
<br />
us,&quot; followed by the outright lie that we are in a declared war. And 
<br />
due to this pseudo war, our rights have been threatened if not taken 
<br />
away, the government reorganized such that the president is directly 
<br />
in charge of it all, and now our CIA can take anyone out without a 
<br />
trial.  To finance all this, money will be diverted from social 
<br />
programs, (taken from the poor) with tax breaks given to those who 
<br />
have too much already, and will use the money to buy the land.
<br />
<p>We have become like them.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I know some would say the problem is very complex, and there isn't

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that simple way it appears to me that certain people are using the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wonder why though. What is the ulterior motive? Is it to gain

Subject: [ANSWER]: What to expect from Bush
<br />
Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2002 00:44:44 -0500
<br />
<p>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM BUSH
<br />
<p>Frustrated that Iraq appears to be cooperating with the United 
<br />
Nations' intrusive weapons inspections, the Bush Administration is 
<br />
rushing this week to proclaim that the so-called disarmament effort 
<br />
has failed: that inspections are an empty effort and the 12,000 page 
<br />
Iraqi declaration is insufficient.
<br />
<p>It is urgent that the anti-war movement not be lulled into a false 
<br />
sense of optimism because Iraq and the UN are cooperating. Various 
<br />
governments are reporting that they are hopeful that the inspections 
<br />
process can help avoid war. UN General Secretary Kofi Annan went out 
<br />
of his way to say that war is not inevitable.
<br />
<p>However, the extent to which the world is voicing cautious optimism 
<br />
about a peaceful solution, is also the extent to which the Bush 
<br />
foreign policy team is racing to dash all hope for such an outcome. 
<br />
There is now an almost perfect inverted ratio between the worldwide 
<br />
clamor for restraint and peace and the Bush Administration's 
<br />
eagerness to publicly announce that war is certain.
<br />
<p>By the end of this week, we can expect that Bush will try to announce 
<br />
that Iraq has failed to come clean about its purported weapons 
<br />
program. Then the war mobilization can go onto automatic pilot and 
<br />
the gauntlet will be thrown down to the vacillators: &quot;Are you with Us 
<br />
or Them?&quot; In so doing, the White House will inadvertently reveal a 
<br />
truth known to all objective observers of this conflict -- that the 
<br />
disarmament of Iraq was never really the issue. The nuclear scare was 
<br />
to keep Americans frightened of the &quot;enemy&quot; as the Bush Hawks 
<br />
frantically prepared to wage aggression against a country that 
<br />
possesses 10% of the world's known oil reserves.
<br />
<p>The administration has a real objective and a stated objective. The 
<br />
real objective is to wage war against Iraq and conquer and occupy 
<br />
that country. To do so requires 1) overwhelming force and 2) the 
<br />
elimination of dissenting opposition that can derail Bush's dreams of 
<br />
empire. The U.S. has massive force. But it has encountered formidable 
<br />
opposition from people around the world and in the United States. So, 
<br />
the Bush administration shifted its claimed objective from regime 
<br />
change to disarmament, a much more palatable purported objective for 
<br />
public distribution and one that can be embraced by even those who 
<br />
support peace.
<br />
<p>The White House wants to get the people of the U.S. behind this 
<br />
claimed objective of &quot;disarmament.&quot; Once having done so, the 
<br />
administration can insist that the mechanisms in place for the 
<br />
purported disarmament have failed, or cannot accomplish the task, and 
<br />
that military might is necessary.
<br />
<p>There is only one reason that makes the war drive rapidly escalate in 
<br />
the face of the apparent success of the new inspections process: The 
<br />
Bush Administration has never intended the &quot;inspections&quot; process to 
<br />
serve as anything but a trigger for war. This is why the Iraqi 
<br />
cooperation with the inspection process and disclosure has failed to 
<br />
produce even the slightest slowing in the preparations for war and, 
<br />
in fact, has seemed to produce an escalation in the rhetoric from 
<br />
Washington, including recent policy statements confirming Bush's 
<br />
plans for first-use deployment of nuclear weapons. The Washington 
<br />
Post reported that a classified version of the new Bush Doctrine 
<br />
&quot;breaks with the fifty years of counter-proliferation efforts&quot; by 
<br />
planning for the use of nuclear weapons against countries that not 
<br />
only have not attacked the US but that do not themselves possess 
<br />
nuclear capability (&quot;Preemptive Strikes are Part of U.S. Strategic 
<br />
Doctrine,&quot; front page, December 11, 2002).
<br />
<p>These signals from the White House and Pentagon provide no basis for 
<br />
optimism to believe that the war has been averted. The inspections 
<br />
process, whose true purpose is solely to serve as a trigger for war, 
<br />
at the moment is not providing the political cover that Washington 
<br />
needs to attack Iraq and seize its oil and land.
<br />
<p>The warmongers in the Bush Administration will need now to 
<br />
manufacture other circumstances to justify an attack and occupation 
<br />
of Iraq.
<br />
<p>The Bush Administration rammed Resolution 1441 through the Security 
<br />
Council for one reason: to provide the diplomatic fig leaf for a US 
<br />
war. To the extent that the process serves as a political restraint, 
<br />
Bush and Co. will scuttle the process.
<br />
<p>The Administration now needs a new trigger. It will use the 
<br />
resolution 1441 to create an obvious source of provocation. The U.S. 
<br />
forced language into the resolution that would allow for the forcible 
<br />
removal of Iraqi scientists, government officials, and their families 
<br />
and children to be held incommunicado in other countries and 
<br />
interrogated by U.N. inspectors.
<br />
<p>The U.S. wants to abduct Iraqi officials and interrogate them 
<br />
planning that by threat or bribe one will help create the trigger 
<br />
that the U.S. desperately needs and the &quot;evidence&quot; that the U.S. has 
<br />
long claimed to have but has never put up. One need only remember the 
<br />
Gulf of Tonkin resolution, the Pentagon Papers, or even the lie 
<br />
manufactured about the Iraqi army throwing babies out of incubators 
<br />
(put in cite) to judge the quality of results likely produced by this 
<br />
effort.
<br />
<p>In the New York Times for December 16, 2002, William Safire urges 
<br />
that Iraqi scientists should be visited at home, removed to other 
<br />
countries by helicopter on the spot, and be threatened that they must 
<br />
provide the right answers in order to &quot;ameliorate sentences at 
<br />
war-crimes trials.&quot; And of course, any failure of Iraq to facilitate 
<br />
these abductions will itself be considered &quot;material breach&quot; of the 
<br />
Security Council resolution.
<br />
<p>There is really only one restraint that can block the war. It lies 
<br />
within the people themselves. Neither Congress nor the Security 
<br />
Council will stop Bush's dangerous war drive. The optimism of the 
<br />
antiwar forces must be premised on reality. If we can mobilize the 
<br />
millions - in the US and around the world - and ignite a firestorm of 
<br />
activism then the political climate can be changed, and changed 
<br />
dynamically.
<br />
<p>Public opinion is Bush's enemy. Time is also an enemy for the 
<br />
war-makers. With each passing the day antiwar momentum grows. The 
<br />
global desire for a peaceful outcome is considered subversive because 
<br />
from that sentiment can emerge a potent mass movement - as happened 
<br />
during the Vietnam era.
<br />
<p>With the cooperation of the Corporate-owned media, the White House 
<br />
has attempted to create a false myth of consensus about the war. 
<br />
False polls, false reports and non-stop propaganda have filled the 
<br />
airwaves so that the American people will be paralyzed and confused. 
<br />
Yet people all over the country are talking to their neighbors, 
<br />
co-workers, fellow students, and congregations and learning that they 
<br />
too oppose Bush's war, that there is, in fact, widespread, deep, and 
<br />
passionate opposition to the war.
<br />
<p>When hundreds of thousands marched on October 26th, the same 
<br />
corporate media tried to whiteout the sudden emergence of this 
<br />
movement. But they were confronted by overwhelming demand for truth 
<br />
from people across the country and some were forced to correct their 
<br />
coverage.
<br />
<p>The peoples movement continues to grow by leaps and bounds.
<br />
<p>On January 18, massive protest will again fill the streets of 
<br />
Washington DC and San Francisco. Thousands of cities, towns, college 
<br />
campuses, high schools, religious and civil rights organizations are 
<br />
mobilizing together.
<br />
<p>The scenario for January 18th includes a brief rally on the West side 
<br />
of the Capitol Building in Washington DC starting at 11 am, followed 
<br />
by a massive march to the Washington DC Navy Yard -- a massive 
<br />
military installation located in a working class neighborhood in 
<br />
Southeast Washington DC that parks warships on the Anacostia River. 
<br />
We will demand the immediate elimination of US weapons of mass 
<br />
destruction and a people's inspection team will call for unfettered 
<br />
access and a full declaration of U.S. non-conventional weapons 
<br />
systems.
