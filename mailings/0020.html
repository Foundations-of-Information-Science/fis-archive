<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafael's concern
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;trying to get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more deeply in the understanding of your concern about the present 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tenseand the present progressive tense etc. 
</em><br />
<p>has actually straightened me up. Let me try to say what I want to 
<br />
say in a plain language, though I don't know whether I could 
<br />
succeed.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My starting point is this: Any dynamic behavior in progress
<br />
is descriptively in the mode of the present progressive tense.
<br />
Dynamics starts from the present progressive, no matter how 
<br />
awkward it may look. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the present progressive tense can 
<br />
allow behavioral agents other than the author who decribes it. 
<br />
Imagine, for instance, I am walking through a crowd as avoiding 
<br />
collisions with other people. Then, I can see that other people 
<br />
are doing the same. That is, I am walking through the crowd as 
<br />
collisions with other people being avoided. The statement of 
<br />
my waliking in the present progressive tense makes others beside
<br />
myself active agents, also. Of course, they are active observers.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that if we still adhere to the practice of 
<br />
describing any dynamics in the present tense, it will be 
<br />
required for us to construct a bridge between the present 
<br />
progressive and the present tense. One candidate for this is 
<br />
via the present perfect tense. If the presence of globally 
<br />
perfected movement is guaranteed, global synchronous time as an 
<br />
attribute of the presence can serve as a reference against which 
<br />
statements in the present tense are made possible. Such a 
<br />
global synchronous time can have a static attribute and can be 
<br />
parameterized accordingly. When I talked about the presence of 
<br />
perfected movement in the above, a hockey puck sliding on an ice 
<br />
rink almost frictionlessly was in mind. 
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more candidate approaching the present tense is via the 
<br />
past progressive tense. Since the past progressive tense can 
<br />
already be in the record, it has to satisfy the principle of the 
<br />
excluded middle. What is needed for the transference from the 
<br />
past progressive to the present tense is the presence of the 
<br />
activity for fulfilling the principle. When I was walking
<br />
through the crowd as avoiding collisions with other people,  
<br />
the avoiding activity has successfully been conducted up to the 
<br />
point the record has been registered, though the walking has not 
<br />
yet been perfected. My walking yet to come is going to avoid 
<br />
collisions with other people, since walking and colliding exclude 
<br />
each other. Local time associated with the presence of the local 
<br />
activity for fulfilling the principle of the excluded middle is
<br />
definitely involved in the synchronization with other local time
<br />
in the nehborhood because the principle extends towards the entire
<br />
discourse. But, no global synchronous time is available. What is 
<br />
possible instead is a delayed or skewed scynchronization at best,
<br />
the latter of which is quite difficult to be decipered in terms of
<br />
global synchronous time.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a rough sketch I have now. What concerns me is 
<br />
the relationship between the issue of information and local time
<br />
as a local activity based upon the grammatology of our ordinary 
<br />
languages. How about that?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koichiro
