<p>
I cannot say that I understand very deeply the deep structure behind
<br />
&quot;consilience&quot;. The term may describe an introspective experience of
<br />
understanding, setting into relation, getting the inner structure of
<br />
SEEMINGLY UNRELATED aspects of cognition. If it were closely related
<br />
similarities, the intellectual reward would be less than which merits a
<br />
&quot;Wov, by Jove! That's consilience for you!...&quot; type specific intensity. So,
<br />
the attribute of what is a consilience and what is it not does not reside in
<br />
the subject-matter but, again, in the spectator. (For someone to whom
<br />
pencils, quills, pens and crayons do not fall into one category, it may be
<br />
an experience of consilience that one can use each of them to write).
<br />
If everything is too much related, we often speak about a psychotic
<br />
incident; the opposite case, that the glue, making the inner concepts and
<br />
feelings carry a sense of belonging-together, is below a critical threshold,
<br />
is usually referred to as a depression, but this is only tradition. No one
<br />
has any idea why and how we have the &quot;feeling of evidence&quot; which tells us
<br />
that heretofore unrelated inner experiences (concepts, ideas, feelings) now
<br />
belong together. The understanding is a key mechanism and of course we
<br />
cannot easily understand the mechanism of understanding (try watching your
<br />
own eyes from the inside).
<br />
This psycho-talk aside, I'd like to comment on Malcolm's point of the close
<br />
relation between predicting and recognising. There is reason to assume that
<br />
both are the same as far as the brain is concerned. We measure on animals
<br />
whether they have learnt the use (or the attributes) of something by
<br />
watching them become predictable in their relation to the thing. &quot;If it
<br />
behaves like ... then it is ...&quot; seems to be a very common-sense and usual
<br />
way of dealing with experiences of the brain. (The term &quot;experiences of the
<br />
brain&quot; is a very broad category, encompassing virtually anything but the
<br />
subject-matter /reason, cause/ of inhibitions and taboos.) So, I see no
<br />
great benefits in splitting up the properties of our brain productions into
<br />
&quot;I - statically - believe this to have properties {a,b,c,...}&quot; and &quot;I -
<br />
dynamically - believe this to do {q,w,r,s,...}&quot;. In fact, my constant
<br />
nagging in this chatroom about combing together how something is now and how
<br />
it shall become in the future centers exactly around the idea that these
<br />
aspects are distinct only in our brain. Really, I believe that our brain
<br />
processes momentary and predictive processes in somewhat different fashions.
<br />
(As in this trade, psychology, there is a tradition that anyone may and is
<br />
encouraged to offer any theories about thinking and understanding, because
<br />
there can be no right way of understanding humans, I respectfully offer this
<br />
great theory without any pretence of importance or exactitude or sense.
<br />
Theories on how understanding works are dozen to a dime and neither of them
<br />
is more true that any of the competing ones. A psychological theory has the
<br />
scientific value of a poem or a painting - you like it, ok, you don't like
<br />
it, tant pis. We can always make experiments to prove that what we want the
<br />
experiment to prove.)
<br />
That the brain makes us distinguish between the stable, static aspect of a
<br />
thing and its dynamic, predictable properties is ok, but has probably
<br />
nothing to do with the thing and its place in the flow of Nature. We should
<br />
distinguish between errors ex introspection and errors ex unfitting
<br />
theories. In the former case, we talk about ourselves, in the latter, about
<br />
our ideas about what is outside of us. We may want to pretend that we talk
<br />
about objective reality but we build our objective laws in the subjective
<br />
grey matter.
<br />
Now to Malcolm's point: &quot;That consilience [ ... with ... Newton's theory
<br />
... ] is achieved by the fact that Kepler's constant and g provide
<br />
independent measurements of the earth's mass, where these measurements agree
<br />
numerically.&quot; At last, here we have found solid terrain under the feet. If
<br />
you can root it into the numbering system, then it is rational. A numeric
<br />
relation is momentary, but it also gives rise to some consequences. It is
<br />
again the dynamic and static aspects that interplay. We have made TWO sets
<br />
of numeric beliefs: the static, background raster (rooster?; grid) of
<br />
unmovable facts and the dynamic, function aspects of relations and
<br />
functions. This appears to be a cultural misunderstanding of our ancestors.
<br />
One can imagine the numbering system to be a stable and static grid as
<br />
usefully as 4 elephants carrying the Earth on their back. The concepts give
<br />
you a good solid feeling of stability and permanence. The only lamentable
<br />
aspect is that it has no uses outside psychic comfort. We have to get out of
<br />
the superstition phase of natural philosophy and discard ideas that place
<br />
concepts far apart: infinity, stability, places, entropy. If one has a
<br />
clear-cut antagonist to the concept, then it probably fulfills a seductive
<br />
need without an access to its grown-up meaning (like the ideas of fair
<br />
maiden, noble savage, dear leader, etc.). Once one has built polarised
<br />
concepts, it is an exciting experience of consilience that they SURPRISE
<br />
belong together under some aspects. De-polarising or not building up
<br />
antagonisms in the first place (in one's natural philosophy) lessens the
<br />
importance of overcoming them. So, I argue that it is promising to look into
<br />
&quot;how is it now&quot; and &quot;when shall it again be like this&quot;, as they are
<br />
basically the same but have some very interesting surprises in store.
<br />
<p>Hope that this is not too much off the main red thread.
<br />
Karl
