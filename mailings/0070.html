<p>
dear Jerry &amp; co-discussants;
<br />
<p>Many thanks for your stimulating comments. Here it is a brief (?) response
<br />
to them:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Should information be limited to operations on space - time objects or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should material objects be admitted into the discussion?  Tom S. at NCI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has focused on the materiality of DNA information as manifested in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequences of material objects - the individual bases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If physical objects are admitted into the discussion, how are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material attributes to be enumerated and counted as 'information'?
</em><br />
<p>That's the point. As far as I know, apart from Javorszky there has been no
<br />
other explorations on how one may count the number of logical distinctions
<br />
one could make upon a set of N elements, when one is free to arbitrarily
<br />
accumulate &quot;signs&quot; upon the elements of N. Once some upper limit of states
<br />
is reached, further accumulation of signs (properties) upon such elements
<br />
creates mere redundancy, without any new logical state. The mathematical
<br />
tool proposed to explore the successive decompositions of N in
<br />
&quot;qualitative&quot; properties is PARTITIONAL CALCULUS (a tool already used by
<br />
classical cryptographers), it is to say, the additive decomposition of N
<br />
into all its possible summands.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not understand how the term &quot;compositional&quot; is being used here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the sense of matheamtical functions ( f &#x2022; g &#x2022; h ) over a sequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sets?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What would be the nature of the objects being composed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>José Pastor (computer scientist &amp; cryptographer, also fis-discussant) and I
<br />
are proposing the term of &quot;compositional info&quot; to denote the use of a set
<br />
of N elements accumulating a certain number of signs in order to transmit
<br />
messages (info) between subjects. Given that any positional order of
<br />
messages has to be disregarded here, we believe that the dycotomy
<br />
&quot;positional&quot; (Shannon, or even von Neumann scheme) versus &quot;compositional&quot;
<br />
(Javorszkian scheme) may be illustrative.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not understand the proposed relations between compositions and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;min / max.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you be more explicit in the nature of the counting operations and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the functions?
</em><br />
<p><p>Do you mind if we wait to our presentation (José and me) in the bio
<br />
discussion? otherwise it becomes too long an answer.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How would one distinguish between the term &quot;strange way of existence&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and non-stationary systems which have a &quot;kernel&quot; of stability but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;otherwise fluctuate in dimensionality?  Other evolutionary examples of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such systems could be given...
</em><br />
<p>Personally, I find more parsimonious &quot;info entities&quot; or info &quot;societies&quot; (a
<br />
la Whitehead...)
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe that our current state of knowledge is sufficient to organize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems in terms of the &quot;degrees of organization&quot; - which may be related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to Pedro's 'vertical' information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem becomes how to define the interrelationships between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures of different degrees of organization - such as an atom, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cell, a human being and a social system.  Is the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these objects merely information or is it also scale and materiality and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships with external systems?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<p>von Bertalanffy, founding father of systems theory, was citing Dyonisius
<br />
Aeropagita as the author of the first vertical systemic scheme (more
<br />
celestially oriented than mundane...) Actually it was Dyonisius Exiguus,
<br />
around 520 AD. It is a very curious and interesting story, including the
<br />
generalized confussion between both authors, because it seems that this
<br />
funny vertical scheme, fueled by the religious prestige of the former but
<br />
crafted by the latter, represented one of the startpoints of the
<br />
non-aristotelian physics, culminating later on in the &quot;impetus&quot; doctrine
<br />
and the Galilean revolution... Let me please use this anecdote to argue
<br />
that, almost in every historical period, we have had &quot;sufficient knowledge&quot;
<br />
as you say &quot;to organize systems&quot; hierarchically, with a sense of
<br />
completion. Fortunately, from time to time, sufficient paradoxes and
<br />
&quot;chinks&quot; in the sci.armour have been found, disorganizing and reorganizing
<br />
the sci. conceptual establishment. Is the info topic  a little part of one
<br />
of these strategic reorganizations? Somehow, that's what we are
<br />
exploring... One of the underlying most serious conflicts I see is between
<br />
info and the physical concept of &quot;state&quot;. I would love hearing about that
<br />
from our physicists.
<br />
<p>bests
<br />
