Bertalanffy Anniversary Conference
<br />
<p>UNITY through DIVERSITY
<br />
<p>November 1-4, 2001, in Vienna
<br />
<p>University of Vienna and Vienna University of Technology
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
<p>in the Böckl-Saal (first floor)
<br />
of the University of Technology of Vienna (in the old building)
<br />
Technische Universität Wien
<br />
located  in Karlsplatz 13 (*), A-1040 Vienna (AUSTRIA)
<br />
<p><p>Ludwig von Bertalanffy, the founder of the General Systems Theory, was born
<br />
100 years ago. This is a perfect occasion and his native city of Vienna is
<br />
the proper place to review those of his ideas which have left their traces
<br />
on current systems thinking. It is in the interest of the whole scientific
<br />
community to evaluate the impact the humanistic ideals - which Bertalanffy
<br />
formulated for the era of globalisation - have had on the development of
<br />
science.
<br />
<p>FORUM for presentation of papers, lectures, speeches, posters and also an
<br />
Open Space for self-organized debates and discussions.
<br />
<p>(*) Karlsplatz 13 is located in one of the borders of Ressel Park. It can
<br />
be accessed through underground (U-bahn U4, and also U2 and U1), Station
<br />
Karl Platz, Exit Ressel Park. It is the old building of Vienna University
<br />
of Technology (Technische Universität Wien) in front of the end of this
<br />
exit (300 meters). You just cross the Park.
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br />
<p><p>You are welcome to participate in BAC 2001, bearing in mind what is the
<br />
main purpose of BAC 2001.
<br />
<p>First of all studying carefully some of the main aspects of BAC 2001 in
<br />
<a href="../../www.bertalanffy.org/default.htm">http://www.bertalanffy.org</a>
<br />
<p>Secondly trying to grasp how may be identified a way forward for the human
<br />
species - which is nearly to be an endangered one, condemned to extinction
<br />
by the intelligent decision making exerted during the last 7 millennia and
<br />
aggravated enormously fast during the last century due to the increasing
<br />
arrogance of leaders (?) fighting in order to reinforce the power of their
<br />
cliques, who have succeeded in using scientific knowledge and technological
<br />
innovations for maintaining billions of second class humans as human
<br />
resources, which are only living objects that should work (when there are
<br />
posts available) or accept to be killed or die by starvation, in the name
<br />
of the magnificent civilization that prevails at the dawn of the 3rd
<br />
millenium in order to support the increasing entertainment, amusement,
<br />
diversion, recreation, distraction, etc. etc. of the elites, which
<br />
altogether constitute the spirit of the so called civilized way of life. A
<br />
tentative proposal for learning to identify such a kind of way forward is
<br />
the main aim of the expected debate that will take place in the seven
<br />
symposia of BAC 2001 (*)
<br />
<p>Best regards
<br />
<p>elohimjl
<br />
<p>.
<br />
ps. (*) Revised version of the content of every symposium in the order they
<br />
will be examined (November 1 to 4, 2001).
<br />
<p>i. New Image of Man and Woman supported by a new General Anthropology: The
<br />
main question that humans need to examine is to find out what kind of
<br />
wo/men are needed in the 21st century for making possible to reconceive how
<br />
every human individually may develop his/her personality taking into
<br />
account that:
<br />
<p>1) other 6 billion individuals must and will as well  to organize their
<br />
individualities;
<br />
<p>2) the biodiversity that made possible the emergence of the homo sapiens
<br />
sapiens should be maintained and improved (not at all for making profitable
<br />
business, efficient trade or lucrative financial transactions) in order to
<br />
increase the survival chances of humans on the Earth while learning to
<br />
fairly share the terrestrial environments with all the other animals,
<br />
plants, fungi...;
<br />
<p>3) the features of the whole planet that made possible the emergence of
<br />
life in this miniscule point of the Universe are not granted forever,
<br />
neither can be preserved whatever humans may imagine they could locally,
<br />
regionally and globally do through their disrupted minds, conditioned by
<br />
selfish ambitions.
<br />
<p>...bearing in mind that there are human minds that have succeeded in
<br />
increasing the danger of dehumanizing humans (through robotomorphism and
<br />
zoomorphism) as Bertalanffy denounced since the 1960s. The trend of actions
<br />
&quot;scientifically&quot; organized in order to design the behavioral engineering
<br />
(Skinner) based on an assumed science of behavior control (Watson) derived
<br />
from the knowledge acquired of conditioned reflexes in rats (Pavlov) has
<br />
been maintained until today with the aim of genetically creating super
<br />
humans who will be served by the society conceived by Skinner &quot;The problem
<br />
is to design a world which will be liked not by people as they are now but
<br />
by those who will live in it&quot;   Behaviorism implicitly leads towards
<br />
totalitarianism (either a benevolent one, as in Huxley's Brave New World,
<br />
or a malevolent one, as in Orwell's 1984) that aims at increasing the
<br />
control of people.
<br />
<p>...searching consequently reliable ways for building the interdisciplinary
<br />
enterprise (comprising human biology, psychology, psychiatry, sociology,
<br />
linguistics, economics, the arts,...) that may help to create societal
<br />
circumstances needed for allowing the individual emergence during the life
<br />
of every person searching on his/her own to consciously develop his/her
<br />
peculiar personality, while learning to exert humanely his/her intrinsic
<br />
spontaneity when unavoidably being confronted to diverse cultural, economic
<br />
and social conditions determined peculiarly by the performance of all the
<br />
other humans that constitute every human society,...
<br />
<p>Bertalanffy aware of this danger considered necessary to find out a &quot;new
<br />
science of man&quot; or general anthropology &quot;The image of man is not only a
<br />
theoretical question,... it is a question of the preservation of man as
<br />
human&quot;
<br />
<p><p><p><p>ii. The creation of a sustainable society depends on Innovative Systems
<br />
Thinking: However valid the requirement of creating the necessary
<br />
conditions for allowing every human being to develop as best as possible
<br />
his/her individual personality - in accordance with ethical, ethological,
<br />
biological and ecological criteria - human beings at the dawn of the 3rd
<br />
millennium are facing an increasing number of global problems
<br />
(paradoxically and even contradictorily) created by the higher kind of
<br />
intelligence that has generated the evolutionary forces. These problems are
<br />
today the source of the worst crisis ever faced by the human species. It
<br />
has become childish, frivolous, silly and even stupid to continue
<br />
maintaining through narrow minded and shortsighted  intelligent decisions -
<br />
very often based on a very efficient but quite selfish systems analysis -
<br />
the trends of civilizing  (?) processes that have become ethically,
<br />
ethologically, biologically and ecologically unsustainable.
<br />
<p>It is perhaps not yet too late to assume that the scientific community
<br />
supported by the Bertalanffian Systems Thinking has potentially the
<br />
capability to create - everywhere on the planet - the necessary
<br />
circumstances that would allow us, the humans alive at present, to start
<br />
creating a humane WAY FORWARD for humankind learning to be conscious enough
<br />
of the terrestrial possibilities, which are not granted forever: On the
<br />
other side we might be just in time of taking seriously into account that
<br />
the chaotic growth of the homosphere during only the last 8 millennia of
<br />
civilizing (?) efforts has become the main cause of the deterioration of
<br />
the whole biosphere and the gradual destruction of the ecosphere, due to
<br />
the very simplified manner the human intelligence has been exerted
<br />
<p>We know that the extent of destruction of the soils, the seas, or the
<br />
atmosphere (global warming), the iniquitous operation of the banking
<br />
system, the inadequacy of government policy requires documentation at a
<br />
systems level, putting together the disconnected scraps of information to
<br />
form an overall picture, because moving forward demands an attempt to
<br />
understand the problem so as to be able to intervene in the system.
<br />
Besides, to move forward makes necessary to study the socio-cybernetic
<br />
processes which drive the system or to seek to outline the developments
<br />
that are required to introduce a more effective socio-cybernetic system.
<br />
The question is: how are we to identify and map these systemic forces and
<br />
how are we to design a more effective socio cybernetic approach. (John
<br />
Raven)
<br />
<p>Consequently the main task for the personalities that manage to emerge is
<br />
to continuously explore how  General Systems Weltanschauung,  as a
<br />
methodological tool, may help in identifying reliable views about the world
<br />
situation, that are needed for creating feasible ways to reach Sustainable
<br />
Development as a steady state or flow equilibrium of the  dynamics of the
<br />
homosphere. Today this steady state is in danger of being abruptly and
<br />
irreversibly broken because the Homosphere, which comtinues growing, is
<br />
causing faster and faster not only the destruction of fragile areas of the
<br />
Biosphere but also the crack of essential elements of the  Ecosphere
<br />
(elohimjl)
<br />
<p><p><p>iii. Business based on Bertalanffy's Weltanschauung: However to create a
<br />
sustainable society or even to find out how to make sustainable the humane
<br />
presence of humans in time and in space makes indispensable to build
<br />
optional circumstances needed for the emergence of a new ENTREPRENEURSHIP
<br />
SPIRIT. The spirit required for leading business to be oriented by the
<br />
&quot;Weltanschauung&quot; suggested by Bertalanffy, as the  global awareness that
<br />
may generate the ecological, biological, ethological &amp; ethical values
<br />
needed:
<br />
<p>1)	for taking care of the proper preservation of GAIA's features;
<br />
<p>2)	for maintaining the BIODIVERSITY that may help humans to learn how
<br />
to increase the survival chances of our species;
<br />
<p>3)	for making feasible to interpret humanely and implement cogently a
<br />
Terrestrial Bill of HUMAN RIGHTS and COMMITMENTS learning to share the
<br />
terrestrial environment with all the other living species.
<br />
<p>Systems Thinking is a methodological tool for improving: the functioning of
<br />
companies and firms as open systems composed by parts (departments) that
<br />
presumably can work better, while learning each one and altogether to
<br />
establish and maintain the necessary communications among them, the
<br />
financial, marketing, maintenance,... issues, certainly helps to improve
<br />
the decision making. However, it has become increasingly dangerous to
<br />
continue ignoring the deterioration of the economic, social and cultural
<br />
surroundings generated by the increasing efficiently competitiveness .
<br />
Competitive companies, in circumstances that have been imposed, tend
<br />
exclusively to expand their dominion in order to increase their monetary
<br />
profits and financial revenues while basic needs of most people are not
<br />
taken into account. The increasing unemployment, the unfair trade organized
<br />
by most competitive organizations, the growing poverty and misery of masses
<br />
of people (billions at present), the larger number of immigrants to cities
<br />
and rich countries,... are now the factors that need to be taken into
<br />
account by the Entrepreneurship spirit needed at the dawn of the 21st
<br />
century.
<br />
<p>Managers and decision makers must recognize today, before it might be too
<br />
late, that humankind must not be disassembled by means of successful (?)
<br />
competitive firms managed by wealthy entrepreneurs who take advantage of
<br />
the endeavour of well paid workers and employees on one side. Such a kind
<br />
of successs is the main cause that keeps increasing the number of
<br />
unemployed people and poor and miserable customers who become desperate
<br />
beings trying to learn, whatever the means, how to survive the next day.
<br />
<p><p><p>iv. Wholism (or Holism) The way forward into the 21st century. From now
<br />
onward, starting in this year 2001, the task of the scientific community in
<br />
figurative terms might be based in searching further and further, how human
<br />
beings may learn to develop their way of thinking for clearly seeing the
<br />
forest before they may start dealing with one or another tree; and also for
<br />
grasping the meaning of a tree before trying to handle one of the leaves or
<br />
a flower or a fruit.
<br />
<p>This intention takes into account that the Bacon's experimental method and
<br />
the Galileo's resolutive or analytic method - which made possible the
<br />
emergence of the scientific method against the methaphysical approach
<br />
(apparently holistic) of the middle Ages - have caused an increasing number
<br />
of larger difficulties to the evolvement of human thinking which
<br />
intrinsically searchs first to get a gestalt, global, molar, integrative,
<br />
organismic, synergistic,...or holistic or wholistic.view of the reality.
<br />
Humans could not survive if they were not capable of getting immediately
<br />
holistic insights about their concerns. But humans may and perhaps even
<br />
should push ahead the evolvement of their thinking recognizing (W)Holism as
<br />
an indispensable step.
<br />
<p>(W)Holism is an approach that transcends both the metaphysical approach of
<br />
the Middle Ages and the scientific method, which has shown during the last
<br />
century that the successful conquest and transformation of natural
<br />
resources carried out by masses of people employed as human resources
<br />
generates huge and quite undesirable effects (wrongly qualified as side
<br />
ones) that make its assumed positive contributions more and more
<br />
questionable. (W)Holism is potentially more than just a  global,
<br />
integrative or gestalt view that simply states that the &quot;whole is more than
<br />
the sum of its parts&quot; or that 'everything is interrelated with everything
<br />
else.&quot; Its belated emergence as a truly organismic and synergistic view of
<br />
life on this planet has started to help an increasing number of
<br />
researchers, scholars and experts to recognize  that wholes and parts are
<br />
all moulded into an inseparable multilevelled continuum, a living matrix.
<br />
The ecosphere, the biosphere, the homosphere, the forest, the tree, the
<br />
leaves, the cells in the leaves, the living beings,...   and the molecules
<br />
are integral components of a substance composed (very diversely) of
<br />
matter-energy-information  which human beings should not continue dividing
<br />
unilaterally for making short term monetary and financial profits. At
<br />
present, humankind faces  global problems reaching a crisis point. The main
<br />
reason for this is that  prevailing decision-making processes completely
<br />
ignore the need for respecting a wholeness required to counteract the
<br />
devastating consequences of 'scientific' fragmentation.
<br />
<p><p><p>v. Development of Perspectivism, as a Systems Epistemology: It is indeed
<br />
indispensable to use a w/holistic approach in order to deal with the
<br />
serious crisis that faces humankind at present, but we cannot even try to
<br />
identify the absolutely right w/holistic interpretation of the reality,
<br />
because there are as many view points to take into account as many humans
<br />
as observers may dare in a certain instant to express why and what  they
<br />
have grasped and how they managed to grasp it, as stated in the uncertainty
<br />
principle suggested by Werner Heisenberg. Therefore, it is needed to make
<br />
explicitly evident how the validity of knowledge depends partially on every
<br />
PERSPECTIVE from which that knowledge is perceived and subsequently to make
<br />
clearer how an increasing number of disciplinary and mutidisciplinary
<br />
w/holistic views (it is the Bertalanffian Perspectivism) are unavoidably
<br />
the reliable way of getting closer and closer, though diversely, to the
<br />
'absolute truth' of every aspect of the whole reality. Obviously not  all
<br />
the perspectives, as views explicitly expressed of a certain aspect of the
<br />
reality, are necessarily valid. But among those which are relatively
<br />
acceptable none of them is more authentic than the other. The Bertalanffian
<br />
Perspectivism is the proper alternative between nihilism - the rejection to
<br />
make an effort towards the absolut truth because it is something impossible
<br />
to reach - and absolutism - the dogmatism that has generated the scientism,
<br />
which assigns value to nothing but science itself; and has produced the
<br />
bloodstained fanaticism in religious and political actions
<br />
<p>The Bertalanffy's perspectivism in practice oblige every learned person,
<br />
while learning, to be aware of his/her relative ignorance, and to recognize
<br />
that using his/her brain to the utmost he/she must increasingly try to be
<br />
aware of the limits of his/her (human) powers of cognition, because
<br />
&quot;perception is not a reflection of 'real things' [but rather] is an
<br />
interaction between knower and known&quot;. It means that the result of every
<br />
observation is partly the result of the viewpoint and methodology of the
<br />
observer.This Perspectivism as Systems Epistemology is based on the
<br />
assumption that all what seems to be objective perception of real facts and
<br />
events is filtered by the biological features of the observer and his/her
<br />
psychocultural achievements.
<br />
<p><p><p>vi. General Systems Theory as a Methodological Maxim.  Gerard de Zeeuw has
<br />
expressed &quot;Humanity has learnt many wonderful things over the past few
<br />
centuries, (although) new and serious difficulties have accrued that are
<br />
part of the same wonderful process of learning. These include... a
<br />
weakening of ethics, poor social solidarity; increasing social neurosis;
<br />
miserable conditions for billions of people affected by new diseases.
<br />
...humanity may need a different form of learning, ...co-operation and the
<br />
influence of collectives on individuals and vice versa. They require forms
<br />
of thinking and acting that emphasise ecological, ethological and ethical
<br />
considerations, and that concentrate on supporting and advancing the
<br />
harmonious evolvement of biodiversity. It seems proper to develop such
<br />
forms of thinking, being supported by the work of one of the first and
<br />
still foremost thinkers in this area, that is Ludwig von Bertalanffy. &quot;
<br />
<p>Derived from these arguments, it has been assumed that it has become
<br />
urgently indispensable to create in the homosphere the necessary conditions
<br />
for creating socially a New Image of Man and Woman that may allow the
<br />
emergence of humans learning to develop their personalities for  building a
<br />
way forward towards the Creation of a Sustainable Society, being it
<br />
supported by Business based on Bertalanffy's Weltanschauung; complemented
<br />
by societal systems engaged in restructuring those that are functioning at
<br />
present in order to build a new homosphere that may deal gradually with the
<br />
global problems (unemployment,  emigration, misery, hunger, starvation,
<br />
drug-addiction, modern slavery, sexual abuse of children an women and
<br />
transplantation of organs of people that were condemned to death...) that
<br />
are disrupting the dynamics of the civilization that prevails.
<br />
<p>Learning individually to consistently develop Perspectivism, as a Systems
<br />
Epistemology, as an indispensable first step towards an explicitly
<br />
generalized Wholism (or Holism)  as the (methodological) Way Forward into
<br />
the 21st century. These two concerns could be considered de facto two of
<br />
the main complementary aspects of the General Systems Theory as a procedure
<br />
that aims at prescribing better foresight rather than hindsight. GST used
<br />
for crisis prevention in preference to crisis management: may widen the
<br />
scope of inquiry for asking first whether a certain project, policy or
<br />
action is justified,...
<br />
<p>Ervin Laszlo commented &quot;Thus when von Bertalanffy spoke of Allgemeine
<br />
Systemtheorie it was consistent with his view that he was proposing a new
<br />
perspective, a new way of doing science. It was not directly consistent
<br />
with an interpretation often put on &quot;general system theory,&quot; to wit, that
<br />
it is a (scientific) &quot;theory of general systems.&quot; To criticize it as such
<br />
is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader
<br />
and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now
<br />
know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he
<br />
created a new paradigm for the development of theories.&quot;
<br />
<p>...knowing that GST emerged (as) &quot;an exact doctrine of wholeness as a &quot;pure
<br />
nature science&quot; or &quot;reine naturwissenschaft,&quot; ...a hypothetical-deductive
<br />
system of principles which followed from the definition of the wholeness of
<br />
an organismic (open) system, and led to conceive it, the GST, as &quot;the
<br />
ultimate generalization of the organismic conception&quot; that started in
<br />
Organismic Biology , was followed by an Organismic-systems Psychology
<br />
continued with organismic insights in societal systems and culminated
<br />
assuming possible an organismic model of society and considering necessary
<br />
a GST discipline or science about &quot;principles common to the several levels
<br />
of organization&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;It is necessary to study not only parts and processes in isolation, but
<br />
also to solve the decisive problems found in organization and order
<br />
unifying them, resulting from dynamic interaction of parts, and making the
<br />
behavoir of the parts different when studied in isolation or within the
<br />
whole...&quot; (LvB)
<br />
<p>&quot;General system theory, therefore, is a general science of &quot;wholeness...
<br />
The characteristics of the complex, therefore, appear as &quot;new&quot; or
<br />
&quot;emergent&quot;... (LvB)
<br />
<p><p><p>vii. Peace Research Through GST supported by GSWeltanschauung. Bertalanffy
<br />
noticed  how the human reasoning had become seriously contradictory in the
<br />
way it 'evolved' towards  more degenerated states as it was exerted in a
<br />
large measure for organizing scientifically the warfare (terrestrial, naval
<br />
&amp; aeronautical) and creating technologies for modern weapons (chemical
<br />
substances, biological micro-organisms, nuclear devices &amp; psychological
<br />
information) as it has intended de facto to weaken and to annihilate other
<br />
human beings, those that leaders of elites identify conventionally, as
<br />
irreconcilable enemies.
<br />
<p>He also denounced the behaviorists' declarations of idealism when he
<br />
noticed that the Frederic Skinner's humanitarian motives and his utopian
<br />
world were not moral at all as they were a danger against a real human
<br />
development &quot;...it is more than probable that methods used for
<br />
inconsequential advertising can and will be employed for the deification of
<br />
the state, the nation, its leader, or for global war, as those in charge
<br />
desire. The enormous threat contained in Skinner's latest book is that his
<br />
is not a program or project to undo freedom and dignity but a description
<br />
of what is [already] widely realized in the thought control exerted by the
<br />
mass media, commercial society, and politics&quot;. LvB had previously denounce
<br />
the amoral intentions of Ernest Dichter the dean of motivational research
<br />
and behavioral engineer, who sold advice to corporations on how &quot;to
<br />
manipulate human motivations and desires&quot;. &quot;The motivation research founded
<br />
by Dr. Dichter is developing into a science of mass persuasion [that] can
<br />
make the human animal buy everything and anything, from detergents to
<br />
cigarettes, from cars to American presidents, up to wars and atomic
<br />
self-destruction...&quot; (DAVIDSON, Mark: Uncommon Sense. The Life and Thought
<br />
of Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Father of General Systems Theory. J. P. Tarcher
<br />
Inc, Los Angeles, 1983.)
<br />
<p>The GST approach to Vietnam, according to Bertalanffy would have included
<br />
the primary question of whether or not the U.S. should have made a military
<br />
commitment in Vietnam at all. Today this approach may encourage belligerant
<br />
entities to examine jointly why any  conflict could arise and to explore
<br />
together how to reduce and eliminate the causes of conflicts. (DAVIDSON,
<br />
Mark: Uncommon Sense.)
<br />
<p>In this year 2001, after the tragedy of 11th September when several
<br />
thousands of civil people were killed by suicidal terrorists (quite less
<br />
than those killed in Africa, Latin-america, Asia and Europe  by other kinds
<br />
of terrorism - illegal and even legalized and accepted by many governments)
<br />
it has become once again explicitly evident the advances in the use of mass
<br />
persuasion methodologies  in order to get the support required for
<br />
justifying:
<br />
<p>i) the use of weapons in order to authoritarianly  consolidate the World
<br />
Order that has been conceived and gradually implemented during the second
<br />
half of the last 20th century firstly by means of actions conceived,
<br />
organized and implemented during the postwar period (starting around the
<br />
1950s) which allowed some winners and loosers of the First and Second World
<br />
War, being included several regimes functioning in accordance with the
<br />
modernized capitalist ideology and the former U.S.S.R. presumably
<br />
socialist, to become economically richer by continuously taking advantage
<br />
unilaterally of natural resources located anywhere on the planet. Meanwhile
<br />
the less developed countries became systematically poorer and poorer
<br />
through the imposition of R&amp;D policies. No doubt that some systems
<br />
methodologies have been also conceived and implemented for the benefit of
<br />
the winners of what was de facto the Third World War - an economic one -
<br />
which was not even declared.
<br />
<p>The trends of the prevailing civilization have become during the last
<br />
decade frankly contradictory though they are announced everywhere, through
<br />
a powerful mass media, as the unique possibility of organizing faster
<br />
everything related with the human way of life (transportation,
<br />
communications, data processing, internet since 1995,...). These are
<br />
actions that are announced as drives toward a post- ultra modern
<br />
perspective for the evolvement of the human society, claiming that every
<br />
modern human may and must go - willingly or not - faster and faster
<br />
everywhere , anywhere and nowhere. These tendencies cannot be sustained
<br />
anymore, neither according to traditional procedures and even less
<br />
humanely. But they are basic factors of policies concerned with
<br />
globalization of business, finances and all kinds (legal and illegal) of
<br />
economic transactions, which are announced as if they were the panacea
<br />
needed for pushing ahead the evolvement of the 'civilized way of life'.
<br />
Instead what has arisen is a controversial globalization that has caused
<br />
the emergence of many dissidents who argued that it the Fourth World War -
<br />
an economic and political one - aims, supported ideologically by an inhuman
<br />
neoliberalism, at destroying borders, governments and nationalisms because
<br />
they are not longer necessary. This event soon became the source of a
<br />
generalized globalization of unemployment, criminality, misery,
<br />
corruption,... and also frivolity, hypocrisy,...
<br />
<p>ii) the bombardement of areas inhabited by indigenous people and emigrants
<br />
living in miserable conditions (like those asking today for aid in
<br />
Afghanistan and Pakistan) with  food, portable radios, clothing, water,
<br />
medicines,... for conditioning the reaction of people. After all they can
<br />
learn to behave like intelligent rats or dogs as they are second and third
<br />
class humans willing to accept a bribe in order to change their mood till
<br />
eventually  accept and contribute to consolidate the World Order planned
<br />
for the 3rd millennium
<br />
<p>Instead it seems more humane to learn how to use General Systems Theory as
<br />
an approach to the prevention of wars - military, economic, political and
<br />
cultural ones, knowing that Bertalanffy conceived and developed it as an
<br />
approach for all fields and all kinds of problems,... a systems approach
<br />
for dealing with the disarray and disturbances caused by some
<br />
inconveniencies.
<br />
<p>&quot;In our considerations we started with a general definition of &quot;systems&quot;
<br />
defined as a &quot;set of elements standing in interrelations... No special
<br />
hypothesis or statement were made about the nature of the system, of its
<br />
elements or the relations between them. Nevertheless from this purely
<br />
formal definition of &quot;system&quot; many properties follow which in part are
<br />
expressed in laws well-known in various fields of science, and in part
<br />
concern concepts previously regarded as anthropomorphic, vitalistic. or
<br />
metaphysical. The parallelism of general conceptions or even special laws
<br />
in different fields therefore is a consequence of the fact that those are
<br />
concerned with &quot;systems&quot; and that certain general principles apply to
<br />
systems irrespective of their nature...
<br />
<p>There appear to exist general system laws which apply to any system of a
<br />
particular type, irrespective of the particular properties of the systems
<br />
and the elements involved,... a general theory of systems would be a useful
<br />
tool and providing on the one hand, models that can be used in, and
<br />
transferred to, different fields, and safeguarding, on the other hand, from
<br />
vague analogies which often have marred the progress in these fields.&quot;
<br />
(Ludwig von Bertalanffy).
