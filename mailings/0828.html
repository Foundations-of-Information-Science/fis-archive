<p>
INFORMATION, what for?
<br />
<p>Supported by fossil information it has been claimed that the 
<br />
emergence of our ancestral genus Australopithecus was caused by 
<br />
evolutionary processes that occurred through the survival endeavours 
<br />
of arm-swinging higher primates.
<br />
<p>Some other information obtained also by means of research has obliged 
<br />
to recognize that human characters are less specialized than those of 
<br />
the apes. Therefore it has been argued that the characters of humans 
<br />
were the outcome of evolutionary processes happening through the 
<br />
performance of the Old World monkeys.
<br />
<p>Based on additional data after recalling in humans the absence of a 
<br />
tail, the form of the foot, the presence of a vermiform appendix, the 
<br />
form of the thorax, the retarded growth, the great flexibility of 
<br />
behavior,&#x160; it has been asserted that humans and African apes had a 
<br />
common ancestry. This information suggests that other kind of 
<br />
evolutionary processes led the Hominidae to become the genus Homo 
<br />
around 1.3 million years ago.
<br />
<p>Anyhow the fossil evidence and the various ways diverse data about 
<br />
earlier primates have been interpreted and later arranged (or vice 
<br />
versa) after being speculatively confronted have been considered a 
<br />
successful final outcome of diverse evolutionary processes which 
<br />
rather mysteriously modified and presumably improved the 
<br />
self-organizing possibilities in the domain of the human species. 
<br />
After all, the whole SELF ORGANIZING chances appear as something 
<br />
intrinsic to the functionality of every living being.
<br />
<p>Today, in spite of controversial arguments and even contradictory 
<br />
judgements it cannot be denied that our ancestors who belonged to the 
<br />
Ramapithecus made possible the emergence of the Australopithecus 
<br />
Africanus and its existence from 5.5 to 1.5 million years BP because 
<br />
they learnt through communication of information- though unaware of 
<br />
what they were learning - to develop a certain gregariousness 
<br />
inherited from ancient primates.
<br />
<p>Apparently it has been always this gregariousness what has led the 
<br />
groups of hominids to organize their survival efforts by means of 
<br />
cooperative actions such as gathering, hunting, defense, offense,&#x160; 
<br />
after being conceived as necessary options derived from the way the 
<br />
so called information about the surrounding reality was interpreted 
<br />
while being integrated (or vice versa).
<br />
<p>Anyhow it seems convenient to notice that in those years there were 
<br />
some hominids who managed relatively well the integration of the 
<br />
related information necessarily through oral means.
<br />
<p>It seems indeed to be sufficiently evident that our hominid ancestors 
<br />
managed well to identify more and more and always better some of the 
<br />
causal interactions that were taking place in the surroundings 
<br />
basically because they learnt to communicate among them by means of 
<br />
speech in order to transfer information of questions, subjects or 
<br />
matters and also events and happenings that they had perceived and 
<br />
necessarily interpreted under the influence of diverse cultural bias.
<br />
<p>Since those years all the hominids have been searching how to 
<br />
organize better their individual and collective way of life by means 
<br />
of cooperative endeavors arranged through oral communication among 
<br />
individuals who were increasingly motivated to cooperate.
