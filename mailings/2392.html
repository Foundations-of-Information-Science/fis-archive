                    Subject: Re: [Fis] The Identity of Ethics
                    <br />
                <p>Dear Jerry and all,
                    <br />
                <p>Morality is a (human) fact, not different from, say, the existence of
                    <br />
                    chemical reactions that follow special 'rules'. We say in German that
                    <br />
                    &quot;Chemistry works&quot; (&quot;die Chemie stimmt&quot;) when we spontaneously make
                    <br />
                    friends/make love (See also Goethe's &quot;Wahlverwandschaften&quot;).
                    <br />
                <p>Of course, I am not saying that the specifity of moral imperatives can be
                    <br />
                    deduced from natural phenomena whatsoever. I am just 'justifying' the
                    <br />
                    existence of a specific form of human reflection called ethics that has to
                    <br />
                    do explicitly with the moral phenomenon, i.e. with norms and values that
                    <br />
                    rule human action in a specific community.
                    <br />
                <p>These norms and values can be descriptive analyzed (no different in
                    <br />
                    principle as when you analyze a chemical substance and its reactions with
                    <br />
                    other ones), what we call &quot;descriptive ethics.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>We distinguish it from a &quot;normative ethics&quot; in which we tentatively analize
                    <br />
                    the form and content of such systems of morals in order to justify/change
                    <br />
                    them (or not) and so in order to give ourselves reasons for our actions.
                    <br />
                    That we are able to give ourselves reasons for our actions, i.e. that we do
                    <br />
                    not just act according to &quot;unchangable&quot; laws of nature but that we are open
                    <br />
                    to possibilities of action makes the specificity of human action and its
                    <br />
                    &quot;moral&quot; character.
                    <br />
                <p>In case these possibilities take place within the context of modern digital
                    <br />
                    communication (Internet and the like) we speak of &quot;information ethics&quot;
                    <br />
                    (similarly to &quot;medical ethics&quot; in the case of situations in which the
                    <br />
                    physician/patient/society are involved regarding health). In other words,
                    <br />
                    we ask for an ethical foundation of our decisions within a digital
                    <br />
                    communication environment. But in a broader sense, we can say that
                    <br />
                    'information ethics' deals with norms and values of (human) communication
                    <br />
                    in different media. In this sense we speak for instance of library ethics,
                    <br />
                    (mass) media ethics etc. Of course, the ethics of scientific communication
                    <br />
                    belong to information ethics to, concerning not only, for instance,
                    <br />
                    plagiarism, but the very idea of sharing our (scientific) ideas with others
                    <br />
                    (which include some kind of &quot;communism of ideas&quot; that interferes sometimes
                    <br />
                    with the (moral/legal) rules of, say, copyright regime(s).
                    <br />
                <p>The question you state about the genesis of moral (not ethical!) behavior
                    <br />
                    is a key issue in ethical thinking for centuries (I say: moral behaviour,
                    <br />
                    because this is the phenomenon we want to study, &quot;ethical behavior&quot; being
                    <br />
                    the reflection upon it: the question about the genesis of &quot;ethical
                    <br />
                    behavior&quot; is not (basically) different from the question of any other kind
                    <br />
                    of &quot;scientific behavior&quot;: why do we do science? for pragmatical (survival)
                    <br />
                    purposes? for the seek of truth? ... in the case of ethics as reflection of
                    <br />
                    morality, we start with this kind of reflection whe we have problems with
                    <br />
                    moral rules. Ethics is a symptom. But this is a broad field of study that I
                    <br />
                    cannot deal with now).
                    <br />
                <p>So, what is the genesis of moral behavior? why do we &quot;feel&quot; obliged to do
                    <br />
                    the good? Is this the right question to start with? (as you see I am asking
                    <br />
                    now two different kinds a questions, an ethical and a &quot;metaethical&quot;
                    <br />
                    (linguistic) one). We can start with the &quot;fact&quot; of human will (this is what
                    <br />
                    Kant and Schopenhauer...) do, by saying that reflection (ethics) is not a
                    <br />
                    (enough) motivation for moral action (as intellectualists believe). Kant
                    <br />
                    believed that human reason (seeking vor universal laws) is not only of
                    <br />
                    theoretical but also of practical kind. Given the fact (!) that we are
                    <br />
                    capable of doing science (i.e. of looking for the universal) means, when we
                    <br />
                    reflect it upon our actions, that we are &quot;compelled&quot; to act also
                    <br />
                    &quot;universallistically&quot; which is what Kant calls, as you know, the
                    <br />
                    categorical imperative. How does this idea of universality (or of the
                    <br />
                    formality of the categorical imperative) fits with the &quot;locality&quot; of moral
                    <br />
                    systems/norms and their evolution? and how do we &quot;apply&quot; the Kantian rule
                    <br />
                    to specific situations?
                    <br />
                <p>Today we are maybe less Kantians as we think because our belief in human
                    <br />
                    reason and its universality is not so strong as two centuries ago. We have
                    <br />
                    some good reasons (theoretial and historical ones) for being sceptical
                    <br />
                    about it.
                    <br />
                <p>But not only this, we have in the field of ethics other traditions than
                    <br />
                    Western one which makes us more &quot;humble&quot; with regards to our foundational
                    <br />
                    ambitions. In a way, this is less a negative aspect as a positive one
                    <br />
                    because it shows is the openness of human cultural evolution and the kind
                    <br />
                    of ethical &quot;indeterminacy&quot; of human reason. But why should our action and
                    <br />
                    its foundation be less complex than, say, the life of a molecule?
                    <br />
                <p>Another (older) (Western) tradition of ethics states that the task of
                    <br />
                    ethics is not primarily the fundation of morals but the &quot;design&quot; of good
                    <br />
                    life (ars vitae). What we try to reflect in the information field is the
                    <br />
                    idea (the ideas) of what this means in the beginning century. This kind of
                    <br />
                    ethical thinking is less &quot;normative&quot; and more &quot;optional&quot;.
                    <br />
