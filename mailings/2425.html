<p>
I've enjoyed Viktoras' treatment of morals. There is selfish fitness of 
<br />
an individual and there is the fitness of society. For a long ago have 
<br />
integrated societies won over disintegrated societies.
<br />
<p>Let me now take the stance of a &quot;ruler&quot; of a society: I want those 
<br />
individuals that benefit society to prosper, and I want to get rid of 
<br />
those individuals that do not benefit society. Of course, there are many 
<br />
different situations over a lifetime of a society. Academics at the age 
<br />
of 20 are not yet useful members of a society - they are a bit like 
<br />
children that still have to be nurtured. On the other hand, physical 
<br />
workers at the age of 80 might no longer be as beneficial as they used 
<br />
to be. Soldiers are useful in times of war, but not that useful in times 
<br />
of peace. Artists are not useful in times of war, but are useful in 
<br />
times of peace. Morals define the standards of behavior in a group that 
<br />
assures that society functions well. Diversity is about having degrees 
<br />
of freedom. Diversity is the ability to adapt. But uniformity is about 
<br />
having speed and inertia, the push and the blast.
<br />
<p>Morals can be sustainable or unsustainable. Sustainable morals assure 
<br />
that moral people prosper more than immoral people. Unsustainable morals 
<br />
take moral people and suck them dry, while immoral people prosper. Such 
<br />
a moral system doesn't last for a long time: it drains the pool of moral 
<br />
people.
<br />
<p>Moral people like to be around other moral people. Immoral people thus 
<br />
end up being with other immoral people, and such ghettos of immorality 
<br />
tend to perish, while islands of morality prosper. Of course, there are 
<br />
always immoral individuals that try to invade the islands of morality 
<br />
for their personal selfish gain. Many moral systems tend to take their 
<br />
most moral individuals and throw them into the sea of immorality trying 
<br />
to form a new island. Some of them succeed, and some of them drown.
<br />
<p>Many moral systems thus act in such a self-interested way. Religions try 
<br />
to spread by sending missionaries who try to capture the minds and 
<br />
souls. Democracies try to spread by installing governments around. It's 
<br />
a never-ending process of attempts to take over the world. Some moral 
<br />
systems spread faster, and some don't spread at all. Shakers required 
<br />
everyone to be celibate, so from their peak of 6000 people, there are 
<br />
now 7 women left 
<br />
(<a href="../../religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/Shakers.html">http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/Shakers.html</a>). 
<br />
Christians and Muslims, on the other hand, oppose contraception and 
<br />
abortion in the attempt to fill the world with more Christians and 
<br />
Muslims as quickly as possible. These religions have been most 
<br />
successful in spreading. Yet, Catholicism takes its most moral people 
<br />
and makes them celibate as to speed up the spread of religion. But now 
<br />
it seems to have run out of this non-renewable resource, and it's 
<br />
running out of people willing to be priests. I wonder when will the 
<br />
western democracies run out of another non-renewable resource: 
<br />
civic-minded productive taxpayers.
<br />
<p>Morality is any idea people believe in. Religion is an idea that became 
<br />
aware of itself and that consciously spreads itself around the world. 
<br />
Democracy is a religion. Communism is a religion. Socialism is a 
<br />
religion. Capitalism is a religion.
<br />
<p>Who's winning? Who's losing? Who will prevail? Which religion will 
<br />
dominate in 100, 200 years? Which religion is the fittest? Which 
<br />
religion will transcend this never-ending quest for mindshare? Which 
<br />
religion will survive? Which religion will best adapt to the 
<br />
contemporary reality of worldwide information networks instead of the 
<br />
traditional reality of a network of adjacent villages, where 
<br />
Christianity and Islam were both born. Which religion will be able to 
<br />
maintain and nurture its base of key believers?
<br />
<p>Best regards,
<br />
