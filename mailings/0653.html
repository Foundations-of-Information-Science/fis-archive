Hi James,
<br />
<p>Thanks for your insights.
<br />
<p>&lt;That is why it makes sense to say that a pharmaceutical molecule which imitates
<br />
&lt;an enzyme's natural substrate closely enough to trigger a conformational
<br />
&lt;change via the low-energy interaction at the active site, but is
<br />
&lt;different enough to gum up the works when it comes to the enzyme's
<br />
&lt;high-energy functional action, has in effect &quot;fooled&quot; the enzyme. Here,
<br />
&lt;I believe, we are already seeing the roots of information use.
<br />
<p>I believe this 'fooling interaction' has counterparts in other domains -
<br />
camouflage among flora and fauna, courtship rituals, politicians' 
<br />
sleight-of-hand , poetic license, viral replication etc which are accepted as 
<br />
'true lies' and part of 'living' (surviving and thriving). 
<br />
<p>&lt;In short, one can ban the word &quot;purpose&quot; from the discussion, but one
<br />
&lt;cannot banish the phenomenon itself
<br />
<p>The 'intentionality' can be seen as part and parcel of the informational
<br />
'experience' (Lat experior - 'trying at'). Is the 'purposiveness' of, say 
<br />
ligand/substrate binding expressed as an automatic 'fitness' (this shape only 
<br />
fits that shape) or was the match determined elsewhere? 
<br />
Was it a chance encounter or a match made in heaven?
<br />
Was the poor old enzyme simply 'love's fool'?
<br />
<p>I think it is a similar question to Pedro's about the abduction of energy in
<br />
laughter and blushing - where the blood flow to the cheeks has an informational value
<br />
beyond the original purpose (Juan's 'producing change elsewhere'): 
<br />
<p>'there is a bypass of an unnecessary surge of brain blood related to a 
<br />
cancelled action of escape which is redirected towards the face'
<br />
<p>As with phantom limb pain there is a kind of somatic 'fooling' in
<br />
which the informational 'special effect' (blush, pain) has an
<br />
emergent intentionality apart from the original purpose (cause and effect).
<br />
<p>Do we kinda agree?
<br />

Subject: Reply to Roederer and Holgate
<br />
<p><p>Dear Juan:
<br />
<p>Thanks for the clarifications. We are indeed very close to each other in
<br />
our thinking. I could not agree more with your characterization of the
<br />
problem---to understand how one can get from a purely energetic coupling
<br />
to a coupling that is controlled by the low-energy informational link,
<br />
not the higher-energy interactions occurring at either end of the link,
<br />
or in the space in between. That is indeed the very essence of the
<br />
puzzle, of life and of mind, in my view.
<br />
<p>On the mobilization of stored energy Ho has interesting things to say,
<br />
and on the nature of the low-energy informational &quot;coupling&quot;, Rod
<br />
Swenson and others have written insightfully. But I think it is fair to
<br />
say that no one really understands what to make of the existence of such
<br />
a situation, from a physical point of view. But getting clear on what we
<br />
need to explain is of course a major accomplishment in itself.
<br />
<p>Re: biomolecular examples of this basic type of informational
<br />
&quot;coupling&quot;---what about enzymes? They seem to interact with their
<br />
surrounds via low-energy, noncovalent bonds in a way that is at least
<br />
somewhat analogous to the informational coupling you describe. That is
<br />
why it makes sense to say that a pharmaceutical molecule which imitates
<br />
an enzyme's natural substrate closely enough to trigger a conformational
<br />
change via the low-energy interaction at the active site, but is
<br />
different enough to gum up the works when it comes to the enzyme's
<br />
high-energy functional action, has in effect &quot;fooled&quot; the enzyme. Here,
<br />
I believe, we are already seeing the roots of information use.
<br />
<p>I agree with what you say about the origin of life. As I said, my
<br />
<p><p>Dear John H.:
<br />
<p>When I speak of  &quot;purpose&quot;, I of course imply nothing about any
<br />
subjective experience in the system in question. In general, I try to
<br />
avoid the problem of consciousness (in the sense of qualia) as much as
<br />
possible. (For this reason, I would not like to equate purpose with
<br />
intentionality, at least not without a great deal of discussion.)
<br />
<p>I believe that &quot;purpose&quot; can be given a perfectly objective sense, and
<br />
that it is closely tied to Juan's analysis of an information &quot;coupling&quot;
<br />
that cannot be explained by ordinary physics (although maybe it will be
<br />
some day by an extension of quantum field theory). At any rate, what
<br />
else would you call the goal-seeking behavior of cells?
<br />
<p>In a nutshell, I view purpose (or natural teleology, or intelligent
<br />
agency) as consisting of two aspects, a striving or conative aspect, and
<br />
an instrumental or cognitive aspect. I believe that all living things
<br />
exhibit behavior that is best understood in this way, and that this is
<br />
just an objective fact about the world.  How to explain it is of course
<br />
another matter.
<br />
<p>I think that against a metaphysical backdrop of effective field theories
<br />
and emergent levels as one finds in the discussions of condensed-matter
<br />
physicists like Philip Anderson and Robert Laughlin, we can perhaps
<br />
begin to make sense of purpose in this sense. It is a property of the
<br />
particular form of the organization of matter that we find in the cell,
<br />
as opposed to a mere abstract relation that could in principle be
<br />
&quot;realized&quot; in any form of matter at all. Like Laughlin, Ho, Hans
<br />
Frauenfelder, Gerald Pollack, and others, I believe that the physics of
<br />
proteins and of the ordered-water-protein-phosphate gel must somehow be
<br />
crucial. However, at this point, this is admittedly more an article of
<br />
faith than any sort of a verifiable empirical postulate. But all the
<br />
other alternatives seem to me worse. I guess time will tell.
<br />
<p>In short, one can ban the word &quot;purpose&quot; from the discussion, but one
<br />
cannot banish the phenomenon itself, for it is the very heart of the
<br />
problem we are discussing here at FIS.
