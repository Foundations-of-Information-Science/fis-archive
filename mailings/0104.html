Dear Rafael:
<br />
Dear All:
<br />
<p>Your recent post gets to the heart of the matter.  After, some ten years
<br />
of trans-disciplinary discussions, I am totally persuaded that
<br />
individuals from different disciplines must work extraordinary hard to
<br />
grasp the professional or domain meanings intended by other
<br />
professionals from other disciplines.  This separation has emerged in
<br />
historical terms as Ray as so nicely pointed out.  It is a modern
<br />
phenomenon, identified earlier by C P Snow in the '50s as simply two
<br />
cultures.  Now, we have &quot;N&quot; cultures and no sign of convergence!
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you Ray for your clarification concerning the history of ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with regard to the mutual influences between the biosciences and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engineering/technology. This is, I think, a key question in an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interdisciplinary dialogue, where everyone is having particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena in mind while at the sime time using the same words which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are sometimes analogue, somtimes equivoc and sometimes synonym!
</em><br />
<p>Exactly!  The heart of the problem of communication across boundaries or
<br />
degrees of organization.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the term &quot;energy&quot; in physics, biology, social behavior and
<br />
music!  How are these meanings related to each other?  Are the meanings
<br />
related to one-to-one correspondences or in terms of coherence?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Peter's &quot;Capurro's trilemma&quot;). If a biologist uses the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information in order to grasp a transformation that takes place as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living organism interacts with the 'Umwelt' then he is, I think, in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar (!) situation as a linguist who says, that information is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just meaning, but that it is a given transformation of a cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure (or, hermeneutical speaking, of a pre-understanding).
</em><br />
<p>An good example which finds coherence at higher degrees of organization.
<br />
However, a chemical transformation is precisely defined in terms of the
<br />
atoms and the organizational structures of the molecules.  The equations
<br />
for a chemical transformation, say an oxidation reaction, are written so
<br />
that they generate one-to-one correspondences between the subatomic
<br />
particles (electrons tranferred), atoms and molecules.  
<br />
Thus, the chemical transformation assumes a very exact one - to- one
<br />
correspondence truth function.  At higher degrees of organization
<br />
involving two or more organisms, such as 'Umwelt' interactions or verbal
<br />
exchanges, it is seldom that one-to-one truth functions exist.  (Not
<br />
impossible, but seldom.)   The philosophical notion of coherent truth or
<br />
consistency over the system may be more appropriate.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Information is, in the first case, a difference that makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference (Bateson) 
</em><br />
<p>For example:  A - B = C?   (Where A,B,C are simple natural numbers?)
<br />
I would call this structural distinctions.  This is how we distinguish a
<br />
molecule with one name from a molecule with another name.  Of course,
<br />
these distinctions refer to both the number of atoms in the molecule and
<br />
the organization of the atoms in the molecules - the so-called &quot;graphs&quot;
<br />
of the molecules.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in the second case is a difference that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finds a difference (Luhmann). 
</em><br />
<p>For example:
<br />
<p>A multiplied by B equals D
<br />
and
<br />
A multiplied by C equals E?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;I would call this a functional distinction,( but this is a weaker
<br />
example than the first.)  The process of finding the difference between
<br />
B and C requires a third object, A.
<br />
<p>In both cases information is (following
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Weizsaecker and others) not a quality of something but a quality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something with regard to a (cognitive) structure. This is a triadic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation as underlined by Soeren (and semiotics). 
</em><br />
<p>Could you explain why you feel that this requires a semiotic treatment? 
<br />
Is it really a representational issue?
<br />
<p>This is also what
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kant says when he talks about qualities belonging to things and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualities that refer to a knower who adscribes them to (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualities) of things. Information is, thus, an (our, or, more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally, a structure's) adscription of something (having its given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualities). It is, as E. Oeser puts it, a second order quality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the reason, I think, why we can talk about information (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general) while at the same time having different phenomena in mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and in our hands!).
</em><br />
<p>Is this a modern phenomenon with respect to the evolution of the
<br />
definition of information?   Who knows the earlier linguistic history of
<br />
this term?
<br />
<p>One of the curious things about Shannon's definition of information is
<br />
that it uses three separate mathematical operations: addition,
<br />
multiplication and exponentiation (or log).
<br />
Mathematically,
<br />
&nbsp;multiplication is defined as iteration of addition; and 
<br />
exponentiation is defined as iteration of multiplication.
<br />
<p>In other words, various iterations of various iterations will describe
<br />
lots of things - both within the sciences and within the humanities.
<br />
<p>Finally, from a organizational hierarchy viewpoint, no units are
<br />
assigned the objects.
<br />
Thus, Shannon's definition can be applied to any stationary distribution
<br />
(your &quot;general information&quot;).  Furthermore, since the units are not
<br />
integral to the definition, any phenomenon which can be expressed as a
<br />
stationary distribution can be approximated as &quot;information&quot;.
<br />
<p>Is it unusual that one can give a precise mathematical definition for a
<br />
calculation, and, at the same time, be vague about the meaning of the
<br />
equation?  Shannon's formula achieves this!!
<br />
<p>Regards to All
<br />
Jerry
