                <p>
                    Dear colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro has pointed out a real problem, I think. I have a few words to say
                    <br />
                    on it that may be of some help in sorting out the issues. They derive
                    <br />
                    partly from my trying to make sense of Atlan's use of computational
                    <br />
                    language along with his claim that some biological (biochemical really)
                    <br />
                    stuctures have &quot;inifinite sophistication&quot;. A structure with infinite
                    <br />
                    sophistication cannot be computed from the properties of its
                    <br />
                    components. Sophistication, as far as I can tell, is a measure of
                    <br />
                    computational depth, which depends on the minimal number of
                    <br />
                    computational steps to produce the surface structure from the maximally
                    <br />
                    compressed form (Charles Bennett). Atlan has made the connection, but
                    <br />
                    also noted it is not fully clear as yet, since Bennett's measure is
                    <br />
                    purely in terms of computational steps, and is relative to maximal
                    <br />
                    compression, not components. Cliff Hooker and I noted these problems
                    <br />
                    (before we knew of Atlan's work -- well, I did, but it was presented
                    <br />
                    poorly by one of his students -- see Complexly Organized Dynamical
                    <br />
                    Systems, Open Systems and Information Dynamics, 6 (1999): 241-302. You
                    <br />
                    can find it at
                    <br />
                    <a
                        href="../../www.newcastle.edu.au/centre/casrg/publications/Cods.pdf">http://www.newcastle.edu.au/centre/casrg/publications/Cods.pdf</a>).
                    The
                    <br />
                    question relevant to Pedro's post is why is computation relevant if
                    <br />
                    common biological systems have infinite sophistication, and thus are not
                    <br />
                    effectively computable, even if they have finite complexity?
                    <br />
                <p>Here is my stab at an answer: the notion of mechanical since Goedel and
                    <br />
                    Turing (I would say since Lowenheim-Skolem, since Turing's and Goedel's
                    <br />
                    results are implicit in their theorems) breaks up into to notions,
                    <br />
                    stepwise mechanical and globally mechanical. A globally mechanical
                    <br />
                    system can be represented by an algorithm that halts on all relevant
                    <br />
                    inputs (Knuth algorithm); these are computable globally. The stepwise
                    <br />
                    ones have no global solution that is effectively computable, but are
                    <br />
                    computable locally (to an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy). The
                    <br />
                    difference is similar to that between a Turing machine that halts on all
                    <br />
                    relevant inputs and one that does not. Both are machines, but only the
                    <br />
                    latter corresponds to Rosen's restricted notion of mechanical. So
                    <br />
                    computation theory can help us to understand the difference between
                    <br />
                    things that are stepwise mechanical, and things that are not. Things of
                    <br />
                    infinite sophistication are not globally mechanical. I will say without
                    <br />
                    proving that they correspond to Rosen's systems that have analytical
                    <br />
                    models but no synthetic models. They may still be mechanical in the
                    <br />
                    weaker sense. In fact I have not been able to see how they cannot be
                    <br />
                    mechanical in this way.
                    <br />
                <p>Consequently, there are Turing machines that are mathematically
                    <br />
                    equivalent to systems of infinite sophistication, but they do not halt.
                    <br />
                <p>So you are probably wondering how processes of this sort can occur in
                    <br />
                    finite time. The answer is dissipation. I'll not give the solution here,
                    <br />
                    as my coauthor on another paper just came into the room and asked me how
                    <br />
                    it was going, and I said I was writing something else that was
                    <br />
                    peripherally relevant :-) A case in point is given in my commentary on
                    <br />
                    Ross and Spurrett in Behavioral and Brain Sciences titled Reduction,

                    <br />
                    as well as the BBS site.
                    <br />
                <p>All spontaneously self-organizing systems (see the Collier and Hooker
                    <br />
                    CODS piece) are only locally mechanical. I won't prove that here, but
                    <br />
                    there is a clue in the BBS commentary.

                    </em><br />
                    Dear FISers,
                    <br />
                <p>I was recently asked some short views summarizing the field of
                    <br />
                    biological
                    <br />
                    computation. After several weeks delay, I finally penned a few lines.
                    <br />
                    Maybe
                    <br />
                    someone in the list can find some interest in the very rough reflections
                    <br />
                    below.
                    <br />
                <p>-----------------------
                    <br />
                <p>In my view, there is some trouble in biological computation or
                    <br />
                    bioinformation or whatever name one chooses for the field. One of the
                    <br />
                    main
                    <br />
                    inputs has traditionally come from theoretical biology, even in the 60's
                    <br />
                <p>(e.g., Waddington, Dancoff &amp; Quastler, von Bertalanffy), but mostly in
                    <br />
                    late
                    <br />
                    80's and early 90's, with leading figures such as Michael Conrad and
                    <br />
                    Robert
                    <br />
                    Rosen. They both were very critical on any easy-going marriage between
                    <br />
                    computers and biology. Michael produced a very fine contraposition of
                    <br />
                    computational differences, between living cells and classical computers,
                    <br />
                <p>from the point of view of adaptability. On the other side, the
                    <br />
                    influences
                    <br />
                    from computer fields did crystallize into Artificial Intelligence, and
                    <br />
                    more
                    <br />
                    recently into Artificial Life (Holland, Brooks, Langton, etc.) and
                    <br />
                    perhaps
                    <br />
                    complexity theorists (Kauffman); notwithstanding important differences
                    <br />
                    among these fields , as a whole they never saw any terrible difficulty
                    <br />
                    in
                    <br />
                    the cross-fertilization, or better hybridization, between computers and
                    <br />
                    biology.
                    <br />
                <p>In actuality I think that around &quot;biological computing&quot; there is a very
                    <br />
                    tough problem --that means I am unable to produce any really convincing
                    <br />
                    argument! But the whole point may be that biological microscopic
                    <br />
                    functional
                    <br />
                    elements (say the enzyme, or the nucleic acid stretch) are not amenable
                    <br />
                    to
                    <br />
                    &quot;sufficient&quot; logical description in similar terms to functional
                    <br />
                    components
                    <br />
                    of computers. Structure, functionality, estrategy, etc. are in every
                    <br />
                    respect (and every &quot;level&quot;) non-comparable, and in general
                    <br />
                    non-compatible.
                    <br />
                    The basic functionalist point of separability between hard and software
                    <br />
                    DOES NOT RULE biologically. Of course, in science one can always drop
                    <br />
                    embarrassing elements of distinction... by &quot;disciplinary&quot; fiat. And
                    <br />
                    then
                    <br />
                    produce flamboyant names &quot;artif. intel.&quot;, &quot;artif. life&quot;,
                    &quot;biocomputing&quot;,
                    <br />
                    etc.
                    <br />
                <p>In the fis discussion list I produced several further arguments
                    <br />
                    ( <a href="default.htm">http://fis.icts.sbg.ac.at/mailings/</a> ), in the 2005 discussion on
                    <br />
                    molecular bionetworks.
                    <br />
                <p>Anyhow, thanks for the stimulus to pen these late reflections.

                <p>PS. Jumping from biological complexity to &quot;social complexity&quot;, as we
                    <br />
                    will
                    <br />
                    start discussing in a few weeks (hopefully!), one would expect a
                    <br />
                    serious
                    <br />
                    scientific-foundational problem too. It is the fate of those
                    <br />
                    informational
                    <br />
                    entities, so poorly amenable to formal treatments.
