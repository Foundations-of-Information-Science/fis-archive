Dear Jerry,
<br />
<p>thanks for your kind remarks and thoughts 
<br />
concerning the future development of this
<br />
very fruitful discussion. This experience
<br />
of *creating knowledge* by making accessible
<br />
our different perspectives and pre-understandings 
<br />
on the basis of the digital network is (at least for me)
<br />
prety unique. 
<br />
<p>I have become more and more aware of
<br />
the questions concerning the four concepts you
<br />
mention (communication, information, meaning
<br />
and semiotics) and... nature. One challenge
<br />
being to think coherently these concepts under
<br />
the perspective of the digital. 
<br />
<p>What happens when we trans-form modern mathematical
<br />
(natural) science into a theory (or groups of theories) that
<br />
are based on the concepts you mention? What are we
<br />
able to understand better? What do we *let appear*
<br />
that was not *visible* under our current theories? Is
<br />
this less *violent* (excuse me for using this metaphor)
<br />
as the case of using mathematical
<br />
representations for what is not a number? After
<br />
2.500 years it seems to me that we may not be aware
<br />
of what we habe been doing since the invention of
<br />
numbers and their *use* for understanding nature...
<br />
<p>Communication and information are indeed fascinating
<br />
concepts and we may be coming into business with
<br />
nature (including numbers/structures) as we did it
<br />
some thousands of years ago. What I most like in
<br />
science is patience, no hurry, ruminating and feeling
<br />
free to fight against our own ideas. 
<br />
<p>We are not necessarily *less human* since we have, say, *de-humanized*
<br />
such concepts as work,  energy, or --- information. I consider
<br />
the view of organisms (including ourselves) as 'tele-processors'
<br />
(or signal-processors or message-processors) as most
<br />
challenging and it has been fascinating for me to see/read
<br />
how some members of this group put this question within
<br />
the context of natural processes. If we *go back* to information
<br />
and meaning within the social context  we may be able to
<br />
see better how a signal may entail meaning for a system
<br />
i.e. how a system is able to perceive something AS something
<br />
delimiting it within a horizon of indeterminacy, including the
<br />
perception of the own limits of the system = its death. 
<br />
This gives rise to new sets of problems  to which Pedro 
<br />
has pointed several times. 
<br />
<p>The question of a *general theory of information* is for me 
<br />
the question of how far a post-modern (or *hyper-modern*)
<br />
theory is able to integrate differences without falling into
<br />
reductionism. It should be able to allow a *re-entry* of 
<br />
observed differences (or *pre-understandings*) and to
<br />
create different kinds of *links* and *nodes*. If this is the
<br />
case, then focus groups may be the right way
<br />
to deal with this kind of complexity in future.
<br />
In other words, a general theory of information 
<br />
is only (?) possible as a network of
<br />
information (and communication) theories and of people
<br />
dealing with them and communicating to each other
<br />
their perspectives (or allowing others to tell them how
<br />
they are using a difference that makes a difference)
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rafael:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your response on your views of the self of time was carefully 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; articulated but I remain skeptical.  The abstractions of time and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space and mass are continuous variables, images of our conceptual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domains, as Max Jammer well articulates.  These concepts work 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together in quantitative structures to bring coherence to physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurements.  I remain puzzled on how these concepts relate to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic of chemical or biological processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
&nbsp;Jerry, thanks, I remain skeptical too! Time is such a *fuzzy* concept
<br />
but... it concerns our lives. Under this perspective the symbol 
<br />
*the concept of time* is an oxymoron as much
<br />
as for Kierkegaard *The concept Angst* (Der Begriff Angst). If we
<br />
are (Cyber-)Hegelians we should be aware of this dane too!
<br />
<p>kind regards,
<br />
<p>Rafael
