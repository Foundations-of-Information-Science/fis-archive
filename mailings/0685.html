In reply to John Holgate on abduction:
<br />
<p>J Holgate said:
<br />
&quot;In the medical field abduction (movement of a limb away from the
<br />
median
<br />
plane of the body) has a counterpart in adduction (towards the body).
<br />
How is that connected to the philosophical concept?&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina:
<br />
I think there are certain similarities in the use of the term,
<br />
abduction. What is similar, is the focus on the relation of the motion
<br />
(abduction, adduction) with a median plane. Consider the median plane
<br />
as the force of gravity, a general, all inclusive, mediating force.
<br />
Within semiosis, the gravitational force, that mediating generalizing
<br />
force, can be understood as Peircean Thirdness...the establishment of
<br />
normative habits. So, a force that is active, without the constraints
<br />
of the median plane/gravity/Thirdness - is abduction. I also call this
<br />
action of freedom from Thirdness, 'attraction' - and there are as we
<br />
know, different kinds of attractors. If a force doesn't find
<br />
constraint, ie, doesn't become controlled by the mediation of
<br />
gravity/Thirdness, then the energy/mass potential will rapidly
<br />
dissipate.
<br />
<p><p>J. Holgate said:
<br />
&quot;In philosophy, abduction (from 'apagoge' rather than 'abducere') is
<br />
arguing
<br />
from a minor premiss where the major premiss is given.
<br />
Adduction/abduction
<br />
represents a movement between adducing best evidence (citation) and
<br />
the experiential
<br />
mapping from an accepted 'body' of knowledge (heuristics, instructions
<br />
etc).
<br />
The Oslerian medical model, for example, has operated under this
<br />
paradigm.&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina:
<br />
I don't think that the major premiss is given in abduction. The
<br />
abductive process is a search for a major premiss. My view of the
<br />
minor premiss is that this is a relationship with experienced reality
<br />
(in semiosic terms, it's the Object Relation) and as you note, it's a
<br />
first step, for one begins, in the abductive process, with the minor
<br />
premiss. (A surprising fact is observed). The next step is - how do I
<br />
interpret this experience? You can do so with an already existent
<br />
major premiss (in which case, you are really operating within a
<br />
deductive interaction, for you are not questioning the validity of the
<br />
major premiss)....or...you can come up with a new major premiss.
<br />
That's abduction.
<br />
<p>J. Holgate said:
<br />
The classical movement of induction/deduction (between the general and
<br />
the particular)
<br />
operates in the background of the abductive process. According to
<br />
sociologists
<br />
like Berger and Lukacs abduction (without the dynamic coherence of a
<br />
rational
<br />
dialectic) can lead to 'reification' and its converse anthropomorphism
<br />
(where IMHO McLuhan was
<br />
heading by mechanicising the 'message'). If you accept the 'triadic
<br />
sign' framework
<br />
of semiosis you can avoid that dilemma (just as accepting the doctrine
<br />
of the
<br />
trinity solves the odd theological paradox) but that doesn't cater for
<br />
the
<br />
more pentecostal (Batesonian) view of abduction:
<br />
<p>Edwina:
<br />
Agree with the first sentence. The power of induction, in my view, is
<br />
that it refuses to commit itself to a major premiss. It accepts only
<br />
probable statistical averages as its major premiss, and leaves itself
<br />
open to future change. The problem of induction is that it is
<br />
completely external. None of the three processes (induction,
<br />
deduction, abduction) should operate as isolate.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree with Berger/Lukac's view of abduction; they almost
<br />
sound as if they are denying or are skeptical of, the human capacity
<br />
for reason. Or indeed, the cosmic capacity to develop normative habits
<br />
(major premisses). What they are ignoring is, as you point out, the
<br />
triadic framework, and therefore, the development of
<br />
Thirdness/gravity/normative habits. As with most people in the social
<br />
sciences, they are operating within a Hegelian framework, which is
<br />
most certainly not triadic.
<br />
<p><p><p>&quot;All thought would be totally impossible in a universe in which
<br />
abduction was not expectable.
<br />
. I am concerned with changes in basic epistemology, character, self,
<br />
and so on.
<br />
Any change in our epistemology will involve shifting our whole system
<br />
of abductions.
<br />
We must pass through the threat of that chaos where thought becomes
<br />
impossible.&quot;
<br />
Gregory Bateson (Mind and Nature)
<br />
<p><a href="../../www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html">http://www.elfis.net/elfol3/abdgb.html</a>
<br />
<p>At this point we probably need a tag wrestling match between Bateson
<br />
and Pierce
<br />
and their supporters...
<br />
<p>Edwina: Probably - I have no idea what the above quote from Bateson
<br />
means ie - why does a change in epistemology involve a shift in the
<br />
system of abduction(s)??? And..'thought becomes impossible&quot;? Thought
<br />
is more complex than this scenario; it involves emotions as well as
<br />
symbols.
<br />
<p>J. Holgate:
<br />
&quot;avoiding the Scylla of Shannon/Miller
<br />
communication theory and the Charybdis of McLuhanism. &quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina:
<br />
Nice. I'm not a fan of McLuhan; he was indeed, mechanical.
