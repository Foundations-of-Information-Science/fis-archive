<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>There are so many interesting issues and messages to pay attention that one 
<br />
cannot even cite them. Overall, although important disagreements remain, I 
<br />
reaffirm the impression that a new treatment of the relationship 
<br />
info/entropy looks feasible and closer. A curious observation to make is 
<br />
that in each one of the two sides, the founding fathers of the fields 
<br />
left  a little chin on the shoe that has caused a lot of nuisances later 
<br />
on: entropy as disorder (Boltzmann) and information as a 'flow' (Shannon).
<br />
<p>I will not insist on the former and will add a recent comment from Bennet 
<br />
and Shor (2004) where they respectfully kick (I think) the 'hydraulic 
<br />
metaphor' on information enshrined by Shannon: source, channel, capacity, 
<br />
carrying rate..., and they ultimately aspire to a new &quot;accurate 
<br />
understanding of quantum information as the natural generalization of its 
<br />
classical forebear.&quot; Information as a flow has conflated well with the 
<br />
disorder interpretation and both of them with the mechanistic-reductionist 
<br />
visions (sorry for using these trite terms, I do not demeanor them as such, 
<br />
only when they get loose from the multidisciplinary checks and  balances 
<br />
needed in the knowledge world).  Shannon himself was comfortable within the 
<br />
mechanistic approach to life and mind (I have a quotation somewhere)... I 
<br />
think that Aleks' and Guy's recent postings are somehow close to the info 
<br />
taxonomies problem that need to be adumbrated to try to go beyond the 'flow 
<br />
of items' and the direct probabilistic interpretation that I do not share 
<br />
(in past years there were quite many exchanges about this theme in the fis 
<br />
list, including Stonier, Werner, Igor, Wolfgang, John, myself, etc. 
<br />
---perhaps just for laziness we have not gone now, but presumably we will 
<br />
retake the different information-genera matter on future bioinformation 
<br />
discussions).
<br />
<p>Stan's big narrative also relates to the above. It is an intriguing text 
<br />
(already commented by other parties), but what would happen if it had been 
<br />
constructed the other way around? Starting with info/entropy in the social 
<br />
sustainability problems, then going to the role of science in contemporary 
<br />
society, the cognizing problems of the human subject, the informational 
<br />
arrangements of life, the singularity of biological emergence, inanimate 
<br />
matter, cosmology...  What does one spontaneously say about the sicentific 
<br />
pretensions or credentials of this other narrative, almost having the same 
<br />
ingredients but changing a little the proportions and the emphasis? In 
<br />
particular, implicit prejudices on Information and Entropy have a lot to 
<br />
say respect the contemporary &quot;Disorder of the Sciences&quot; --which undoubtedly 
<br />
has many causes, and to some degree it is a healthy condition ('the 
<br />
constancy of surprise' in multi-scale entropy that Dante Chiavo was 
<br />
postulating for pysiological adaptability). But I am intruding into 
<br />
'consilience' problems that tentatively will be handled in the next fis 
<br />
session.
<br />
<p>To conclude, let me put into English some brief comments from Antonio 
<br />
Garcia (of this list) in defense of Tsallis' entropy versus Boltzmann's and 
<br />
Sannon's. Or better, please, go to Entropy 2000, 2, 172-177, where 
<br />
Sotologongo-Costa, Rodriguez, and Rodgers make a convincing argument on the 
<br />
elegant generalization of the scaling phenomena (power laws!) by using the 
<br />
maximum entropy principle on fragment size distributions in application of 
<br />
Tsallis entropy. Antonio and me have just published a paper in BioSystems 
<br />
(2004, 1-3, pp. 63-71) making some connections of power laws with Karl's 
<br />
multidimensional partitions ---we postulate the existence of a 'partitional 
<br />
canon' in a variety of organizational phenomena: perhaps our naive 
<br />
discovery of Tsallis vigency in the partitional/fragmentational realm.
<br />
<p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
