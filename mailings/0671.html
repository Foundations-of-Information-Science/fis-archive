<p>
This is a brief addendum to some of the concerns posted by Ted
<br />
Goranson, which revolve around the 'conflict' between a systemic
<br />
structure (ie, enabling reasonably stable, normative interactions) and
<br />
the reality of the individual unit (reasonably unstable and mobile).
<br />
How do these seemingly contrary processes both exist and interact? Is
<br />
only one entity real - ie- the individual unit, and the other merely a
<br />
statistical aggregate? Or is the structure real and the individual
<br />
merely a perceived phenomenon?  Or - as many are now saying - are both
<br />
necessary : a long term process of 'normative habits' and the
<br />
short-term informed results of these normative habits, ie, individual
<br />
units of 'informed matter'.
<br />
<p>But you can't have a dyadic process: structure (the long term habits)
<br />
and the individual units. Why not? Because the dyad sets up a
<br />
power-problem, ie, the location of the source of dynamics. Is it in
<br />
the habits, which become privileged and authoritative? Or in the
<br />
individual units, which become either individual deviant 'rogues' or,
<br />
statistical norms, ie, the tyranny of the majority.
<br />
<p>Instead - you must have a triadic process; made up of:  a nodal site
<br />
for incoming energy in a highly excited and mobile plastic state;
<br />
then, a mediate process of normative habits that will transform and
<br />
reorganize this energy within the logistics of those normative codes;
<br />
and...a resultant organized unit-of-information that is organized in a
<br />
coherent manner.  This 'final unit' will then enter into relations
<br />
with other systems...but, its relations will operate in the same
<br />
triadic manner. Its interaction is not Shannon-dyad crisp, but
<br />
triadic. Its first interaction with another system is as a vague
<br />
highly excited energy-sensate data. NOT as Itself, full and complete.
<br />
And, that energy goes through the same triadic interaction, as it is
<br />
'interpreted' by this second system.  This also implies that all the
<br />
various normative habits must have some more cohesive collegiality;
<br />
they can't operate as separate unique 'normative habits' for
<br />
otherwise, no 'bits' , formed by these habits, would be able to
<br />
interact. That is, the grass species would be unable to interact with
<br />
the insect species.
<br />
There have to be multiple levels of information processing..
<br />
<p>So, I don't agree that category theory is the 'way to go'. I consider
<br />
that category theory operates within a dyadic rather than triadic
<br />
framework. It classifies aggregates but it can't deal with the
<br />
deconstruction of discrete units into energy-stimuli, the
<br />
re-organization of that energy-content via a system's normative
<br />
habits', (which system itself is an evolving set of habits)...into an
<br />
'interpreted' discrete unit of energy (the information)....and...the
<br />
repetition of this triadic cycle.
<br />
Category theory, to me, is a strictly externalist descriptive process
<br />
and it can't deal with a dynamic process that deals with processes
<br />
that are both external AND internal.
<br />
<p>May I suggest our web site: SEE - semiosis/evolution/entropy, for a
<br />
view of some of the explorations that are going on in this
<br />
area...ie...a focus on multileveled hierarchies, a focus on complex
<br />
adaptive systems as triadic processes, and a focus on that vital
<br />
interface zone where 'decisions' must be made between gradients of
<br />
energy - ie - between stable habits and local interpretations.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Take a look at SEED, our online journal. And I'm attaching a list of
<br />
the papers that are going up next month.
