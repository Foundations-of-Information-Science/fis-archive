Hi FISers!
<br />
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Is the consciousness just information on a high and a complex level? Is the
<br />
consciousness just a emergent feature of the information? Is information and
<br />
consciousness basically the same thing. So we argue. Read on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I (Sakari Ahvenainen) am a freelance researcher of information and network
<br />
based warfare. I am making my PhD (just started this year) in the Tampere
<br />
University of Technology, in its Institute of Information Management. I and
<br />
my colleague researcher Risto Korhonen have an idea of a &quot;theory&quot; for
<br />
&quot;Evolutionary, networked and systemic information theory, the ENSI- theory&quot;.
<br />
We want to evaluate its basic assumption by introducing it to you. So, its
<br />
this an old idea, a bad idea or an idea to proceed?
<br />
<p>First about the path we have tried. There are different forms of information
<br />
in the universe. First, the human information in his brains and secondly
<br />
outside his brains as a product of his brains (books, letters etc.).
<br />
Thirdly, in the life, in its DNA and cell. Fourthly, in the technology, in a
<br />
computer (also man made, but technological information may have a different
<br />
future than books (etc).
<br />
<p>What unites these different forms of information? They are differences, that
<br />
have a meaning for their systems.
<br />
Brains: The electronic (etc.) activity of the neurons have meaning for the
<br />
brains, we guess (neither of us is a brains researcher)
<br />
Books: Letter and word have meaning for the language (and the people (their
<br />
brains)) involved.
<br />
DNA: The ATCG (adenine, thymine...) have a meaning for the DNA (protein
<br />
coding) and to the cell.
<br />
Technology: Bit or a collections of bits (a machine language instruction)
<br />
have a meaning for the computer.
<br />
<p>The second question is what differences this different forms of information
<br />
have? This will be answered by our &quot;theory&quot;, so we go to the basic
<br />
assumptions of our &quot;theory&quot;:
<br />
<p>Assumption 1 (A1) (cause and effect): There is nothing, that is not caused
<br />
by something.
<br />
<p>Assumption 2 (A2) (multilevel systems) The existence and its systems are
<br />
multilevel systems (and systems of systems and systems of systems of systems...)
<br />
<p>Assumption 3 (A3) (bigger systems): The existence is driven towards bigger
<br />
systems.
<br />
<p>Assumption 4 (A4) (systems are networks): The systems of the existence are
<br />
networks and they are created by parts that have a meaning to their system
<br />
(and by their borders?)
<br />
<p>Assumption 5 (A5) (emergence and complexity): Every new system creates and
<br />
is a new entity to the existence. If the new system is complex enough it
<br />
will create an emergent feature to the existence, that is hard to explain
<br />
through its parts and their connections. (This is actually a result from A4
<br />
(networks), but it is central to understand the new levels of the existence.
<br />
Or central for understanding how hard it is to understand or explain totally
<br />
by science and by reason complex systems. So there is a transformation:
<br />
entity that has (fully) networked, that has reached a new complexity, become
<br />
to an autocatalytical system, is transformed to something totally new, to a
<br />
new phenomenon in the existence)
<br />
<p>Assumption 6 (A6) (information): Information is a difference that has a
<br />
meaning to its system.
<br />
<p>Assumption 7 (A7) (general use): The above assumptions A1 - A6 are applied
<br />
in the evolution as a general feature and as a feature of smaller systems.
<br />
<p><p><p>Some consequences (C's):
<br />
<p>C1. There is multilevel information. Prove: The existence is a multilevel
<br />
system and its subsystems are multilevel (A2). Systems are based on parts
<br />
that have meaning for the system (A4) and information is difference that has
<br />
a meaning for its system (A6). Parts of a system are differences (obvious).
<br />
This means that a part of a system is information for the system. This means
<br />
that systems are information and this information is multilevel if the
<br />
system is multilevel.
<br />
What follows: Information is a relationship (of system's parts and its whole)
<br />
What follows: Part of a system is information for the system.
<br />
What follows: Regarding the man there could be data, information, knowledge,
<br />
understanding and wisdom. If so, it means that wisdom interprets
<br />
understanding, understanding knowledge, knowledge information and
<br />
information data (see C4). Further, if these are the levels of human
<br />
information, they are the information levels of the human brains based on A1
<br />
and that the information processing happens in the brains of the man.
<br />
What follows: There are emergent phenomenons in the multilevel structure of
<br />
information (A5). Ref. Wisdom or transformation from information (from a
<br />
book) to a knowledge of a person. Or the consciousness.
<br />
What follows: Information and matter coexists for each level of systems of
<br />
the matter.
<br />
Ref. also bit, byte, computer machine instruction, subroutines and framework
<br />
of the program.
<br />
<p>C2. The existence is ontologically always the same, a network, but
<br />
phenomenalogically a different phenomenon at different levels of the
<br />
existence. Prove: A4 and A5 (Presented to the researchers also by Rauno
<br />
Kuusisto, although without this particular prove).
<br />
<p>C3. There is no information without a system. Prove: A6. Also, information,
<br />
if existing, is caused by something (A1), so there is no information without
<br />
its causes (its system).
<br />
<p>C4. The structure of the system is interpreting the lower information, the
<br />
parts of the system. Prove: Parts of a system is information for the system
<br />
(C1) and so this information has a meaning, an interpretation, for the
<br />
system (A6). Ref. (1) microprocessor, computer and its hardware, BIOS,
<br />
operating system, (2) hardware of brains, (3) car, (4) organization...
<br />
What follow: To duplicate interpreting information, one has to duplicate the
<br />
structure of the system. Ref. Microprocessor or brains or universe
<br />
What follows: If the information is a difference that has a meaning for the
<br />
system, but is not a structure, it can be duplicated depending on the nature
<br />
of the difference. Ref. a book, a bit or different state of the brains.
<br />
What follows: Information systems are very different because of their
<br />
different information interpreting structure. Ref. brains (networked,
<br />
complex and multilevel structure) or computer (linear, simpler and less
<br />
multilevel structure). And so, information is processed very differently.
<br />
<p>C5. There is information outside human beings. Prove: Information is
<br />
dependant only on a difference (a part) and its meaning for its system (A6),
<br />
so if there is other systems than humans, there is information outside human
<br />
being. And everything consists of its part (obvious, A2 and A4), so there is
<br />
systems outside human being.
<br />
What follows: Information has not to be connected to the self consciousness
<br />
of the man.
<br />
<p>C6. Its is difficult to trace the path from the basic elements (neurons) of
<br />
the human brains to the higher level of the brains and to the abstract
<br />
thinking of the man. Prove (?): This is true, if the process is multilevel
<br />
and every level creates an emergent phenomenon (A5), that is networked and
<br />
still creates a new emergent phenomenon that is networked and so on.
<br />
What follows: To understand human brains better, one has to find the
<br />
emergence path from networked neuron activity to the abstract thinking of
<br />
the man. The transformations from parts to the whole in this path are the
<br />
key to understand the brains.
<br />
<p>C7. Abstract ideas or consciousness, if existing, are caused by something.
<br />
Prove: A1. A guess for a cause? The thinking man? So, is the consciousness
<br />
just an emergent phenomenon of the information at a (very) high level of
<br />
biological (human) information (A5)?
<br />
<p>C8. The thinking man, if existing, is caused by something. Prove: A1. A
<br />
guess for a cause? Mostly his brains?
<br />
<p>C9. The brains of the man, if existing, are caused by something. Prove: A1.
<br />
A guess for a cause? Neurons, matter and energy.
<br />
<p>C10. Matter and energy .... (you go on).
<br />
<p>C11: There is information to be interpreted, interpreting information and
<br />
information that has been interpreted. Prove: If there is a difference that
<br />
has a meaning for the systems, there is information to be interpreted (A6).
<br />
If there is a system, there is interpreting information, the structure of
<br />
the system (C4). If the difference has a meaning, an interpretation, for the
<br />
system, there is interpreted information (A6).
<br />
What follows: There can be multilevel information systems in which the
<br />
output of the lower level is input in the higher level. Ref. computer,
<br />
brains, organization.
<br />
<p>C12: There is or will be higher level of information (consciousness) than
<br />
the man. Prove: A man is at some level of complexity (information system)
<br />
(obvious). The evolution is driven to more complex systems of existence
<br />
(A3). So, at some point, there will be higher level of information
<br />
(consciousness) than a man.
<br />
What follows: Is the internet a base for this process? Does this mean that
<br />
there will be the consciousness of the mankind, that is and acts as an
<br />
emergent feature in the universe? Ref. noosphere and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.
<br />
<p>C13: The size of the information systems of the evolution does increase.
<br />
Prove: Evolution is driven to bigger systems (A3). The new bigger systems
<br />
are new (obvious, also A5). The new bigger system is information (A4, A6).
<br />
So, the maximum size of information systems does increase in the evolution.
<br />
What follows: The information systems of the human being and that of the
<br />
technology are increasing (A7). Ref. internet and The Grid.
<br />
<p>C14: There is no abstract thinking without a man or some higher
<br />
(information) system, that is capable to abstract thinking. Prove: If
<br />
abstract thinking does exist, it is caused by something (A1).  So, there is
<br />
no abstract world of ideas without some cause.
<br />
<p>C15: Information is order, structure of a system, opposite of chaos and
<br />
chance (Ref. Shannon, Wiener). Prove: A6, C4.
<br />
<p>C16: Abstract is based on matter. Prove (?): If there is something abstract,
<br />
it is caused by something (A1). Abstract could be the emergent or multilevel
<br />
emergent feature of the matter, like the abstract thinking of a man.
<br />
<p>C17: There is information that causes something and information that is
<br />
potential to cause something. Prove: Information is a difference that has a
<br />
meaning for its system (A6). Meaning means that it can cause something, but
<br />
does not have to cause anything.
<br />
What follows: Information has an information context, its interpreting
<br />
system and next there have to be an acting context, so that the information
<br />
causes something. The importance of an act. Ref. millions of sperm cell or a
<br />
book, that is not read.
<br />
<p>C18: There is universal information. Prove: The existence is a system that
<br />
has parts (A2, A4). Parts are information, differences for the system, for
<br />
the existence. Also C1, last &quot;What follows&quot;.
<br />
What follows: Laws of the universe.
<br />
<p>C19 Information can be advantageous or disadvantageous. Prove: Information
<br />
is a difference that has a meaning for the system (A6). If the meaning is
<br />
advantageous or disadvantageous it is still a meaning. Ref. A gene that
<br />
makes a person super intelligent  or to an imbecile. In both cases the
<br />
difference in DNA has a meaning for the person.
<br />
<p>C20: There are two kinds of information for a system. Both are differences.
<br />
The first type of information is the parts of the system. The second are
<br />
differences outside the system that have meaning for the system. Prove: Part
<br />
of a system, see C4 If there is outside the system a difference that has a
<br />
meaning for the system, it is information (A6).
<br />
What follows: There is structural, inside, interpreting information and
<br />
input, outside, information, information to be interpreted.
<br />
<p>And last, what are the differences of the information in brains, books,
<br />
cells and computers according to our theory? First, they are different
<br />
systems and have different parts, so their information has different
<br />
&quot;format&quot;. Secondly and more importantly, they have different amounts of
<br />
levels of system and so different amounts of emergent features depending on
<br />
each lower level emergent features.
<br />
<p>And about evolutionary aspect of our theory. Information in the evolution
<br />
has had steps like this:
<br />
1. Information in the laws of the universe (physics, chemistry)
<br />
2. Information in the life: DNA, cell.
<br />
3. Information in man: His brains and his abstract thinking.
<br />
4. Information in the technology: Computers and computer networks.
<br />
5. Higher level information than in the brains of the man. Wait and see!
<br />
<p>Evolution aims to new bigger systems, so to new levels of information.
<br />
<p>As an information and network (based warfare) researchers, we believe in
<br />
co-operation and distribution of information. So we challenge you to develop
<br />
or to crush our &quot;theory&quot;. An old idea, a bad idea, or idea to proceed?
<br />
