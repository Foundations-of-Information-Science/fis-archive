Dear Rafael
<br />
<p>You write
<br />
<p>&quot;I think Luhmann's difference between 
<br />
_Mitteilung_ (communication) and _Information_  (and _Verstehen_
<br />
understanding) is a useful paradigm. We have being dealing with with
<br />
problem of understanding (hermeneutics) of 'Information' but not being
<br />
much aware that there must be something like an offert (_Mitteilung_)
<br />
out of which the system can create a new understanding.&quot;
<br />
<p><p>I agree that it is fruitful to say that a series of sign will have a
<br />
quantitative aspect(of information in Shannon's understanding), a
<br />
meaning aspect (phenomenological, hermeneutical) and a communicative
<br />
aspect (intentions). But they are always interrelated but often in new
<br />
and interesting ways. For instance if you repeat the same message, then
<br />
the information content is the same but the meaning may change and there
<br />
might be a different communicative intent behind.
<br />
<p>You further write:
<br />
<p>&quot;This is the point where I see the concept of information understood as
<br />
the _causa formalis_. I think  that modern science disregard this sort
<br />
of causality taking into account only the _causa efficiens_ . The _causa
<br />
formalis_ allows only a relative prognose, as I do not know exactly what
<br />
the effect of the  'in-formation' processes will be.&quot;
<br />
<p>This is a very difficult question in science. David Bohm has worked with
<br />
the concept of informational field in his attempt to provide a new
<br />
foundation for the explanation of  quantum entanglements. On semiotic
<br />
and linguistic level in living and social beings information no doubt
<br />
has causal effects also indirect as context/language game
<br />
(Wittgentstein)/ idealized cognitive model (Lakoff)/ground (Peirce). I
<br />
have discussed aspects of this in a paper forthcoming in Evolution and
<br />
Cognition (journal of the Konrad Lorenz inst.) which I will recommend
<br />
here.
<br />
<p>You go on somewhere else, I think it was in the answer to Koichiro:
<br />
<p>&quot;Ancient Greek philosophy (Plato, Aristotle) considered forms 
<br />
(eidos, idea) as the culmination (or realization, _energeia_) of 
<br />
potential being (_dynamis_). The question is, as Heidegger in _Being and
<br />
Time_ states, whether potentiality is 'higher' than actuality. In this
<br />
case forms or not a culmination but a kind of horizon of possible
<br />
developments (not just, as Plato thought, a copy of an eternal
<br />
original).&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;we see now, under an evolutionary perspective, that there are no such a
<br />
priori structures and that 'forms' are perspectives of world 
<br />
constructions (possibilities more than actualities).&quot;
<br />
<p>Again I must point out how close this is to C.S. Peirce's theory of
<br />
evolution and semiotics. Firstness - which can only be known through
<br />
secondness and thirdness - is seen as potentiality and qualities that
<br />
can turn into manifest habits such as  regularities in nature and in
<br />
human understanding. I support this idea.
<br />
<p>I think that this will be the end of the philosophical discussions on
<br />
this list for a while until Pedro opens  a section of the conference on
<br />
this subject again later on as he has just promised. I want to thank
<br />
everybody. It was a great delight . I wish you all a merry Xmas and a
<br />
very happy new year.
