<p>
Juan:
<br />
<p>In responding to your request for feedback on your article, I would like
<br />
to stress that our viewpoints are very similar. In general, I am very
<br />
enthusiastic about your paper. If I stress some (relatively) minor
<br />
differences between us, it is only because that is more interesting than
<br />
discussing points of agreement!
<br />
<p>I am in basic agreement with you when you write that &quot;in a natural
<br />
system we cannot have 'information alone,' detached from any interaction
<br />
process past, present, or future: information is always there for a
<br />
purpose . . .structural order alone does not represent
<br />
information---information appears only when structural order leads to
<br />
specific change elsewhere . . .&quot;
<br />
<p>However, I would like to make the two following observations:
<br />
<p>(1) You seem to be saying that all pragmatic information use is
<br />
communication. Here I disagree. I think we have to allow for a single
<br />
organism interacting with the inorganic part of its environment as being
<br />
an instance of genuine information use, as well. In my work, this is the
<br />
interaction I have focused on. It seems to me that &quot;communication&quot;
<br />
between two organisms is derivative of this more basic kind of
<br />
interaction. (There is the further problem of whether every interaction
<br />
between two organisms should count as &quot;communication&quot;---even a
<br />
predator-prey interaction---or whether &quot;communication&quot; should be
<br />
restricted to cases where one organism is hoping to be &quot;understood&quot; by
<br />
the other. In the predator-prey case, obviously information is
<br />
&quot;transmitted&quot; in some sense[unless deception is perfect], but not in the
<br />
same sense, I think, as in case of communication aimed specifically at
<br />
adjusting behavior.)
<br />
<p>(2) Our pan-informationist colleagues are not going to easily agree with
<br />
us that &quot;in a natural system we cannot have 'information alone'&quot; unless
<br />
we can produce an analysis showing how their version of information as a
<br />
fundamental constituent of the universe on an ontological par with
<br />
matter and energy can be reinterpreted in the light of the
<br />
bio-interactionist model.
<br />
<p>Maybe we need to lay it out like this. There are two kinds of cases to
<br />
consider:
<br />
<p>A - some inorganic structure
<br />
<p>B, C - organisms
<br />
<p><p>So, the question of the locus of information must be posed for each of
<br />
the following four different cases:
<br />
<p>monadic:
<br />
<p>(A) inorganic, intrinsic
<br />
<p>(B) organic, intrinsic
<br />
<p><p>dyadic:
<br />
<p>(B-A) organic-inorganic interaction
<br />
<p>(B-C) organic-organic interaction
<br />
<p><p>In regard to my first remark above, I simply want to emphasize that the
<br />
dyadic relation (B-A) represents pragmatic information use just as much
<br />
as (B-C) does. Indeed, I feel it is the more basic kind of interaction.
<br />
I am not sure whether you will agree with me about this point, or not.
<br />
<p>In regard to my second remark above, most here at FIS want to say that
<br />
(A) embodies intrinsic information, while you and I (and Pedro and
<br />
Jerry, I think) want to deny it. How can we clarify the point at issue
<br />
between the pan-informationists and the bio-informationists?
<br />
<p>Well, we all agree that (B) embodies information. What I think is going
<br />
on is that there is an unspoken belief on the part of many that at
<br />
bottom there can be no difference (or no difference that really matters)
<br />
between (A) and (B).  That is, an organism is viewed by most scientists
<br />
as having no irreducible properties, as being nothing more than the sum
<br />
of its parts. To deny this is viewed as &quot;vitalism,&quot; which is beyond the
<br />
pale.  Now, I think that this reflects a mistaken view of
<br />
ontology---basically, a bill of goods that has been sold to the rest of
<br />
us by the high-energy physicists. The condensed-matter physicists mostly
<br />
do not agree. That is one problem with pan-informationism. But there is
<br />
another factor contributing to the confusion that we bio-informationists
<br />
must also address.
<br />
<p>There is nothing wrong with speaking about the &quot;information content&quot; of
<br />
inorganic systems, so long as we remember that in doing so, we speak as
<br />
human beings looking out on the world.  As such, we are instantiating
<br />
the relation (B-A).  It is when we abstract away from the relation (B-A)
<br />
and claim that information exists already in the monadic relation (A)
<br />
that we err.  I have tried to highlight this problem by introducing the
<br />
following terminology:
<br />
<p>Call the kind of use of information instantiated in the dyadic relation
<br />
(B-A) &quot;autotelic&quot; information. It is information ABOUT the world FOR an
<br />
organism.  But now, if we want to focus on (A) itself, what can we say?
<br />
Well, insofar as it is a part of the dyadic relation, I guess we must
<br />
allow that there is &quot;information&quot; in A, so long as we always remember
<br />
that it is information ABOUT A and not FOR A.  I have coined the term
<br />
&quot;allotelic&quot; to describe information in this special sense---information
<br />
about one system for the purposes of a second system.
<br />
<p>Now, with these definitions in hand, and looking back at the monadic
<br />
relations, I will say that there is no information at all in (A) before
<br />
the origin of life, and after the origin of life, there is only
<br />
allotelic information. Information in the intrinsic or autotelic sense
<br />
is restricted to (B), and simply did not exist before organisms came
<br />
into existence. I'm thinking that this distinction may possibly help to
<br />
bridge the gap between the pan-informationists and the
<br />
bio-informationists, although there still remains the question of the
<br />
utility of speaking of allotelic information abstracted away from the
<br />
dyadic relation (B-A). There may be perfectly good reasons why we will
<br />
want to speak about allotelic information, but we must tread very
<br />
carefully here. If we are not careful, we may end up building the human
<br />
observer into the very foundation of existence, thus landing in the
<br />
cul-de-sac of idealism. It is the dyadic relation (B-A) (understood as a
<br />
special kind of dynamical interaction) that constitutes the ontological
<br />
ground of information in the universe, in my judgment, and we forget
<br />
this fact at our intellectual peril.
<br />
<p><p>John and Norbert:
<br />
<p>Certainly, it is no accident that the Shannon equation takes the same
<br />
form as the Boltzmann equation. After all, one might say that what
<br />
Shannon was doing was analyzing the statistical mechanics of
<br />
communication channels. But that does not mean that information and
<br />
thermodynamic entropy are the same thing.  After all, it is no accident
<br />
that the equations describing electromagnetic and mechanical waves have
<br />
the same form, either. They are both WAVES.
<br />
<p>But just as light and water differ in many other respects, so too do
<br />
information and thermodynamic entropy.  The main way they differ is that
<br />
information is intrinsically MEANINGFUL for some cognitive agent. To use
<br />
the word &quot;information&quot; in a way that neglects its meaning is to misuse
<br />
words, in my view, and to sow confusion.
<br />
<p>Meaning is the heart of the matter. Or, more precisely, the VALUE that
<br />
structures have for cognitive agents in light of their goals is the
<br />
essence of information. So, value is the heart of the matter.
<br />
Naturalizing value---explaining how purpose and meaning can come into
<br />
existence out of a physical universe that is just minimizing
<br />
energy---that is the crux of our problem.  And conflating information
<br />
and thermodynamic entropy merely sweeps this crucial problem under the
<br />
rug. It does nothing to help solve it.
<br />
