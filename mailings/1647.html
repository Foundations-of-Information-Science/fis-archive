Commenting on the apparent conflict between the principles of &quot;least 
<br />
effort&quot; and &quot;least action&quot;:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;SS: So, do you mean the physical principle of least action?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;V.: No. It is from Cybernetics. The principle of the least effort 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says: &quot;a system will try to adapt to its environment or will try to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change the environment to suit its needs, whichever is easier&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (dictionary of Cybernetics and Systems at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="../../pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/INDEXASC.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/INDEXASC.html</a>).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Now let me translate your question 'how does &quot;data to being plotted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;power laws suggest systematicity&quot; ?' to 'how can the principle of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;least effort relate with systematicity in terms of structure of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;?' Possible answer... Systems evolve or grow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;SS: Not by least effort! They strive mightily to grow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; V.: Let me disagree. Let's compare for example life and an explosion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, both from a chemical point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view are oxidation processes. Life is an example 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of oxidation processes controlled by a complex well organized system. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meanwhile the explosive oxidation of free hydrogen is much more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mighty...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;they respond to changes in their environment, they have to optimize 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;structure and performance for optimal functioning (being a structural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of other systems), or in other words systems communicate with their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;environment. Something that is 'not a system' does not 'care' about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;optimization of it's performance, growth, development, adaptation, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;sort of evolution, energy saving (principle of least efforts)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;SS: I would like to hear this principle stated in words explicitly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In general there is no &quot;energy saving&quot; in natural systems. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissipate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;energy gradients as fast as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; V.: I would not agree again... The definition of the principle of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least effort and the comparison of controlled vs. uncontrolled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oxidation look like saying the opposite. The later dissipate energy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gradients much faster comparing with much more complex living systems. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One could also think of difference between controlled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuclear breakdown in power-stations vs. uncontrolled blast if to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember our own creations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;or structural change simply because of the absence of any internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;organization or structure or feedback loop between the 'non-system' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;'random system' and it's environment. Its history should be uniform: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;changes in structure, no development, no growth, no evolution, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;function, no communication - no need for the least effort... As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;consequence a structure of any system facing the entropy should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;organized in such a way as to oppose the II-nd law and optimize its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;performance against energy losses - e.g. the principle of least effort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that is true for language also works elsewhere (any other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; SS: I disagree with this supposed &quot;least effort&quot; Least action would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have nothing to do with it. It is the smallest integral over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; velocity, mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and path length. From that you cannot derive energy efficiency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  V.: May principles of Cybernetics be incompatible with laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physics or vice versa ? I would not like to think this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an unsolvable &quot;conflict&quot; between those two domains of science. On the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other hand I would doubt that physics alone is capable or has all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means to explain what is system, complexity, information, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication, life...
</em><br />
<p>I suspect that Stan and Viktoras are looking at systems from different 
<br />
viewpoints, which is generating the apparent conflict.  Stan is 
<br />
focusing on the striving of self-organization driven by opportunity to 
<br />
channel flows across gradients, while Viktoras is focusing on the 
<br />
structural solutions adopted by systems to the challenge of flows.  In 
<br />
this light, I find myself agreeing with both views.  Systems do indeed 
<br />
strive &quot;mightily&quot; to self-organize and break down gradients, but they 
<br />
do so given the constraints of their circumstances.  Flows, and 
<br />
dynamical systems themselves, are always searching for and pushing up 
<br />
against sources of resistance.  Resistance is either gradually 
<br />
overcome, or adapted to.  Explosions are like potential systems that 
<br />
tear through frictional resistance as they grow; but failing to sense 
<br />
and respond to sources of resistance in the process dooms an explosion 
<br />
to a rapid extinction.
<br />
<p>The principle of least effort makes good sense to me because flows 
<br />
always tend to take the path of least resistance.  This makes natural 
<br />
machines relatively efficient.  On the other hand, these same systems 
<br />
are under constant pressure to serve the thermodynamic imperative 
<br />
(&quot;final cause&quot; sensu Stan) by breaking down external gradients.  I see 
<br />
plenty of room to balance these demands.  A system only needs to break 
<br />
down external gradients fast enough to pay the thermodynamic cost of 
<br />
its continued existence (maintenance, growth, reproduction, ...).  Any 
<br />
extra gradient-breaking would be thermodynamic &quot;icing on the cake.&quot;  I 
<br />
could build a fire tonight, but it won't help with my survival or 
<br />
functioning one bit.  It's like tipping the black jack dealer in a 
<br />
casino (note that I live in Reno).  Systems also only need to be 
<br />
efficient enough to make sure that the rate of fuel input is adequate 
<br />
to pay the costs of existence.  Excess fuel intake allows a system to 
<br />
generate internal resistances to flow that can be used for the 
<br />
extraction of free energy (I am thinking of highly complex biological 
<br />
organisms here).  Even then, however, flows will take the path of least 
<br />
resistance, given the obstacles erected by the system.
<br />
<p>In sum, it seems to me that systems evolve to be as efficient as they 
<br />
can be, given both external and internal (engineered) sources of 
<br />
resistance.  This is the principle of least effort.  At the same time, 
<br />
the efforts they do make are ultimately aimed at channeling flows 
<br />
across gradients.  This often does not look like effort directed at 
<br />
achieving an externally driven goal because they are paid for their 
<br />
efforts in the form of free energy with which they express constrained 
<br />
striving.
<br />
<p>My 2 cents,
