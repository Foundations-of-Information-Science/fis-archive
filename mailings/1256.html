Dear Pedro, all,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Just my very subjective speculations on the topic...
<br />
&nbsp;Indeed, I very much agree to your notice that the levels we are discussing
<br />
here about (may) only partially belong to levels that do exist in nature
<br />
because limitations in our knowledge. On the other hand I tend to share
<br />
Pavel's suggestion - theory of levels is inevitable...
<br />
Probably many of us have been smashing into the disciplinary systems vs.
<br />
reality 'incompatibility'  while trying to develop something about levels.
<br />
My own version (still incomplete after 4 years work) looks more like a 2D
<br />
table rather then a 1-dimensional list... Theory of catastrophes might
<br />
provide a formal background for us and to help distinguishing the real, as
<br />
you wrote, 'joints' of nature. In ecology (that's my field) there is a
<br />
relatively simple method to define hierarchical dependencies of species
<br />
groups (dominants, subdominants, etc...) within given assemblage of species
<br />
(in a sample) which we tend to interpret as directly related to community
<br />
structure. Difference between biomass or number of individuals starting from
<br />
the most abundant and ending with the least abundant species changes not
<br />
continuously, but in a jumpy manner. There are small jumps and big leaps...
<br />
So these leaps naturally group species into groups based on their relations
<br />
and role in an ecosystem. This approach is used in ecology since the
<br />
beginning of the XX century, so there is nothing new in it, except that the
<br />
theory of catastrophes is somehow &quot;out of reach&quot; among ecologists. The same
<br />
can be said about various environmental gradients (e.g. salinity,
<br />
temperature, granularity gradients) - they are never continuous. At smaller
<br />
scale they always occur in jumps. Seems like discontinuity rules everywhere.
<br />
. It reminds me a definition of information as 'difference that makes
<br />
difference. One may see that difference as a 'meaningful discontinuity'. Now
<br />
if we take jumps of scales (sizes) of all known systems, we will see that
<br />
they occur periodically when referenced to log (levels of scale). So this
<br />
was a good point to start. Symmetry of relative scales is an interesting
<br />
point here and also the symmetry in relative energy amounts needed to
<br />
disintegrate those systems shows up...
<br />
The next point in favor of the levels might be comparisons and alternatives
<br />
of neighboring levels noticed by the specialists in these fields. Particle
<br />
physicists frequently notice that interactions among elementary particles
<br />
reminds interactions among chemical atoms. Ecologists know that response to
<br />
stress of an ecosystem is in principle similar to stress handling at a level
<br />
of an organism. And so on...
<br />
But there are weak points in current definitions of what an ecosystem and
<br />
community are. This 'discontinuity filter' (as described above) seems to 
<br />
require several levels of ecosystems and communities, which today remain
<br />
still unnamed. And the very definitions still hides some uncertainties
<br />
within... I guess the similar problems should appear in social sciences.
<br />
Ecologists sometimes try to describe systems of human individuals and their
<br />
interactions as cases of ecological populations or communities... No wonder
<br />
- even cities or towns with they suburbs are called urban ecosystems.
<br />
Natural biotopes here are supplemented by technology (incl architecture).
<br />
Seems like social/eco systems are at the same level...
<br />
********
<br />
Answering the question What is the meaning in the most simple and general
<br />
way ?
<br />
I would keep on the simplest definition of information as above - 
<br />
meaningful discontinuity'. Valid for both differences/changes in space
<br />
(structure) and in time (signal)...
<br />
Signal (as a 'word') is meaningful when it is in it's context. Without the
<br />
context it is just a noise. So when one considers structure (as a system)
<br />
then based on the hierarchies theory (the case of nested hierarchies) system
<br />
is meaningful only as a part of yet another system (context)... This
<br />
directly relates to the purpose of this system which is a certain function
<br />
(role) within a system it makes a part of... Examples: stomach and
<br />
intestinal tract has to handle all the stuff we take in, but can never be a
<br />
replacement for brains; electrons - not neutrons- are responsible for
<br />
chemical interactions among chemical elements; mitochondria are responsible
<br />
for energy supply within a cell and not the chromosomes; population of
<br />
carnivores can not be replaced by a population of deposit feeders,
<br />
communities of plants, algae as elements of their ecosystems produce oxygen
<br />
which is required for the existence of animals (not vice versa) thus
<br />
supporting  energy/matter/information cycles within ecosystems; ecosystems
<br />
have their meaning in the context of biomes, those are important for
<br />
biosphere which wouldn't not be possible without the existence of a
<br />
geosphere and hydrosphere, etc.... So it seems that the meaning in the most
<br />
simple and general way simply (?!.) is a function (role) of a system as an
<br />
element... 
<br />
&nbsp;Are there any systems without a purpose (meaning) ? Maybe not... Because if
<br />
system stops functioning properly (looses it's meaning) it probably becomes
<br />
a 'mortal bucket :-)' and dies disintegrated by a 'higher' system as a
<br />
useless element because the 'higher' controlling system tends to minimize
<br />
amount of energy needed for its own existence.  Otherwise useless elements
<br />
exhaust and kill the entire system parts of which they are as each element
<br />
is also an additional source of entropy, especially when it is useless :o)..
<br />
&nbsp;Systems have mechanisms to handle the internal entropy probably by
<br />
transporting and releasing it into yet another higher level of the hierarchy
<br />
..Thus systems that do nothing (no meaning) or do wrongly (out of context)
<br />
should not exist as their existence is not supported by the top hierarchy.
<br />
In any case loosing the meaning == death of a system.
<br />
Alternatively meaning could be considered as events (discontinuities)
<br />
happening in space among systems (as elements) which lets these elements to
<br />
function in sync. Thus meaning - source of synchronized actions of all
<br />
elements within a system (structure). Meaning does not let the system to
<br />
fall apart. Just my subjective opinion...
<br />
