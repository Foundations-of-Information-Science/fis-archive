                <p>
                    Dear Andrei and colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>I think we together have found out that the realist's and anti-realist's
                    <br />
                    systems are both plain believe systems. If you plead for either of them you
                    <br />
                    are bound to embrace realism or anti-realism by personal belief since
                    <br />
                    science cannot in principle device an experimental procedure to come to such
                    <br />
                    a decision in that matter. In that respect it sounds that also this very
                    <br />
                    controversy is undecidable - but not so. What we have missed evidently is to
                    <br />
                    emphasize that a mature science cannot house answers to questions that are
                    <br />
                    undecidable without degenerating to a framework of plain speculations. Since
                    <br />
                    the realist/antirealist controversy is undecidable the very question &quot;Is
                    <br />
                    reality real?&quot; unfortunately juxtaposes to another famous question &quot;Is there
                    <br />
                    a God?&quot; and both must by necessity be answered by reference to subjective
                    <br />
                    belief - even if consensual (i.e., that the majority believes in a real
                    <br />
                    reality or a God). A mature science, however, must be able to forcefully
                    <br />
                    reject undecidable questions - but today's science does not! This very point
                    <br />
                    has passed almost unnoticed. Most literature on philosophy is lousy with
                    <br />
                    questions that are undecidable - however this does not seem to prevent the
                    <br />
                    author to present answers - on the contrary - they generally supply answers
                    <br />
                    en masse. However in this situation any answer is as bad a candidate as
                    <br />
                    another - since the mistake is to try to provide an answer to an undecidable
                    <br />
                    question.
                    <br />
                <p>This has little to do with philosophy. The problem lies in the fundamental
                    <br />
                    assumptions underlying science. Since the real/unreal question is
                    <br />
                    undecidable a real/unreal distinction is strictly forbidden and therefore
                    <br />
                    also the ordinary outside/inside distinction as made by the cognitive
                    <br />
                    sciences. One of the fundamental definitions of classical science is that
                    <br />
                    there is a real (and furthermore unary) world that is well separated from
                    <br />
                    human knowledge - and here the mentioned forbidden distinction deceitfully
                    <br />
                    appears. If we accept this misleading situation we can discuss the
                    <br />
                    real/illusory question for centuries (as mankind already have done) but no
                    <br />
                    answer will come out because there simply is none. To my mind the now almost
                    <br />
                    closed FIS discussion was just another iteration of this fruitless
                    <br />
                    discourse - unfortunately.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>A physicist would never dare to use an instrument he doesn't understand -
                    <br />
                    however the very same physicist can without precautions make use of his
                    <br />
                    perceptual instrument without even a rudimentary understanding of its
                    <br />
                    function. Isn't it strange? The clue to the present confused situation of
                    <br />
                    science is to ask how it is possible for an observer to make a model of any
                    <br />
                    phenomenon - if he has not a model of its own mind at his disposal, exactly
                    <br />
                    in the same way we require a model of an instrument to understand its
                    <br />
                    function. The realist's dilemma was an attempt to highlight this very
                    <br />
                    situation, but unfortunately nobody tried an answer or even challenged the
                    <br />
                    dilemma as formulated. An observer lacking of a model of its own perception
                    <br />
                    cannot model anything else but its own experience - exactly in the same way
                    <br />
                    a physicist using an unknown instrument cannot make sound decisions. This
                    <br />
                    very conclusion disqualifies the scientific observer to make certain
                    <br />
                    inference - and also to use the celebrated experimental methodology as a
                    <br />
                    crisp decision tool. In this situation we must resort to human consensus and
                    <br />
                    a science based on social constructs.
                    <br />
                <p>When the real/unreal distinction is forbidden also the real/mental
                    <br />
                    distinction is forbidden and useless as well, as R. Rorty clearly points out
                    <br />
                    in his book The Mirror of Nature. However the problem here is not to decide
                    <br />
                    as to whether the world is real or not - what is required is to understand
                    <br />
                    that this very question is undecidable by experimental means and should not
                    <br />
                    be asked at all for that reason. This is a point of view I have been arguing
                    <br />
                    for - evidently in vain. This finding only invalidate experiment as a
                    <br />
                    decision tool - and what is left then is to make a personal decision on that
                    <br />
                    matter (formulate a belief). This is also science - but not classical
                    <br />
                    science based on the outcome of physical experiments but rather a science
                    <br />
                    based on human consensus.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Returning to the fundaments of science we can of course ad hoc define two
                    <br />
                    different domains; one real and another mental and then keep yourself busy
                    <br />
                    the whole life debating this question - and this debate has been on the
                    <br />
                    agenda since the dawn of science. No surprise since it is undecidable within
                    <br />
                    the classical framework. This is why science must abort undecidable
                    <br />
                    questions from its discourse. Not only the real/unreal question - but a row
                    <br />
                    of other questions like e.g.: &quot;What is matter?&quot; By the way what kind of an
                    <br />
                    answer do we expect? The real/unreal controversy (not the question) is
                    <br />
                    solved when we start evaluate what sort of questions we are allowed to pose
                    <br />
                    to the models we make use of in science. In future though we cannot go on
                    <br />
                    pretending we are in the possession of answers of questions that are
                    <br />
                    undecidable in principle. When doing so we act like priest pretending to
                    <br />
                    have access to God's point of view.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>You have done a great job Andrei and I consider you a very brave scientist
                    <br />
                    by the very way you straightforwardly in detail present your ideas - but
                    <br />
                    sometimes I cannot make sense of your saying. You say we cannot
                    <br />
                    &lt;&lt;understand&gt;&gt; reality and still you claim it to be &quot;real&quot; ???? You say
                    <br />
                    &quot;information is not less real than mass or charge&quot; Not a misleading
                    <br />
                    statement - but it lacks of useful meaning. It just begs the question: &quot;What
                    <br />
                    is real?&quot; - indeed a forbidden question since there is no answer.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Neither I can I agree with you and Søren Brier that the main problem is that
                    <br />
                    in modern science information is always reduced to probability. I think the
                    <br />
                    opposite is the problem; Namely that scientists once came to believe that
                    <br />
                    certain immutable answers are possible. There are no such answers - they are
                    <br />
                    all more or less probable - and therefore reduces to probability calculus.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Evidently not even you are satisfied with your point of view since you
                    <br />
                    finally conclude&quot; there should be done something cardinally new...&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>well - since scientific dualism evidently is misleading I have argued for
                    <br />
                    scientific monism in the guise of the Subject-Oriented Approach to Knowing .
                    <br />
                    this is something cardinally new...
                    <br />
                <p>I am afraid I was neither clear nor very successful in this deed.. but I'll
                    <br />
                    find comfort in the saying that people sometimes do not even recognise the
                    <br />
                    path towards home when they see it.
