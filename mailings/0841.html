<p>
The dynamics of civilization has become determined de facto by the 
<br />
discovery made by some privileged brains who have managed to observe 
<br />
the surrounding reality with the intention of making today use and 
<br />
tomorrow better use of natural things and phenomena. Along millennia 
<br />
several enlightened humans have been able to identify one after 
<br />
another more and more aspects of the whole causality that has 
<br />
determined the natural environments where humans were first learning 
<br />
to settle down - taking into account the increasing knowledge they 
<br />
had about the natural circumstances. But pretty soon afterwards most 
<br />
humans in every settlement constituted were obliged to learn how to 
<br />
behave more and more restrictively in accordance with regulations 
<br />
conceived and imposed by those cleverer individuals who claimed very 
<br />
aloud - and convincingly - that they were the owners of natural and 
<br />
man-made circumstances but give the masses permission to live there 
<br />
and also to work for improving these circumstances.
<br />
<p>Therefore the information gradually integrated in the domain of one 
<br />
or another civilization has been necessarily the source of motivation 
<br />
for increasing the discovery and invention of more and more causal 
<br />
interactions of those aspects of the surrounding reality that might 
<br />
increase faster and faster the efficiency and efficacy of the human 
<br />
utilitarianism which started as tool making by means of hand work and 
<br />
has culminated until today in the generalized automation technology 
<br />
needed indispensably for assuring the
<br />
<p>Therefore the main features of the civilizing adventure have been 
<br />
conceiving discovering and inventing causal interactions of phenomena 
<br />
needed for modernizing the civilizing concern according to criteria 
<br />
formulated by the common sense of the owners of every terrestrial 
<br />
environment, who are always ready to claim that they are really 
<br />
highly civilized humans, and to argue that they are deeply interested 
<br />
in maintaining the functionality of civilizing processes which sooner 
<br />
or later will bring happiness to all humans. Sometimes, these well 
<br />
educated philanthropists dare to include the masses as part of 
<br />
humankind.
<br />
<p>The whole civilization has caused the emergence of another world 
<br />
(located inside the biosphere) gradually integrated exclusively for 
<br />
human purposes. During the last centuries this world has become the 
<br />
huge homosphere whose dynamics is frankly:
<br />
<p>1.	increasingly contradictory with itself because billions of 
<br />
humans are unable to satisfy decently - as if they were civilized 
<br />
fellows - their survival needs;
<br />
<p>2.	increasingly incoherent with the need, and not simply 
<br />
possibility, of pushing ahead the humane development of human 
<br />
capabilities because an increasing number of technological and 
<br />
methodological processes are nowadays conceived, designed and 
<br />
implemented for replacing human workers by automatic devices and also 
<br />
for changing the performance of the masses by means of modern 
<br />
'educational' courses that aim at training and taming beings who were 
<br />
born for being elements of the masses, but still need to be 
<br />
conditioned properly and systematically  for willing to be happy 
<br />
while learning to live miserably as buyers and consumers of 
<br />
everything, anything and nothing in accordance with the rules that 
<br />
will assure the successful manifestation of the Global Free Market.
<br />
<p>3.	increasingly incongruous with the planetary possibilities 
<br />
because the economic development - conceived by means of an 
<br />
exhaustive exploitation of everything in order to increase the 
<br />
monetary profits ad infinitum - continuously augments the level of 
<br />
pollution of the terrestrial features that are only limited 
<br />
possibilities for the existence of humans;
<br />
<p>4.	increasingly inconsistent with the need of protecting the 
<br />
biodiversity that characterizes the manifestation of life in our 
<br />
unique planet because the monetary interests that are determining the 
<br />
world wide economy intends rather dogmatically not only to make 
<br />
homogeneous everything but also to exploit exhaustively the organs, 
<br />
features and anatomic components of other animals. The number of 
<br />
endangered species is increasing faster and faster.
<br />
<p>Anyhow the INFORMATION accumulated through diverse kinds of permitted 
<br />
(#) COMMUNICATION among humans shows quite evidently that the whole 
<br />
civilizing adventure has become a catastrophic ambiguity as it has 
<br />
been generated by intelligent decision making conceived and 
<br />
implemented by very clever and highly civilized humans

<p>PUBLIC RIGHT-TO-KNOW UNDERMINED IN NEW POLLUTION TREATY
<br />
<p>FRIENDS OF THE EARTH INTERNATIONAL (Press  Release)
<br />
<p>Amsterdam, 21st November, 2002 -- Negotiations on a new international 
<br />
treaty to increase the public's right-to-know on sources of pollution 
<br />
enter the final stages with a United Nations meeting in Geneva next 
<br />
week.
<br />
<p>(#) But environmentalists are warning that key chemicals and 
<br />
radioactive waste are likely to be excluded from the treaty, 
<br />
following lobbying from industry and the conservative positions taken 
<br />
by governments.
<br />
<p>Delegates are discussing the new protocol under the 1998 Aarhus 
<br />
&quot;public participation&quot; Convention, which will require participating 
<br />
countries to collect and publish information on quantities of 
<br />
pollutants released from certain industrial sources and probably from 
<br />
diffuse sources such as traffic.
<br />
<p>The meeting follows a two-year process involving countries from 
<br />
Europe, Central Asia, the US and Canada, as well as representatives 
<br />
from environmental NGOs, including Friends of the Earth, and 
<br />
representatives from the chemical industry (CEFIC).
<br />
<p>The information will be compiled in to &quot;Pollutant Release and 
<br />
Transfer Registers&quot; or &quot;PRTRs&quot;.  Such registers are already used in 
<br />
the UK and US and are believed to have helped drive down pollution 
<br />
levels and provided both the public and authorities with useful 
<br />
information.
<br />
<p>A number of key issues are still to be resolved, including which 
<br />
chemicals are to be listed, with suggestions that many chemicals 
<br />
linked to cancer should be excluded.  Decisions are also still to be 
<br />
made as to whether the disposal or storage of hazardous chemicals 
<br />
on-site should be included. The exact list of industries and 
<br />
activities covered is also still to be finalized, but countries are 
<br />
overwhelmingly opposed to the inclusion of nuclear facilities under 
<br />
the treaty.
<br />
<p>Environmentalists have pushed for a more ambitious treaty, whilst 
<br />
recognizing that a comprehensive pollution register cannot be 
<br />
achieved in one single stage. But European Union countries have 
<br />
opposed the more ambitious elements proposed in the initial draft.
<br />
<p>Friends of the Earth Pollution Researcher, Mary Taylor, speaking for 
<br />
the NGO coalition European ECO Forum, said : &quot;The protocol should be 
<br />
a step forward for many countries, but the lack of ambition - 
<br />
particularly from the EU - is dismal.  The public should have the 
<br />
right to know what chemicals are being discharged by companies and 
<br />
where they are being stored. Protecting certain sectors such as the 
<br />
nuclear industry from public scrutiny, or avoiding the inclusion of 
<br />
cancer-causing chemicals, is scandalous.&quot;
