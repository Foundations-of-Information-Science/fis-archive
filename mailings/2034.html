<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Victoras and Stan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not think it is consistent to discuss meaning of operations in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe within a physicalistic paradigm. I admit that a thermodynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradigm is more advanced that a mechanistic one encompassing the basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolutionary mechanisms and if you add a Wienerian cybernetic information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory and the inspiration from Schrödinger, then you now have scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concepts that can say something about systems building up structures and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evaluate if they become more complex.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But this objectivistic scientific philosophical framework - and I am tempted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to still call it physicalistic - does not have any theory of meaning, only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of truth. Bateson developed a theory of ecological cybernetic mind as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recursive loops folded into each other carrying differences, but it never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said anything about qualia, free will and consciousness as a first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience. I do not know if you want to use fraises like: &quot;what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning of the computers work seen from the computer?&quot;
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important point, for which I do, however, have an answer
<br />
within the framework I have been using.  Of the four Aristotelian causes,
<br />
material/formal, efficient/final, it is no long leap to see that final
<br />
cause is of the same type as 'meaning'.  And, of course, my point has been
<br />
that the Second Law provides a very general meaning to all activities.
<br />
There are, of course, other meanings as well, organized as {most primary
<br />
meaning {{{more superior meanings}}}}.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My point is that you need to define a concept of meaning within your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradigm's ontology (including both a world view and a conception of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human) and relate your concepts of truth and meaning to that, to be able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer the questions you ask. This is why I found it necessary to go &gt;from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cybernetic informational world view to a Peircean semiotic one like Stan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-although I think we have different versions. Your question cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answered on the thermodynamic level.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the most basic meaning in the Universe is not sufficient
<br />
to understand all events. It is restricted to the physical integrative
<br />
level in a whole series of integrative levels, as in: {physical {material
<br />
{biological {sociopolitical {personal}}}}} (I find semiosis at allthese
<br />
levels -- pansemiotics).  But, in Natural Philosophy, we wish to capture
<br />
the broadest view, incorporating as much of Nature as we can, and so we can
<br />
bring in many things.  In some cases, like human warfare pursued by modern
<br />
societies there does not appear to be a satisfactory understanding of it at
<br />
any level above the physical, and so we must be content with that, however
<br />
humiliating it is to see that modern society cannot rise above its lowly
<br />
basis.  There is a way available actually -- the one China is now pursuing
<br />
-- that is, build, build BUILD, and build big, BIG enough to expend as much
<br />
energy in the doing as would be dissipated during warfare.  The problem
<br />
with this is that its ultimate end is the destruction of our natural
<br />
environment. In warfare we only destroy our own things, in building we
<br />
destroy everything.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even on the semiotic it is very difficult. Is the goal of the universe or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather the Semios to evolve as much semiotic freedom as possible? Is it the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;goal of living systems? Is free will the highest gift in the universe?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we go up in the specification hierarchy above, the number of
<br />
meanings increases because this hierarchy (although not shown in the above
<br />
representation) is actually a tree with its root in the physcal.  Thus, one
<br />
would have choose at, say, the sociopolitical level which of all the
<br />
numerous meanings have been constructed at that level would be &quot;the highest
<br />
(most superior) gift&quot;.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can then easily add a spiritual dimension to your pan semiotic theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and include the idea of the mystical union. If so is the meaning of life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then to unify mentally with the universe and its cause in a mystical union
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maybe on a transcendental level? If yes to these questions, then: why??
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past some authors did indeed implicitly use te above format,
<br />
and ended with a mystical union as the most superior meaning.  But, since
<br />
this end did not arise in more than on or two cultures, we can see that
<br />
there would be contention over this, which as we can see today within the
<br />
Abrahamic Faith Religions, since these meanings are non-negotiable, we are
<br />
soon back to warfare again, which will, once again, not be explainable
<br />
within these superior understandings.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even if the answer is: To obtain the highest love and happiness and wise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conduct, you can ask again: Though love and happiness they feel nice and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make us live in a better way together you can still ask why? To what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;purpose?
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be answers at all integrative levels: {entropy production
<br />
{ATP utilization {reproduction{ self-realization}}}}.  In ths case we seem
<br />
to have a satsfactory superior understanding, and so we can forget the
<br />
lower integrative levels.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can add heaven and hell or reincarnation with thousands of life cycles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in learning to be good, wise and loving, and Buddha nature or a personal or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;triune God - and the question still remains unanswered. What is the purpose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and meaning of God and what he does with us?? The answer is - even in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bible - that only he/she knows.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there are any answers -- as many as there are cultures with
<br />
religions.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am afraid that the condition of being inside a system does not allow us to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer questions about its purpose and meaning.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one of the messages of the internalist session just finished
<br />
on this list.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will be grateful if anyone can provide a more satisfactory answer.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See above.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;some questions to meditate on :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;whatever occurs there are two sorts of &quot;things&quot; always going on:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;A) production of entropy - 2nd law,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;B) production of structure - (self)organization (???law).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If we assume that whatever occurs, it does so in order to produce entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(A)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then (self)organization (B) is &quot;just&quot; a side-effect of entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;production..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: From the Universe's point of view that is exactly so.  It can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;justifed arithmetically by noting that effective (irreversible) works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always lose half or more of the available energy tapped for them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Otherwise whatever occurs, it does so in order to produce structure (B),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;entropy (A) is &quot;just&quot; a side-effect of (self)organization...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    SS: This is the point of view of a local system. It cannot be justified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arithmetically.  As well, the Second Law, as a global tendency was in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effect prior to any local system, all of which must serve it in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;develop and maintain themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Which one of the two statements above is true ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    SS: Both are true from different perspectives.  As a natural philsopher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interested in the Unity of Nature program, I take the Universe's point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view.  (As well, I tend to favor the seeming underdog!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Is it so that when I write the message (like this particular one) I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;driven by the final reason to produce entropy by increased usage of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;electricity, making keyboard and processor of my PC a bit warmer and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;heating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;some cables on the way to people I communicate with, in order to force
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;somebody's brain to burn more glucose in order to release more warm into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;environment thus increasing global warming and adding some more heat into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the expanding Universe in order to drive it's state a bit further from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;thermodynamic equilibrium then it is now ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: VERY well put!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Is the meaning of the message
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;encoded within grammatical language structures just a waste-product of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;entropy production chain ? Whichever - entropy or (self)organization is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;purpose and the driving force of whatever occurs ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      SS: As I said, both. We can parse this nicely by using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specification hierarchy of final causes in the form of {physical process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;{chemical interaction {biological configuration {sociopolitical intent}}}}.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus,  {entropy production {lowering free energy {muscle movement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;{writing}}}}.  In the Unity of the Sciences we want to see the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;picture.  As it was put by the systems scientist Hector Sabelli, {primary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;{superior}}.   If you like the suprior, take it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The same would be valid for any complex structure or system, would it be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;genetic code, living organism, ecosystem, or architecture, cities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;countries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; creations of science or art. In every process of (self)organization there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;are always two results produced - structure and waste (entropy). Content of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;energy is higher in wastes while content of information is higher in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;structures. Whichever - energy or information - is more important in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;context ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: Take your pick.  As an example where the Universal point of view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to emerge more cogently, perhaps, we can examine the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;{entropy production {animal agression {human warfare}}}.  Universally we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see all scripted cultures denouncing warfare, but all engaging in it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much as possible nevertheless.  In that situation, we cannot find an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informational content explanation/justification (stimulating the economy?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- why do that? S o our population can grow?  Why do that?, etc.), and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is easy to drop down to a lower integrative level. Well, here animal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aggression does not really well explain modern warfare, although this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entrained by it in the young males usually assigned to carry out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destruction.  However, we can easily see that entropy production for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universe is a perfect explanation for it.  We cannot resist warfare because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we cannot resist the most prominent law of Nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So is the ENTROPY the final cause of (self)organization, or is it an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;inevitable side-effect ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: It is one (the most general or primary) final cause of it.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are interested in other causes, be my guest -- efficient, material, formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causes are all waiting for you to examine them.  I am interesting in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bringing final cause back into the fold of thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Do we build our architecture (and overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;civilization) in order to produce waste and release more energy into our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;environment (***thus driving our civilization towards a sure death), or in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;order to build something that we could look at, walk through or live in ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: As long as we engage in war while denouncing it at the same time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am entitled to say that we build in order to burn so that we may rebuild
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again -- endlessly, with the ultimate result (after our superstructures lie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the sand like the pyramids) of having satisfactorily contributed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universal equilibration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Are we having environmental problems because of all the waste (heat,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;pollution released into our environment) we produce, or should we look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;production of all that waste as the driving force and the final reason of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;emergence of our human civilization and all economies ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: As long as we pursue the fastest energy flowthrough in producing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever we produce, we are first contributing to Universal equilibration,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and building whatever in order to accomplish that. For example the American
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;love of heavy, fast cars makes no sense unless seen in this light.  Here we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have: {entropy production {nervous system thrill {car racing}}}.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If the Entropy is the final reason, then it also means that the final
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of our civilization is its final death (refer to ***)...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SS: One must conclude this when looking at, say, American history.
