<p>
FIS Friends,
<br />
<p>A modest heap of ideas is accumulating on info ethics. I will comment on 
<br />
some recent postings (Stan, Rafael, Michael...)
<br />
<p>To Stan's simplifications on Global Capitalism, second law plus Darwinian 
<br />
penchant, I would had another two: complexity growth and instinct of 
<br />
&quot;conformity with the group&quot;, both in combination with the previous ones. 
<br />
Complexity growth may occur precisely because of the introduction of 
<br />
-&quot;constraints&quot;, from the very beginning (at the very quantum level of 
<br />
Pauli's exclusion principle!). In human language, the constraints we 
<br />
introduce either in pronunciation or in grammar make possible the 
<br />
linguistic fabrication of open-ended contents. Such rules clearly represent 
<br />
a burden, but are a necessary path to follow in order to generate 
<br />
novelty.  It also occurs socially, for we can organize a complex social 
<br />
structure only because people have to follow an increasingly complex set of 
<br />
rules (e.g., think on traffic). Then, the instinct of &quot;conformity with the 
<br />
group&quot; appears as a curious phenomenon, a sort of collective life-saving 
<br />
device which is widely shared among anthropoidea, and that in the human 
<br />
case creeps into a vast variety of social networkings, primitive and 
<br />
advanced ones. At the same time, we compete and are willing to stay safely 
<br />
into the pack. In the US it means it means Wall Street and Silicon Valley 
<br />
together with &quot;Sunday America&quot; and religious fundamentalism... In any case, 
<br />
there seems possible to draw neat relationships of ethics with these two 
<br />
new aspects that add some spice to Second Law and Darwinian competence.
<br />
<p>Then Rafael says that &quot;ethics is an informational science as far as it 
<br />
analizes morality i.e. the rules of society(ies) considering them under the 
<br />
conditions of their historical development and future possibilities. The 
<br />
key point is then how far such rules block societal development which means 
<br />
at the same time that the &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;goals&quot; must/can be reconsidered and 
<br />
&quot;re-imaginized.&quot; This is the deep connection between ethics with drama, 
<br />
poetry, music...&quot;  I much agree with the vision of ethics as an 
<br />
informational science, particularly because of the &quot;closure&quot; operation that 
<br />
ethics has to perform at the social level. Other integrative disciplines 
<br />
are forced to such closure operations, but perhaps none of them with the 
<br />
amplitude and complexity that ethics has to confront. We have not talked 
<br />
about &quot;values&quot; yet... are they a shorthand for people being able to get a 
<br />
collective ethical orientation, a minimalist &quot;mapping&quot; allowing themselves 
<br />
to align with the group? In the relationship between ethics, arts, sciences 
<br />
and technologies I would disagree with Foucault's over-extended use of the 
<br />
term technologies (see in Rafael's); it can be  confusing and misleading.
<br />
<p>I have already pointed that the informational discussion of ethics should 
<br />
connect with Jared Diamond's (1996) proposals on the evolution of social 
<br />
complexity. And some of Michael's points on books, media, etc., might be 
<br />
discussed along the guidelines of the informational needs of societies as 
<br />
their complexity grows. This idea may be extended to reopen Richard's and 
<br />
Marcin's suggestions about organizing some modest research on a taxonomy of 
<br />
information. To put it in the terms of the current discussion, the 
<br />
evolution of societies is another theater where an informational way of 
<br />
thinking may enrich traditional disciplines.
<br />
<p>At the time being, however, that fis explorations dovetail in conventional 
<br />
institutional settings looks almost a miracle ---unless institutional 
<br />
proposals presented in Paris (2005) by some fis parties fructify, we will 
<br />
be left in the could permanently. As far as I know, Dail, Mary Joe, and 
<br />
Wolfgang are already doing some legal and administrative advancements, so 
<br />
that interesting &quot;novelties&quot; might occur relatively soon. Who knows?
<br />
<p>with best wishes,
<br />
<p>Pedro   
<br />
