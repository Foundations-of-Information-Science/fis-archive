                    John, Jamie, Pedro, Koichiro and to the list:
                    <br />
                <p>This email responds to the posts by John C and Jamie R. on the topic of
                    <br />
                    &quot;Biological Computing.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Before reading this email, I would encourage readers to re-read the
                    <br />
                    excellent post of Koichiro Matsuno of June 26, 2006 and Pedro's post of
                    <br />
                    Nov. 17, 2006 in order to place my remarks in context.
                    <br />
                <p>First, I note that several concepts of computing exist. A computation may
                    <br />
                    be exact or inexact; the logic of computation may be either exact or
                    <br />
                    inexact. For example, I may compute the outcome of a staff meeting on
                    <br />
                    sensitive personal issues. Or, I may compute exactly the Alexander
                    <br />
                    polynomial of a particular twist knot. Or, I may compute exactly the
                    <br />
                    products of a chemical reaction. I most certainly can not compute exactly
                    <br />
                    the value of pi. The many possible usages of the concepts of computing,
                    <br />
                    both exact and inexact, should be considered when reading this post.
                    <br />
                    Finally, I note that living systems compute exactly which chemical
                    <br />
                    structures to reproduce and do so exactly; this is what is called inheritance.
                    <br />
                <p>John's narrative is, to me, very puzzling. I do not understand the
                    <br />
                    relation, if it exists, between the concepts used in sentences and the
                    <br />
                    notion of biological computing.
                    <br />
                <p>Without reference, John states:
                    <br />
                    &quot;...Atlan's use of computational
                    <br />
                    language along with his claim that some biological (biochemical really)
                    <br />
                    stuctures have &quot;inifinite sophistication&quot;. A structure with infinite
                    <br />
                    sophistication cannot be computed from the properties of its
                    <br />
                    components.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>I find no chemical sense in this statement.
                    <br />
                    I have no idea how a chemical structure can have &quot;inifinite sophistication&quot;.
                    <br />
                    Is either Atlan (or possibly John inadvertently) creating a false concept
                    <br />
                    of chemistry to serve a philosophical goal?
                    <br />
                    Is Atlan attempting to force the chemical sciences into a procrustean bed
                    <br />
                    of mathematical physics?
                    <br />
                    The concept of &quot;inifinite sophistication&quot; is dangerously close to rejecting
                    <br />
                    a basic notion of the chemical sciences, namely, that matter is composed of
                    <br />
                    multi-sets of atoms.
                    <br />
                <p>The concept of &quot;computational depth&quot; is well defined in computer science
                    <br />
                    but not in chemistry.
                    <br />
                    The chemical reference system starts with (begins with, is resourced in, is
                    <br />
                    a narrative of) parts of atoms and constructs higher order biological
                    <br />
                    structures from these parts. Chemistry is a mereologic science.
                    <br />
                    In other words, the computations of chemistry start at the deepest level,
                    <br />
                    the intangible space filling concepts of parts and constructs upward to
                    <br />
                    systems of larger size, Life itself.
                    <br />
                    What has computational depth of the computer science variety to do with
                    <br />
                    chemistry or molecular biology?
                    <br />
                <p>John deepens the mystery with the following paragraph:
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;Here is my stab at an answer: the notion of mechanical since Goedel and
                    <br />
                    Turing (I would say since Lowenheim-Skolem, since Turing's and Goedel's
                    <br />
                    results are implicit in their theorems) breaks up into to notions,
                    <br />
                    stepwise mechanical and globally mechanical.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Is the pot calling the kettle black?
                    <br />
                <p>If the real number system is a mathematical structure for mechanical
                    <br />
                    computation,
                    <br />
                    stepwise mechanical is a SUBSET of global mechanical.
                    <br />
                <p>Or, am I missing the point?
                    <br />
                    Does John wish to imply that calculations can be made with Cantorian numbers?
                    <br />
                    A critical fact to note along this line is that living systems calculate on
                    <br />
                    how to reproduce themselves chemically and do it regularly, without help
                    <br />
                    from Cantor, Rosen or Turing.
                    <br />
                <p>It seems to me that if one wishes to conceptualize biological computing,
                    <br />
                    one ought to start with the notion of chemical principles as sources of
                    <br />
                    information of codes for exact chemical relations. Empirically, the
                    <br />
                    supporting facts for this conjecture has been around for more than fifty
                    <br />
                    years. I guess that the new ideas flowing into philosophy are retarded by
                    <br />
                    mechanisms that I do not understand.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>Jamie writes an equally curious piece. Rather than looking at living
                    <br />
                    systems as natural objects with natural computational properties, Jamie
                    <br />
                    prefers to place mechanics of computational abstraction:
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The thema of computation is the separation of
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware from software.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the thema of of natural systems is
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conjoinment of 'hardware' with 'software'.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>as the principle premise in his efforts to develop syllogisms. Why?
                    <br />
                <p>A concept, &quot;the thema of of natural systems&quot; is separated into two terms,
                    <br />
                    hardware and software.
                    <br />
                    For what purpose is this strawman constructed?
                    <br />
                <p>Stereochemistry! Really!
                    <br />
                <p>This leads to the conclusion:
                    <br />
                    &quot;The 'hardware' of the metabolic step IS the
                    <br />
                    'software' .. in this example, the stereoform
                    <br />
                    acts as the specific instruction 'yes/no' or
                    <br />
                    '1/0'.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>If this is the case, that the hardware is the software, why bother with
                    <br />
                    the initial premise at all?
                    <br />
                    To suggest that the information in a chemical structure is reduced to a
                    <br />
                    'yes - no' is also a very novel approach to chemical information theory.
                    <br />
                <p>Jamie continues:
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;Adaptation&quot; capacity is naturally intrinsic
                    <br />
                    with living cells. It will not happen unless
                    <br />
                    'imposed' - in classical computer systems.
                    <br />
                <p>Let me give a brief narrative that contradicts this view of computer systems.
                    <br />
                    An idealized computer system in the &quot;idle mode&quot; is a homostatic device.
                    <br />
                    It is structured to adapt to inputs.
                    <br />
                    Following an input, a key stroke, the computer system is perturbed and
                    <br />
                    adapts to the perturbation by changing as many electrical flows as
                    <br />
                    necessary in order to return to the 'idle' mode, to homostasis.
                    <br />
                <p>In other words, from a purely mechanical perspective, an ideal computer is
                    <br />
                    an adaptive device and the narrative of adaptations for a living system and
                    <br />
                    a computational system are parallel in certain fundamental aspects of
                    <br />
                    temporal pathways of response to perturbations.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>It appears to me that both Koichiro's and Pedro's narratives (cited above)
                    <br />
                    are closer to the future and that we should look to extend their
                    <br />
                    perspectives in ways that are consistent with Life itself. I note in
                    <br />
                    passing that I am working on a paper on the logic of a new relational
                    <br />
                    system, the perplex number system for atomic numbers, that I hope will
                    <br />
                    contribute to resolving some of the condundrums raised by this topic.
                    <br />

                <p>Pedro,
                    <br />
                <p>If you will indulge me in one additional comment in this
                    <br />
                    topic also. There is a critically important analysis I
                    <br />
                    did a number of years ago on the issue of operational
                    <br />
                    differences between computer/computation practices and
                    <br />
                    natural biological/botanical systems.
                    <br />
                <p>Without belaboring the point is comes down to this:
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thema of computation is the separation of
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware from software.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the thema of of natural systems is
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conjoinment of 'hardware' with 'software'.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Every computer system has a design matrix of
                    <br />
                    information routings into-which or onto-which
                    <br />
                    instruction codes are imposed.
                    <br />
                <p>That does not happen in natural systems.
                    <br />
                    Let me give an example.
                    <br />
                <p>Stereo-chemically some molecules can be exactly the
                    <br />
                    same atomic constituents, but be mirror images in
                    <br />
                    3D structure. The levo- and dextro- rotary forms.
                    <br />
                <p>Because metabolic pathways rely heavily, if not
                    <br />
                    absolutely, on key-lock compatability (because of
                    <br />
                    electromagnetic 'fit' considerations), one twist
                    <br />
                    form will 'enable' a pathway step, while the
                    <br />
                    mirror form will 'block' the step.
                    <br />
                <p>The 'hardware' of the metabolic step IS the
                    <br />
                    'software' .. in this example, the stereoform
                    <br />
                    acts as the specific instruction 'yes/no' or
                    <br />
                    '1/0'.
                    <br />
                <p>This is THE KEY thematic/functional difference
                    <br />
                    between their information processings.
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;Adaptation&quot; capacity is naturally intrinsic
                    <br />
                    with living cells. It will not happen unless
                    <br />
                    'imposed' - in classical computer systems.
                    <br />
                <p>They approach, involve, and use 'information'
                    <br />
                    relations in quite different ways. AI - as
                    <br />
                    currently formulated/practiced - will never
                    <br />
                    perfectly emulate Life. 'Simulation' will be
                    <br />
                    only close approximations, instead of practical
                    <br />
                    duplications.

                <p>Dear colleagues,
                    <br />
                <p>Pedro has pointed out a real problem, I think. I have a few words to say
                    <br />
                    on it that may be of some help in sorting out the issues. They derive
                    <br />
                    partly from my trying to make sense of Atlan's use of computational
                    <br />
                    language along with his claim that some biological (biochemical really)
                    <br />
                    stuctures have &quot;inifinite sophistication&quot;. A structure with infinite
                    <br />
                    sophistication cannot be computed from the properties of its
                    <br />
                    components. Sophistication, as far as I can tell, is a measure of
                    <br />
                    computational depth, which depends on the minimal number of
                    <br />
                    computational steps to produce the surface structure from the maximally
                    <br />
                    compressed form (Charles Bennett). Atlan has made the connection, but
                    <br />
                    also noted it is not fully clear as yet, since Bennett's measure is
                    <br />
                    purely in terms of computational steps, and is relative to maximal
                    <br />
                    compression, not components. Cliff Hooker and I noted these problems
                    <br />
                    (before we knew of Atlan's work -- well, I did, but it was presented
                    <br />
                    poorly by one of his students -- see Complexly Organized Dynamical

                    <br />
                    The
                    <br />
                    question relevant to Pedro's post is why is computation relevant if
                    <br />
                    common biological systems have infinite sophistication, and thus are not
                    <br />
                    effectively computable, even if they have finite complexity?
                    <br />
                <p>Here is my stab at an answer: the notion of mechanical since Goedel and
                    <br />
                    Turing (I would say since Lowenheim-Skolem, since Turing's and Goedel's
                    <br />
                    results are implicit in their theorems) breaks up into to notions,
                    <br />
                    stepwise mechanical and globally mechanical. A globally mechanical
                    <br />
                    system can be represented by an algorithm that halts on all relevant
                    <br />
                    inputs (Knuth algorithm); these are computable globally. The stepwise
                    <br />
                    ones have no global solution that is effectively computable, but are
                    <br />
                    computable locally (to an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy). The
                    <br />
                    difference is similar to that between a Turing machine that halts on all
                    <br />
                    relevant inputs and one that does not. Both are machines, but only the
                    <br />
                    latter corresponds to Rosen's restricted notion of mechanical. So
                    <br />
                    computation theory can help us to understand the difference between
                    <br />
                    things that are stepwise mechanical, and things that are not. Things of
                    <br />
                    infinite sophistication are not globally mechanical. I will say without
                    <br />
                    proving that they correspond to Rosen's systems that have analytical
                    <br />
                    models but no synthetic models. They may still be mechanical in the
                    <br />
                    weaker sense. In fact I have not been able to see how they cannot be
                    <br />
                    mechanical in this way.
                    <br />
                <p>Consequently, there are Turing machines that are mathematically
                    <br />
                    equivalent to systems of infinite sophistication, but they do not halt.
                    <br />
                <p>So you are probably wondering how processes of this sort can occur in
                    <br />
                    finite time. The answer is dissipation. I'll not give the solution here,
                    <br />
                    as my coauthor on another paper just came into the room and asked me how
                    <br />
                    it was going, and I said I was writing something else that was
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    there is a clue in the BBS commentary.

                    <br />
                    Dear FISers,
                    <br />
                <p>I was recently asked some short views summarizing the field of
                    <br />
                    biological
                    <br />
                    computation. After several weeks delay, I finally penned a few lines.
                    <br />
                    Maybe
                    <br />
                    someone in the list can find some interest in the very rough reflections
                    <br />
                    below.
                    <br />
                <p>-----------------------
                    <br />
                <p>In my view, there is some trouble in biological computation or
                    <br />
                    bioinformation or whatever name one chooses for the field. One of the
                    <br />
                    main
                    <br />
                    inputs has traditionally come from theoretical biology, even in the 60's
                    <br />
                <p>(e.g., Waddington, Dancoff &amp; Quastler, von Bertalanffy), but mostly in
                    <br />
                    late
                    <br />
                    80's and early 90's, with leading figures such as Michael Conrad and
                    <br />
                    Robert
                    <br />
                    Rosen. They both were very critical on any easy-going marriage between
                    <br />
                    computers and biology. Michael produced a very fine contraposition of
                    <br />
                    computational differences, between living cells and classical computers,
                    <br />
                <p>from the point of view of adaptability. On the other side, the
                    <br />
                    influences
                    <br />
                    from computer fields did crystallize into Artificial Intelligence, and
                    <br />
                    more
                    <br />
                    recently into Artificial Life (Holland, Brooks, Langton, etc.) and
                    <br />
                    perhaps
                    <br />
                    complexity theorists (Kauffman); notwithstanding important differences
                    <br />
                    among these fields , as a whole they never saw any terrible difficulty
                    <br />
                    in
                    <br />
                    the cross-fertilization, or better hybridization, between computers and
                    <br />
                    biology.
                    <br />
                <p>In actuality I think that around &quot;biological computing&quot; there is a very
                    <br />
                    tough problem --that means I am unable to produce any really convincing
                    <br />
                    argument! But the whole point may be that biological microscopic
                    <br />
                    functional
                    <br />
                    elements (say the enzyme, or the nucleic acid stretch) are not amenable
                    <br />
                    to
                    <br />
                    &quot;sufficient&quot; logical description in similar terms to functional
                    <br />
                    components
                    <br />
                    of computers. Structure, functionality, estrategy, etc. are in every
                    <br />
                    respect (and every &quot;level&quot;) non-comparable, and in general
                    <br />
                    non-compatible.
                    <br />
                    The basic functionalist point of separability between hard and software
                    <br />
                    DOES NOT RULE biologically. Of course, in science one can always drop
                    <br />
                    embarrassing elements of distinction... by &quot;disciplinary&quot; fiat. And
                    <br />
                    then
                    <br />
                    produce flamboyant names &quot;artif. intel.&quot;, &quot;artif. life&quot;,
                    &quot;biocomputing&quot;,
                    <br />
                    etc.
                    <br />
                <p>In the fis discussion list I produced several further arguments
                    <br />
                    ( &lt;<a href="default.htm">http://fis.icts.sbg.ac.at/mailings/</a>&gt;<a
                        href="default.htm">http://fis.icts.sbg.ac.at/mailings/</a>
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;), in the 2005 discussion on
                    <br />
                    molecular bionetworks.
                    <br />
                <p>Anyhow, thanks for the stimulus to pen these late reflections.
                    <br />
