<br />
Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>This is a reply to the comments by James Barham (3 June). I apologize for
<br />
the delay, but his comments came when I just had returned to Alaska from
<br />
three weeks at ICTP in Italy. Not just work at the office awaited me: its
<br />
summertime in central Alaska, 22 hs of sunshine, 25°C average temperature,
<br />
plants grow like crazy, and I have to help my wife to put and keep the
<br />
garden in shape. Tomorrow I will reply to Pedro's comments of 5 June.
<br />
<p>Comments received are preceded by &gt;&gt;
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You seem to be saying that all pragmatic information use is communication.
</em><br />
Here I disagree. I think we have to allow for a single organism interacting
<br />
with the inorganic part of its environment as being an instance of genuine
<br />
information use, as well.
<br />
<p>I really am not saying that! I should make that clear in my paper. I
<br />
definitely agree that an organism ACQUIRING information from the
<br />
environment, or STORING information in the environment, represents what I
<br />
call &quot;information-based interactions&quot; (i.e., a genuine use of information).
<br />
See further below the examples of prototype biological interactions. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So, the question of the locus of information must be posed for each of the
</em><br />
following four different cases:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;monadic:
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(A) inorganic, intrinsic
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(B) organic, intrinsic
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;dyadic:
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(B-A) organic-inorganic interaction
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(B-C) organic-organic interaction
</em><br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In regard to my first remark above, I simply want to emphasize that the
</em><br />
dyadic relation (B-A) represents pragmatic information use just as much as
<br />
(B-C) does. Indeed, I feel it is the more basic kind of interaction. I am
<br />
not sure whether you will agree with me about this point, or not.
<br />
<p>I absolutely agree! (Again, see below).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In regard to my second remark above, most here at FIS want to say that (A)
</em><br />
embodies intrinsic information, while you and I (and Pedro and Jerry, I
<br />
think) want to deny it. How can we clarify the point at issue between the
<br />
pan-informationists and the bio-informationists?
<br />
<p>I certainly deny it. That is at the key of the reason why I prefer to start
<br />
everything with the process of INTERACTION as a &quot;metaphysical primitive&quot;. By
<br />
definition, interaction means TWO or MORE bodies, systems or things.
<br />
<p>James' comments in that 3 June mail convinced me of a weakness in my paper:
<br />
a lack of concrete examples, and a lack of clear grouping of prototypes (a
<br />
term that may not be metaphysically correct). Here is what I am going to add
<br />
to the paper's section 1 before submission (I apologize for the length):
<br />
<p>***********************
<br />
&quot;&quot;To elucidate more clearly the characteristics of information-based
<br />
interactions, identify different prototypes, and compare them with the class
<br />
of force-field driven interactions, let us analyze a few examples.
<br />
<p>1.	An electron scattered by a positive ion. From the point of view of
<br />
quantum electrodynamics, the interaction mechanism consists of the emission
<br />
and absorption of virtual photons by the interacting particles. In a
<br />
first-order Feynman diagram the electron (or the ion) emits a photon which
<br />
is then absorbed by the ion (or electron); energy and momentum balance at
<br />
each node (emission/absorption process) account for a change in the motion
<br />
of each particle. The end result, strictly reversible, is the sum total of
<br />
all possible photon exchange processes; the total energy (and momentum) of
<br />
the pair of particles is conserved. We are tempted to say (and often do so)
<br />
that in this interaction, any virtual photon &quot;carries information&quot; from one
<br />
particle to the other; however, this is purely subjective parlance: no
<br />
information, information-processing and purpose are at work at either end of
<br />
the emission/absorption process.
<br />
<p>2.	A small body orbiting an irregularly shaped massive asteroid. (e.g.,
<br />
asteroid Ida with its satellite Dactyl). This is a macroscopic physical
<br />
interaction. The resulting orbit, viewed from a system fixed to the
<br />
asteroid, is very complicated due to the latter's irregular mass
<br />
distribution; the resulting motion of the satellite is governed by the sum
<br />
total of the gravitational actions (forces) of each element of mass of the
<br />
asteroid, in each of which information and information-processing do not
<br />
play any role. There is strict to-and-fro energy coupling (and functional
<br />
continuity) between the orbital characteristics and the irregular features
<br />
of the asteroid's gravitational potential. As there is a correspondence
<br />
between the features of a particular orbit and the irregularities of mass
<br />
distribution, we are again tempted to say that the orbital shape &quot;carries
<br />
information on the pattern of mass distribution in the asteroid&quot;. However,
<br />
no information is at work in this natural system; each element of the
<br />
pattern at the &quot;source&quot; or &quot;sender&quot; (the asteroid) contributes with a direct
<br />
dynamic effect on the &quot;receiver&quot; (the satellite) and there is no need to
<br />
invoke the concepts of information and information processing. Another
<br />
similar example is the footprint of a rock that has been lying on the soil
<br />
for a long time. Here we have a complex pattern on the ground carved by the
<br />
elastic interaction with the rock's irregular surface-an interaction in
<br />
which a fixed pattern has led to specific change in another &quot;body&quot;. However,
<br />
the change was produced by point-by-point physical interactions in which
<br />
there was a direct coupling (force- and energy-wise) between the &quot;source&quot;
<br />
and the &quot;recipient&quot;. Again, no purpose can be identified in this process. 
<br />
<p>In both above examples we have a physical interaction between two objects
<br />
mediated by a &quot;field&quot;, with energy coupling and continuity. There is no
<br />
information, signals, messages, codes, decisions or purpose involved-unless
<br />
we, humans, put them there by making a mental model of the interaction
<br />
process in which analogies are drawn from subjective experience. The
<br />
following are prototypes of information-based interactions.
<br />
<p>3.	A dog walking around an obstacle. The dog responds to the visual
<br />
perception of the obstacle, a complex process that involves
<br />
information-processing and decision-making at the &quot;receiver's&quot; end with a
<br />
definite purpose. At the obstacle's (the sender's) side, we have scattering
<br />
and/or reflection of incident light waves; no information and no purpose are
<br />
involved-only physical processes are at work here. There is no energy
<br />
coupling between sender and receiver; like in the example of the insects of
<br />
Fig. 1, what counts is not the energy of the electromagnetic waves but the
<br />
pattern of their spatial distribution. This is the prototype of
<br />
information-based interactions that involves information extraction: it is a
<br />
fundamental element in the interaction of any organism with the environment.
<br />
The electromagnetic waves emitted by the obstacle and detected by the dog's
<br />
sensors are signals. In this article we shall distinguish clearly between
<br />
&quot;signals&quot; and &quot;messages&quot; (see example 5 below): thus defined, a signal has
<br />
neither purpose nor any information at its origin, it only becomes
<br />
information when it is detected and used (or deliberately discarded) by an
<br />
organism. Note that this class of interactions must evolve; they cannot
<br />
arise spontaneously in the abiotic world. As a matter of fact, Darwinian
<br />
evolution itself embodies a gradual, species-specific information extraction
<br />
from the environment (see section 4). Another example would be that of a
<br />
geologist's brain processing the visual image of the rock's footprint from
<br />
example 2 above.
<br />
<p>4.	An ant leaving a scent mark along its path. This is the reverse process
<br />
of the preceding example, in which information is deposited in the
<br />
environment for later use. The sender has a specific purpose and information
<br />
is involved. At the other end of the interaction (the path) only physical
<br />
(chemical) processes are at work (but later, another ant may eventually
<br />
extract information from these physical signals). This is an example of
<br />
deliberate environmental modification with a purpose. Writing an article is
<br />
another.
<br />
<p>5.      A person talking to another. Here clearly we have information
<br />
processes and purpose at both ends of the interactive link. The
<br />
corresponding acoustical waves carry a message; what counts in this
<br />
interaction is not the energy but the acoustical patterns. To function, a
<br />
common code must exist at both ends (see next section). The interactive
<br />
process is a prototype of communication. In principle, we can think of this
<br />
prototype as a succession of types 4 and 3, in that order.
<br />
<p>Further on in the text, I will add the following remark:
<br />
<p>&quot;&quot;Concerning the interaction mechanism per se, there can be information
<br />
processing at the sender's end (example 4, section 1), at the recipient's
<br />
end (example 3) or at both ends (example 5). In all cases (excuse the purely
<br />
anthropomorphic language!) an accord, a common code must exist between
<br />
sender and recipient so that an interaction can take place (more on this in
<br />
section 4). Indeed, example 3 (section 1) requires the evolution of a
<br />
sensory apparatus able to detect and interpret the presence of the obstacle;
<br />
example 4 requires the existence of other ants that will respond to the
<br />
scent marks, and example 5 requires a common language.
<br />
