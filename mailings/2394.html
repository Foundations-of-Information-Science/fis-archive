                    &nbsp;Dear all,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Can't we just consider ethics as a glue of the society as a system. If to
                    <br />
                    look for an analogue in non-social domains, then any action from inside or
                    <br />
                    outside the system disrupting the system is &quot;unethical&quot; from perspective of
                    <br />
                    that very system. Thus eating proteins is &quot;unethical&quot; from perspective of
                    <br />
                    proteins, because its an end to their existence :-). Behaviour of cancer
                    <br />
                    cells might be conisdered unethical from a viewpoint of an entire organism.
                    <br />
                    In a same way criminal or unethical behavior of members in our societies
                    <br />
                    lead to social, economical and psychological problems like insecure or
                    <br />
                    unsafe environment, distrust leading to disintegration of social bonds, etc.
                    <br />
                    As a system, society has means (analog to immune system) to get rid of an
                    <br />
                    unethical&quot; elements by isolating or disintegrating them - which may seem
                    <br />
                    unethical&quot; from a standpoint of those elements... Still, when &quot;unethical&quot;
                    <br />
                    elements start to prevail, society either changes to some other form of
                    <br />
                    existence (history, history!..), or disintegrates and then bond again to a
                    <br />
                    new form/structure of society, because elements may not be able to exist if
                    <br />
                    they are not parts of something ensuring the quality of their existence...

                    Dear Jerry and all,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Morality is a (human) fact, not different from, say, the existence of
                    <br />
                    chemical reactions that follow special 'rules'. We say in German that
                    <br />
                    Chemistry works&quot; (&quot;die Chemie stimmt&quot;) when we spontaneously make
                    <br />
                    friends/make love (See also Goethe's &quot;Wahlverwandschaften&quot;).
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Of course, I am not saying that the specifity of moral imperatives can be
                    <br />
                    deduced from natural phenomena whatsoever. I am just 'justifying' the
                    <br />
                    existence of a specific form of human reflection called ethics that has to
                    <br />
                    do explicitly with the moral phenomenon, I.e. With norms and values that
                    <br />
                    rule human action in a specific community.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    These norms and values can be descriptive analyzed (no different in
                    <br />
                    principle as when you analyze a chemical substance and its reactions with
                    <br />
                    other ones), what we call &quot;descriptive ethics.&quot;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    We distinguish it from a &quot;normative ethics&quot; in which we tentatively analize
                    <br />
                    the form and content of such systems of morals in order to justify/change
                    <br />
                    them (or not) and so in order to give ourselves reasons for our actions.
                    <br />
                    That we are able to give ourselves reasons for our actions, I.e. That we do
                    <br />
                    not just act according to &quot;unchangable&quot; laws of nature but that we are open
                    <br />
                    to possibilities of action makes the specificity of human action and its
                    <br />
                    moral&quot; character.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    In case these possibilities take place within the context of modern digital
                    <br />
                    communication (Internet and the like) we speak of &quot;information ethics&quot;
                    <br />
                    (similarly to &quot;medical ethics&quot; in the case of situations in which the
                    <br />
                    physician/patient/society are involved regarding health). In other words, we
                    <br />
                    ask for an ethical foundation of our decisions within a digital
                    <br />
                    communication environment. But in a broader sense, we can say that
                    <br />
                    information ethics' deals with norms and values of (human) communication in
                    <br />
                    different media. In this sense we speak for instance of library ethics,
                    <br />
                    (mass) media ethics etc. Of course, the ethics of scientific communication
                    <br />
                    belong to information ethics to, concerning not only, for instance,
                    <br />
                    plagiarism, but the very idea of sharing our (scientific) ideas with others
                    <br />
                    (which include some kind of &quot;communism of ideas&quot; that interferes sometimes
                    <br />
                    with the (moral/legal) rules of, say, copyright regime(S).
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    The question you state about the genesis of moral (not ethical!) behavior is
                    <br />
                    a key issue in ethical thinking for centuries (I say: moral behaviour,
                    <br />
                    because this is the phenomenon we want to study, &quot;ethical behavior&quot; being
                    <br />
                    the reflection upon it: the question about the genesis of &quot;ethical behavior&quot;
                    <br />
                    is not (basically) different from the question of any other kind of
                    <br />
                    scientific behavior&quot;: why do we do science? For pragmatical (survival)
                    <br />
                    purposes? For the seek of truth? ... In the case of ethics as reflection of
                    <br />
                    morality, we start with this kind of reflection whe we have problems with
                    <br />
                    moral rules. Ethics is a symptom. But this is a broad field of study that I
                    <br />
                    cannot deal with now).
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    So, what is the genesis of moral behavior? Why do we &quot;feel&quot; obliged to do
                    <br />
                    the good? Is this the right question to start with? (as you see I am asking
                    <br />
                    now two different kinds a questions, an ethical and a &quot;metaethical&quot;
                    <br />
                    (linguistic) one). We can start with the &quot;fact&quot; of human will (this is what
                    <br />
                    Kant and Schopenhauer...) do, by saying that reflection (ethics) is not a
                    <br />
                    (enough) motivation for moral action (as intellectualists believe). Kant
                    <br />
                    believed that human reason (seeking vor universal laws) is not only of
                    <br />
                    theoretical but also of practical kind. Given the fact (!) that we are
                    <br />
                    capable of doing science (I.e. Of looking for the universal) means, when we
                    <br />
                    reflect it upon our actions, that we are &quot;compelled&quot; to act also
                    <br />
                    universallistically&quot; which is what Kant calls, as you know, the categorical
                    <br />
                    imperative. How does this idea of universality (or of the formality of the
                    <br />
                    categorical imperative) fits with the &quot;locality&quot; of moral systems/norms and
                    <br />
                    their evolution? And how do we &quot;apply&quot; the Kantian rule to specific
                    <br />
                    situations?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Today we are maybe less Kantians as we think because our belief in human
                    <br />
                    reason and its universality is not so strong as two centuries ago. We have
                    <br />
                    some good reasons (theoretial and historical ones) for being sceptical about
                    <br />
                    it.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    But not only this, we have in the field of ethics other traditions than
                    <br />
                    Western one which makes us more &quot;humble&quot; with regards to our foundational
                    <br />
                    ambitions. In a way, this is less a negative aspect as a positive one
                    <br />
                    because it shows is the openness of human cultural evolution and the kind of
                    <br />
                    ethical &quot;indeterminacy&quot; of human reason. But why should our action and its
                    <br />
                    foundation be less complex than, say, the life of a molecule?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Another (older) (Western) tradition of ethics states that the task of ethics
                    <br />
                    is not primarily the fundation of morals but the &quot;design&quot; of good life (ars
                    <br />
                    vitae). What we try to reflect in the information field is the idea (the
                    <br />
                    ideas) of what this means in the beginning century. This kind of ethical
                    <br />
                    thinking is less &quot;normative&quot; and more &quot;optional&quot;.
