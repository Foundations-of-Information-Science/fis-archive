<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear FISers,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analyzed), have reminded me the discussion about music and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would appreciate a lot to know your opinions about the *meaning of

These are a few of the things that keep me awake at night.
<br />
<p>So here is the perspective of a modern semiotician interested in the 
<br />
foundations of such questions.
<br />
<p>Meaning is the experience of the trace of experience left by a sign - 
<br />
where a sign is the individuated experience of a mark.  All individuated 
<br />
experiences are signs.  The subjects of signs are marks.  Marks are 
<br />
either natural marks arising from nature or metaphysical marks arising 
<br />
from intent.
<br />
<p>A definition is the meaning / sign pair.   Only by the assembled set of 
<br />
definitions embodied by the organism can it distinguish between signs 
<br />
whose subjects are natural marks and signs whose subjects are 
<br />
metaphysical marks.
<br />
<p>If you care about such things you might look at it this way:  imagine 
<br />
the embodied set of meanings as a complex vector space where each state 
<br />
vector represents a trace of experience, imagine each sign as existing 
<br />
in a similar complementary space.
<br />
<p>So, in this generalization it really does not matter if we are speaking 
<br />
of music, painting, or theatre.  Equally it does not matter if we speak 
<br />
of the marks of literature, science or the stars.
<br />
<p>The distinguishing factors are the nature of meaning synthesis that the 
<br />
marks undertake in the organism and the learning of convention that 
<br />
surrounds them. There are two forms of meaning synthesis, formal 
<br />
synthesis and intuitive synthesis. 
<br />
<p>[As an aside, to see how this works consider the difference between 
<br />
astronomers and astrologers.]
<br />
<p>So, to answer your question directly I will cast it so:  How does an 
<br />
organism distinguish between the music of Beethoven and the song of a 
<br />
lark?   And depending on the nature of the organism the answer is it can 
<br />
or it cannot.
<br />
<p>A member of our species that is newly born cannot distinguish the two 
<br />
because it has not yet learned the formal conventions that allow it to.  
<br />
It will treat the birdsong and Beethoven in precisely the same way.
<br />
<p>Now, the question of communication extends from this model. Is it 
<br />
correct to say that music as a form of communication has a meaning?
<br />
<p>It is. But again the question is no different than that which relates to 
<br />
communication in general.  The distinguishing factor between the 
<br />
metaphysical marks left by artists and those left by scientists is the 
<br />
intent - where intent is the meaning state evoked within the creator of 
<br />
the mark in the creation process (which I call semiosis).  
<br />
<p>Does it make sense to say &quot;What did Beethoven intent in his fifth 
<br />
symphony?&quot;  Only if you are interested in Beethoven's internal 
<br />
processes, but not otherwise.
<br />
<p>Artists, in general, are nature's provocateurs. We often use ambiguity 
<br />
to provoke questions and challenge convention.  Scientists, by contrast, 
<br />
seek to establish convention.  We do so to enable reliable communication 
<br />
of knowledge about the world.
<br />
<p>Your next question should relate to the notion of &quot;truth.&quot; :)
<br />
<p>The answer to that question and background to my particular work can be 
<br />
found at: <a href="../../www.what-it-all-means.com/default.htm">http://www.what-it-all-means.com</a>
<br />
<p>Since I anticipate the question I will answer it here.  Truth is an 
<br />
experience.  It is the map between what we know (our experience-of our 
<br />
embodied complex vector space of meaning) and the way things are.  Can 
<br />
we communicate truth by any means?  Beethoven or Einstein?  No.  Each of 
<br />
us must individually undertake the labor to construct an internal 
<br />
definition set that can enable that rare experience.  There is, 
<br />
after-all, no royal road to geometry.
<br />
<p>With respect,
<br />
Steven
<br />
