Dear colleague,
<br />
<p>An International Conference on Systems Thinking Globally Concerned BAC 2001
<br />
occurred November 1-4, 2001 in Technische Universität Wien, Vienna, Austria
<br />
as a culmination of actions carried out in order to celebrate the 100th
<br />
Anniversary of Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy's Birthday,
<br />
<p>You have participated in this event or expressed some weeks ago your
<br />
interest to attend it or at least you heard that it would happen
<br />
<p>After few days of unavoidably being motivated to reflect upon some
<br />
controversial aspects that emerged (though not always explicitly enough)
<br />
during the manifestation of this conference, it seems convenient to examine
<br />
what was finally accomplished. But it is not an easy task due to
<br />
multifarious assumptions, interpretations and even criticisms that were
<br />
only partially expressed.
<br />
<p>Before unilaterally trying to identify what inevitably would be a biased
<br />
judgement it seems better and even necessary to recapitulate what were the
<br />
original intentions which, one way or another, generated interest to
<br />
participate in order to debate the merits and failures in Bertalanffy's
<br />
work, and also to explore a few other advances of systems thinking derived
<br />
from his heritage or independently.
<br />
<p>The Conference was on one side the culmination of exchanges of views about
<br />
seven main subjects, that were assumed could be considered some of the main
<br />
Bertalanffy's concerns, which due to various  causes have become very
<br />
urgent questions to deal with - at the dawn of one 3rd millennium.
<br />
<p>The main original intention was to recognize once again that Bertalanffy,
<br />
more than three decades ago, identified some sources of the causality that
<br />
has generated numerous and always larger problems which altogether, in the
<br />
year 2001, are clearly recognized as the worst crisis ever faced by
<br />
humankind. Today, it is already urgently indispensable to create, in our
<br />
magnificent but also incongruous homosphere, radically new  cultural
<br />
circumstances and social conditions for helping all humans, one way or
<br />
another but humanely,  to create in every society  a New Image of Man and
<br />
Woman that may propitiate the gradual integration of a very new HUMANELY
<br />
minded Anthropology. This new conception of man is necessary because most
<br />
humans are increasingly facing the danger of being decerebralized through
<br />
all kinds of technologies invented in order to convert masses of people
<br />
into happy automatons that will 'behave' in the ways prescribed by the
<br />
industrial-military-political establishment as f it were the scientific
<br />
culmination of many different kinds of empiric actions, carried out during
<br />
the last civilizing millennia, in order to use the common people as slaves,
<br />
serfs, servants, lackeys, workers, soldiers,... human resources for
<br />
building one civilization after another that had unexpectedly collapsed.
<br />
<p>This New IMAGE is needed for encouraging everywhere the emergence of humans
<br />
learning to individually develop their personalities - in accordance with
<br />
ethical, ethological, biological and ecological criteria - for building a
<br />
WAY FORWARD for humankind towards the Creation of a Sustainable Society.
<br />
From now onward, this is the main challenge for humans who voluntarily
<br />
accept to play a responsible role on the Earth, willing to learn to be
<br />
conscious enough of the terrestrial possibilities that make possible to
<br />
design, implement and maintain human purposes, and to be sufficiently aware
<br />
not only of the fact that these possibilities are not granted forever, but
<br />
firstly for recognizing the growing tragedy that is causing the impact of
<br />
civilizing actions on the Ecosphere, where it is located the Biosphere that
<br />
until today, but certainly not tomorrow, has supported the anarchistic
<br />
aggrandizement and nonsensical expansion of one homosphere where billions
<br />
of human resources are employed for sustaining a civilized way of life that
<br />
has become, during the 20th century, frankly unsustainable, due mainly to
<br />
the growing number of people living in miserable conditions.
<br />
<p>The possible collapse of the whole civilization will unavoidably become
<br />
soon a real perspective, unless humans reverse the trends of the prevailing
<br />
civilization through a very new Entrepreneurship Spirit that may emerge
<br />
from Business based on Bertalanffy's General Systems Weltanschauung;
<br />
complemented by public services engaged in rebuilding a new homosphere
<br />
where decision makers and common people must cooperatively and effectively
<br />
contribute to deal with the global problems: unemployment, emigration,
<br />
misery, hunger, starvation, drug-addiction, modern slavery, sexual abuse of
<br />
children and women, transplantation of organs of people that were condemned
<br />
to death... which altogether are the causes of a very quick disruption of
<br />
civilizing requirements. and degeneration of the dynamical features of
<br />
intended civilizing processes.
<br />
<p>The crisis that humankind faces at present, which is de facto the extreme
<br />
degradation of the human conditions engendered by the colonization that
<br />
started 500 centuries ago has been very seriously aggravated in this year
<br />
2001 by the reaction of some gentlemen (comprised ladies and dames who keep
<br />
supporting the men's performances) that have decided to use the
<br />
super-modernized warfare in order to eliminate all the terrorists who
<br />
presumably have made up their mind in order to re-create the conditions for
<br />
a ritual purification of patriarchal societies. The warfare that has
<br />
determined the sanguinary course of the whole civilization from its very
<br />
beginnings continues being the stimuli that increases the depravity of
<br />
modern strategists searching how to develop new and more effective
<br />
chemical, biological, nuclear,... weapons for destroying the enemies of the
<br />
human society, but these enemies are already inside the human society.
<br />
Peace Research as a particular application of general systems thinking is
<br />
the option that may widen the views of responsible scholars in their search
<br />
to comprehend the dynamics of conflicts, aggresiveness and eventually wars
<br />
in order to cooperatively cope with them.
