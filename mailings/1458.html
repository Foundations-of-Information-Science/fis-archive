My Dear Colleagues,
<br />
<p>Sent again: edited a little bit for long lines. Because I am busy with
<br />
other business, I will be silent for very long time. Thanks!
<br />
<p>Resent to FIS list. Sent at 4/22/2004 11:25 PM
<br />
<p>Dear Loet,
<br />
<p>1. Information (or entropy) can be the same whether we
<br />
paint black ink on white paper or put white paint on a black paper
<br />
and they might even have nothing to do with symmetry. Is this what
<br />
you mean when you say (1,1,2,2,3,3) or (3,3,2,2,1,1) or other kinds of
<br />
data array are the same value of entropy (or information)?
<br />
<p>Symmetry has been a math concept. However, I can quickly find many
<br />
facts that symmetric structures are more stable than other structures.
<br />
This observation may suggest that higher symmetry may imply higher
<br />
entropy and (less information) for a static structure which has
<br />
certain geometry. One example is the state when the pressure P is
<br />
the same on two parts of a gas chambers separated by a wall. The
<br />
symmetric state is the state where P is the same on both sides.
<br />
Then, the thermodynamic entropy is also the highest when P is the same.
<br />
I can give you many other examples in thermodynamics and in mechanics.
<br />
<p>2. All observed facts from many examples show that constraints define
<br />
a static structure (even for fluids). If there are some structures which
<br />
can be made more symmetric, there is information in these structures
<br />
which can be reduced. An example, again, is the ideal gas in two parts.
<br />
<p>If there are a series of static structures (with different symmetries)
<br />
with the entropy S and their energy (E) values different, we can plot
<br />
S - E (S is x axis, E is y axis). The slope is called temperature.
<br />
In thermodynamics E=kT(S)+F. Because slope can be negative, therefore,
<br />
temperature T can be negative. For a gas, heat it with increase both
<br />
E and S, therefore T is positive.
<br />
<p>3. Sometimes, it is not necessary to introduce new concepts. For instance,
<br />
when we plot S - E (S is x axis, E is y axis), the x axis can be
<br />
information (I). I agree with you that here, that &quot;half empty&quot; and
<br />
&quot;half full&quot; are the same meaning.
<br />
<p>However, as I pointed out, the introduction of &quot;symmetry&quot; concept
<br />
into our information consideration is useful because it can be
<br />
connected to stability. &quot;Symmetry&quot; is a preferred concept because it
<br />
has been a mathematical representation of (geometric) structures.
<br />
<p>Not only the well known symmetry concept itself is introduced. More
<br />
concepts can be introduced:
<br />
<p>---Because (static) information is accepted, if its loss is defined as
<br />
entropy, we can introduce &quot;static entropy&quot; concept. &quot;Static entropy&quot;
<br />
is not thermodynamic entropy, it is better to add &quot;static&quot; before
<br />
entropy.
<br />
<p>Therefore, we have two sets of concepts:
<br />
static symmetry, static entropy, etc. and
<br />
dynamic symmetry, (dynamic) entropy, etc.
<br />
for us to characterize two kinds of systems or structures and their
<br />
stabilities.
<br />
<p>---Because for some mechanical systems when energy is lower,
<br />
the symmetry (and S) is higher, for a series of structures, a
<br />
graphics of S - E (S is x axis, E is y axis) can be produced where the
<br />
slope can be found as negative. Therefore, we have a negative
<br />
temperature, well defined as the slope. Of course this is not measured
<br />
by a thermometer and it is not a thermodynamic temperature.
<br />
<p>Both symmetry and entropy are macroscopic measure. They can be
<br />
calculated from the microscopic states which care statistically
<br />
(probabilistically) distributed. The mixing of many microscopic states
<br />
(microstates) define the macroscopic homogeneity or macroscopic
<br />
isotropicity, etc., all are symmetries for a dynamic system. How many
<br />
microstates? If it is denoted by w, logw is entropy. This w can be
<br />
called symmetry number, for a dynamic system.
<br />
<p>By the way, please pay attention to our journal ENTROPY where the very
<br />
first full paper is on the topic of temperature, see:
<br />
<a href="../../www.mdpi.net/entropy/list99.htm">http://www.mdpi.net/entropy/list99.htm</a> or more specifically the
<br />
pdf file at the <a href="../../www.mdpi.net/entropy/papers/e1010004.pdf">http://www.mdpi.net/entropy/papers/e1010004.pdf</a>
<br />
address.
<br />
<p>Finally, I also agree with you that, while entropy is only a number,
<br />
symmetry in the form of group theory and matrix algebra can give a
<br />
more detailed description of the structure. However, a symmetry
<br />
number is enough to define relative stability.
<br />
<p>Shannon's H (or Boltzmann's H) means information and also means
<br />
entropy. This makes discussion impossible in some cases. It is
<br />
better to use I for information , S for entropy. Transformation
<br />
between I and S is trivial (if we define L=S+I)
<br />
when we are talking about Shannon's H. However, we must get use to
<br />
such kind of definition of relations (kind of transformation). This
<br />
good habit can be very useful: if a set of raw data H is actually a
<br />
sinusoid H = sin t in a time (t) domain, a chart of 1000 km long is
<br />
not long enough to record it completely. This does not mean that this
<br />
H has a tremendous amount of information. Through a simple Fourier
<br />
transform (a kind of pattern recognition) we may find it as
<br />
a single pick in the frequency domain which can be recorded in a
<br />
small piece of paper. This very large amount of raw data can be
<br />
compressed into a small amount of data because of its periodicity of
<br />
the sinusoid, a kind of symmetry. Symmetry makes data compression
<br />
possible. That is why I prefer to define information (I) as the
<br />
compressed data.
<br />
<p><p>(Thanks, Guy!)

<p>Best regards,
<br />
Shu-Kun
