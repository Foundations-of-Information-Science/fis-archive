Professor of sociology Dirk Baecker, University of Witten/Herdecke, Germany:
<br />
<p>Abstract:
<br />
The lecture and seminar will cover more recent attempts to use a Spencer-Brownian notation of form for the analysis of choice, organization, and firm. The overall attempt will be to show what a model of social choice in distinction from a model of rational choice will look like. Some inferences regarding the behavior of firms and management will be undertaken.
<br />
<p>Dr Dirk Baecker studied sociology and economics at Köln and Paris, and did his philosophical dissertation (on markets) and his post-doctoral habilitation (on firms) with Prof Niklas Luhmann at the University of Bielefeld. His publications include Information und Risiko in der Marktwirtschaft (Frankfurt am Main 1988), Die Form des Unternehmens(Frankfurt am Main 1993), Wozu Systeme? (Berlin 2001), Form und Formen der Kommunikation (Frankfurt am Main 2005). He is editor of Problems of Form (Stanford, Cal., 1999). Homepage: <a href="../../homepage.mac.com/baecker/default.htm">http://homepage.mac.com/baecker/</a>
<br />
<p>Anders la Cour, assistant professor at CBS, will start the discussion by offering some critical remarks on Dr. Baecker's lecture.
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From 13:00 - 16:00
</em><br />
Professor of Philosophy and Semiotics John Deely at the University of St Thomas, Houston, and Executive Director of the Semiotic Society of America will speak about:
<br />
<p>Abstract
<br />
Semiotics and The four ages of Understanding: Why semiotics is foundational for a postmodern philosophy of knowledge&quot;. Professor Deely will talk about the manner in which semiotics transcends the realism/idealism opposition, which developed over the course of modernity, and in so doing establishes the beginning of a post-modern development within the overall history of philosophy.
<br />
<p><p>Professor was chosen by the SSA to be its first living Thomas A. Sebeok Fellow in 1993, awarded the first Mouton d'Or Award for the best essay published in the field by the journal Semiotica 1981, a second time in 2004 for his 2003 article The word semiotics: formation and origins. The first edition of his book, Basics of Semiotics, was published in 1991 and is now translated into ten languages, a fourth enlarged edition is published in English and Estonian in bilingual format. His major works are the 1985 critical bilingual edition of John Poinsot's 1632 Tractatus de Signis (University of California Press 1985) and his Four Ages of Understanding: The first postmodern survey of philosophy from ancient times to the turn of the 21st century (2001, University of Toronto Press) .
