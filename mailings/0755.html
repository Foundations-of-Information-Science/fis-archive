Dear FIS colleagues,
<br />
<p>Following the recent exchanges on 'Is information a disease?' I would like 
<br />
to add that the nervous system appears to be optimised for an environment 
<br />
with a predictable amount of sensory input. See the classic rat experiments 
<br />
--3 populations, &quot;nirvana&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;stressy&quot; environments, with 
<br />
luxurious, demanding and very overburdening surroundings. The animals in 
<br />
the cage with &quot;tasks of a middle complexity&quot; had the longest survival. With 
<br />
humans, sensory deprivation surroundings are a recognised form of torture.
<br />
<p>So, the nervous system is definitely prepared for a middle amount of 
<br />
changes in the surrounding space. This may go back to natural periodicities 
<br />
and the revolving quality of the Earth (that sometimes it is dark /cold/, 
<br />
sometimes sunny /warm/, imbedded into the succession of days, moon phases, 
<br />
seasons, etc). One may wonder whether it is conceivable that life ever 
<br />
evolved in a strictly stationary /stable/ surrounding. Indeed the basic 
<br />
pattern of life is based on periodicity and cyclicity.
<br />
<p>My contention --jumping to a theoretical science level-- is that we have to 
<br />
let loose the conceptualizations transported by our way of counting 
<br />
(1,2,3,...) because they carry in an implicit way of thinking that does not 
<br />
agree with biological phenomena. The ideas behind a basic assumption about 
<br />
the world that are implicit in counting like 1,2,3,... seem to be:
<br />
<p>-- all elements are alike in their basic unit (there is only one kind of basic
<br />
units),
<br />
-- the distance between elements is the same,
<br />
-- the increase from one element to the next is the same (the basic element),
<br />
-- there is no end in sight to this series,
<br />
-- there are no preferred sizes to elements,
<br />
-- there are no two basic kinds of elements that cooperate in the 
<br />
generation of a new element.
<br />
<p>Instead, one might try to explore the use of an improved way of counting. 
<br />
In that new way, one would count congruencies between two different ways of 
<br />
counting, both going back to the sequence 1,2,3,... By following this dual 
<br />
way of counting, we can engineer a system which:
<br />
<p>-- uses periodicities,
<br />
-- uses cyclicities,
<br />
-- does have preferred sizes,
<br />
-- does have several different elementary units,
<br />
-- has two basic realisations, that in their co-operation evolve a new system,
<br />
-- there is a conspicuous generation of variety in the system.
<br />
<p>The numbering system one uses impregnates one's ways of thinking very 
<br />
deeply. Then - so have we learnt - if you can rely on something to be 
<br />
actually true, then it is something we may publicly count. In fact, that is 
<br />
the etalon on which we gauge whether we think correctly. The fundamentals 
<br />
of our rational thinking go back to that basic counting ability which we 
<br />
have learnt at the age of 6 years: &quot;this is thinking&quot;. &quot;These are the rules 
<br />
how reasonable thinking happens&quot;. That style of thinking may be OK in 
<br />
numerous fields of learning, but not really suitable for the contemplation 
<br />
and representation of the living.
<br />
<p>So the task for FIS is - in my eyes - to build the new logico-philosophical
<br />
foundations necessary for a rationally enlarged discourse about biology (&amp; 
<br />
neurosciences) and the whole humanities. Just like the Encyclopaedists 
<br />
historically worked on a new catalogue of rational concepts...
<br />
<p>Karl
