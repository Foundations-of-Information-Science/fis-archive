                    Dear Stan and Gordana
                    <br />
                <p>When you talk information here are you thinking of Shannon or Wiener information? Or some logical
                    measure of structure and organization? Or do you include meaning?
                    <br />
                <p>Luhmann says that a message is consisting of meaning, information and the form of expression.
                    <br />
                <p>It makes sense to me that information is the quantitative and structural aspect of meaning and
                    intention.
                    <br />
                <p>But I see no way of measuring meaning. Luhmann talks of a surplus of possibilities of choice and
                    action, which, I do not find sufficient for instance to describe the meaning of a religious og
                    philosophical message about the meaning of suffering and love.
                    <br />
                <p>

                <p>Gordana --
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you Stan, that was precisely what I meant by my question.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exactly how to define informational content of things that can not be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;verbalized? (Maybe only because, as you say, our linguistics communities
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;have not conquered those rare territories such as dreams or music or
                        arts.)
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes as well poetry, which IS linguistic, but relies not so
                    <br />
                    much on denotation, but on numerous properties like rythm, aliteration,
                    <br />
                    rhyme, dissonance, assonance, and so on. As far as I can see, information
                    <br />
                    in language products refers only to denotation. I do suppose that changes
                    <br />
                    in rythm, the use of dissonance where one expects rhyme, and other breaks
                    <br />
                    in expectation might be treated as informational in the standard sense, but
                    <br />
                    this seems pretty weak.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;Those spheres of personal experiences we may hope will be explored in the
                    <br />
                    future, so that at least we may learn how the brain processes those things.
                    <br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; You said:
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, technically, I think information is just any constraint on our
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;activity. So, do dreams, and those scents and music that have not been
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;harnessed by society, constrain our actions? If not, are they
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;informational? Some information is associated to meaning by semiosis.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if dreams, fragrances and music are not information, we know
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;nevertheless that they are meaningful to us personally. So, can meaning
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist aside from information? 
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; My feeling is that in dreams informational content of our brains gets
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;re-structured, or re-connected in different ways. Dreams contain elements
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;from real life memories, but they are differently related, distorted,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;intensified, etc. So I guess dreams have definitely informational content.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense of breaking the expected, perhaps so. However, I am
                    <br />
                    particularly intrigued by these feelings that are entirely unique, never
                    <br />
                    being experienced in the waking world, and never repeated (and so only
                    <br />
                    barely remembered) in the dream world either. These must arise from unique
                    <br />
                    configurations of neuronal propagations. It has been noted that unique
                    <br />
                    configurations confront us all the time every day. Every situation is to
                    <br />
                    some degree different from any other, but, of course, we do not focus upon
                    <br />
                    this, rather on what is common between instances, and so, by way of
                    <br />
                    classifying, we feel we understand what is happening. And this approach is
                    <br />
                    fundamental to science. Here meaningfulness seems to associate with
                    <br />
                    commonality.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One more interesting aspect of the problem is the approximate thinking.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;We have a feeling  if something is OK or not. Very often experts have a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;feeling . Their expertise can be verbalized up to the point, but after
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that, there is a feeling   what is just the right amount of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;something, the right measure, the right thing to do in certain situation.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Those feelings  also have informative content, as they definitely
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;constrain our activity.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this -- intuition -- is very important in daily life. And,
                    <br />
                    indeed, it does constrain our actions. But I think that we cannot
                    <br />
                    necessarily assign conventional meanings to intuitions, and so this raises
                    <br />
                    the problem of what is 'meaning' in semiotics. As a pansemiotician, I
                    <br />
                    think that if an intuition constrains our action, then it must be
                    <br />
                    meaningful. I am sure those strange dream feelings, if I felt them in some
                    <br />
                    waking context, would definitely influence my action, and so they would
                    <br />
                    have to be classified as potentially having meaning. But then their
                    <br />
                    meaning might be assigned by way of which action they invited. But that
                    <br />
                    would completely lose the importance they appear to have experientially.
                    <br />
                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any event, I do have a feeling :-) that meaning and information are
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;so tightly bound that anything having meaning must be possible to express
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;in terms of information.
                    </em><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. But note the last example I just gave. Here a rich experience
                    <br />
                    might impell me to step to the right instead of to the left, and so may
                    <br />
                    save my life from a falling object. If we express its meaning in terms of
                    <br />
                    this important result, I think we would miss the greater part of its
                    <br />
                    richness, which, then would be meaningless!

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;differently?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;May I say that meaning  of music for me as a subject is the result of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the difference that made the difference in my physical structures,

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;This raises what has been for me an issue of some interest. I associate
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;some kinds of meaning with emotion. Our culture invites only a certain
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;limited range of emotions. We can get an idea of how small a range this is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;by paying attention to the emotional content of dreams -- actually more
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting that the images. Here we experience emotions that are never
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;elicited in everyday life, and that are, indeed, indescribable and unique.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;They are as indescribable as the scents of many of the various essential
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;oils taken from plants. Some of these associate with numinous feelings, as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;with encense (frankincense, olibanum) or Peru balsam, which have been
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;smudged in (at least) churches and synagogues for centuries. But many (for
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;us) float free of any particular association, as they have not been
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;harnessed by our society. Are these 'untamed' fragrances -- and those
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;dream emotions -- meaningless? This brings me to music. I now listen
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;largely to Romantic keyboard music -- Schubert (the father of musical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;Romanticism), Chopin (The soul of Romantic music) and Schumann (the spirit
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Romantic music). It seems clear to me that these artists have INVENTED
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain emotions that literally did not exist prior to their discovery on
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;the keyboard in the Nineteenth Century. Now, these emotions are also
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;indescribable, but in this case it is clear that they can be (have been)
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;shared by many persons in the experience of art. But, do we all agree as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the 'meanings' of these passages? We don't really know, do we? It
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems likely that neurologists might be able to discover some general
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;shared responses to them elicited in us during experiments, but would
                        these
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;be 'describable' (translatable to language)?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, technically, I think information is just any constraint on our
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;activity. So, do dreams, and those scents and music that have not been
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;harnessed by society, constrain our actions? If not, are they
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;informational? Some information is associated to meaning by semiosis. But
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;if dreams, fragrances and music are not information, we know nevertheless
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;that they are meaningful to us personally. So, can meaning exist aside
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;from information?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;STAN
                    </em><br />
