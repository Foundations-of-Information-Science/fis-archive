<p>
The four volume-set on Systems Thinking that will be published by 
<br />
Sage in February 2003, being presented &quot;as a resource for future 
<br />
generations of students and systems practitioners&quot;, has been 
<br />
announced arguing that &quot;(t)hey will be especially valuable for 
<br />
libraries that do not have extensive collections of systems journals&quot; 
<br />
because &quot;this collection is really too expensive [£450 (UK Pounds)] 
<br />
for individuals to purchase&quot;. In addition it is claimed and claiming 
<br />
that these books &quot;ensure that a wide range of systems ideas are made 
<br />
accessible to both new readers and those wanting to broaden their 
<br />
knowledge of the systems field.available&quot;
<br />
<p>Reading the titles of the 76 papers chosen for being published, it 
<br />
might be once again corroborated that the evolvement of systems have 
<br />
been philosophically validated while cybernetics have been basically 
<br />
justified as a set of means for improving the functionality of 
<br />
certain systems. Besides it can be maintained that in both cases the 
<br />
betterment has made necessary to continuously develop their specific 
<br />
possibilities in diverse areas where critical circumstances, adaptive 
<br />
requirements, self-referential control, usefulness of communication,&#x160; 
<br />
emerged or became essential aspects of systemic actions supported by 
<br />
cybernetic interrelations presumably while bearing in mind that 
<br />
learning to deal with complex situations cause necessarily a peculiar 
<br />
proliferation of methodological approaches for tackling specific 
<br />
situations and problems that were considered top priorities.
<br />
<p>Besides it seems confirmed the conceptual validity of systems and 
<br />
cybernetic in a large variety of areas of human concern: from Gaia to 
<br />
Schizophrenia, Family Therapy including the Modelling, Simulation, 
<br />
Management and Betterment of Socio-technical Systems and the domain 
<br />
of Systems Engineering
<br />
<p>Therefore it could not be ignored that each one of the texts selected 
<br />
was originally written as a contribution for describing experiences 
<br />
attained and also for explaining, justifying and or implementing 
<br />
actions where the concepts of systems and cybernetics were or could 
<br />
be employed for dealing with the technologically oriented and 
<br />
methodologically minded evolvement of the human society that has 
<br />
emerged in the frame of the western civilization. Today only this 
<br />
civilizing concern is what prevails, though under the influence of 
<br />
many diverse religious and ideological interpretations of what the 
<br />
human reality might be.
<br />
<p>Anyhow these 76 texts constitute a sample of the kinds of ideas that 
<br />
during the last five decades were conceived in diverse circumstances 
<br />
by researchers who have intended, according to their personal 
<br />
possibilities and engagements to deal more consistently - supported 
<br />
by systems and cybernetic concepts - with some of the increasing 
<br />
number of larger difficulties that have generated the dynamics of the 
<br />
Western civilization.
<br />
<p>In general, it can be argued that most systems thinkers and 
<br />
cyberneticians, necessarily conditioned each one by his or her 
<br />
perceptual possibilities and under the influence of his or her biased 
<br />
interpretations of the reality, unavoidably perceived peculiarly by 
<br />
every individual - though without being able to avoid completely the 
<br />
pressure of his or her own prejudices - almost always, has aimed in 
<br />
practice at making sustainable the functionality of some aspects of 
<br />
the civilized homosphere.
<br />
<p>It means that the conceptual value of systems thinking, comprised in 
<br />
several cases the insertion of cybernetic interactions, which have 
<br />
been mainly produced along the second half of the 20th century (after 
<br />
their explicit emergence and diffusion), have been determined by 
<br />
individuals learning to accept and to criticize some of the features 
<br />
of this civilized homosphere, while disregarding and ignoring other 
<br />
characteristics.
<br />
<p>But the functioning of every constituted society, at the dawn of one 
<br />
conventional 3rd millennium, is confronted today to an increasing 
<br />
poverty, misery, unemployment, hunger, starvation, pollution of 
<br />
water, soil and air, exhaustive explotation of natural resources, 
<br />
criminality, economic, social and ethnical discrimination, extended 
<br />
xenophobia, violent supression of conflicts,&#x160; Meanwhile systems are 
<br />
created for increasing monetary profits and financial revenues, for 
<br />
legal and illegal (globalised and globalising) trade and even for 
<br />
fighting against and killing all the other humans who refuse to 
<br />
accept and recognize that the progress of the whole civilization is 
<br />
under way because rich people become soon wealthier in order to 
<br />
evolve as philanthropists.
<br />
<p>&quot;Components of contemporary change... At the top is the spectacular 
<br />
advance of human misery. I estimate that more humans are enduring 
<br />
agony today than ever before.. I speak of starvation and epidemic; 
<br />
war and terrorism; deprivation, exploitation, and physical torture... 
<br />
Second is the collapse of the civilization, which we have known in 
<br />
our lifetime. ...no one talks about the exploitation of either nature 
<br />
or indigenous people any more. They talk instead about 'sustainable 
<br />
development' --but there is not such thing. Not only can development 
<br />
not be sustained; even the existing fabric cannot be sustained any 
<br />
longer. ...we are governed by an oligarchy --by the few; it is an 
<br />
oligarchy of power greed, and terror. ...we are blind to this. 
<br />
...none of the phenomena mentioned would be observed in its current 
<br />
and virulent form, if there were no powerful modern armaments... But 
<br />
no serious political platform anywhere has proposed to make the 
<br />
manufacture of armaments illegal. ...this manufacture is essential to 
<br />
the conduct of the existing world economy. Without jumping to 
<br />
conspiracy theories, or citing the illegal activities which now 
<br />
constitute the world's biggest industry, we can at the least say that 
<br />
humankind now manages its own affairs with breathtaking incompetence&quot; 
<br />
[Beer, 1993, p. 15].

<p>[Beer, 1993] Stafford Beer. World in Torment: A time whose idea must 
<br />
come. Presidential Address to the Congress of the WOSC, New Delhi, 
<br />
1993) in Kybernetes Vol 22, No 6, 1993
<br />
<p>Evidently something or even many things have not worked properly 
<br />
inside the Systems Movement during only 48 years, since the Society 
<br />
for General Systems Research emerged in 1954. In this period of time 
<br />
the World has changed radically due to the successful implementation 
<br />
of many kinds of technological, methodological and organizational 
<br />
innovations. It has evidently changed a great deal - less for better 
<br />
and a lot more for worse - but allowing for a gross simplification, 
<br />
improvements attained for example in the domain of human and animals 
<br />
rights, are rarely due to systems thinking and cybernetic ideas, 
<br />
while the deterioration of human circumstances is efficiently 
<br />
organized by means of societal systems constituted for the sake of 
<br />
civilization.
<br />
<p>However tragic the perspective generated by the civilizing dynamics 
<br />
that has been imposed to humankind, it is claimed that there is still 
<br />
possible to build a way forward - one that may lead humans to 
<br />
overwhelm the crisis aggravated along the last century by the 
<br />
prevalent decision making - if and only if humans learn to comprehend 
<br />
and transform differently their surrounding reality.
<br />
<p>Such a way forward may arise from the debate about the possibilities 
<br />
that may offer the Systems Thinking, through Top Ë Down approach, as 
<br />
it was proposed by Ludwig von Bertalanffy: This approach has been 
<br />
very often put aside due to the assumption that analytic procedures 
<br />
are more reliable than holistic endeavors without being recognized
<br />
<p>However tragic the perspective generated by the civilizing dynamics 
<br />
that has been imposed to humankind since around only eight millennia 
<br />
ago, it is claimed in the year 2002 that there are nowadays enough 
<br />
minds on Earth willing to examine and develop the planetary 
<br />
possibilities needed for building gradually and consistently a way 
<br />
forward that may lead humans to overwhelm the actual crisis, which 
<br />
has been aggravated along the last century by the prevalent decision 
<br />
making. Such a kind of possibilities may arise explicitly if and only 
<br />
if humans learn to comprehend and transform differently their 
<br />
surrounding reality.
<br />
<p>Such a way forward may emerge from the debate about the possibilities 
<br />
that may offer the Systems Thinking, through Top Ë Down approach, as 
<br />
it was proposed by Ludwig von Bertalanffy: This approach has been 
<br />
very often put aside due to the assumption that analytic procedures 
<br />
cannot be substituted by holistic endeavors, which are in fact 
<br />
indispensable for searching effectively how to make sustainable the 
<br />
presence of humans in time and in space in the only planet available 
<br />
for us.
