<p>Dear Edwina
<br />
<p>If all objects are signs and all signs are objects then I cannot see how the difference between representamen and object can be upheld. Then the triadic sign collapses. There must be a dynamical object  &quot;out there&quot;  (that is not a sign) that the sign through semiosis and the evolution in the semiotic web moves towards or else the truth concept will disappear. This is my concern.
<br />
<p>I would like to refer you all to Winfried Nöth's article on &quot;Semiotic Machines&quot; in Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing v. 9 no. 1 where he very carefully deals with Peirce's understanding of the protosemiotic.

In reply to Heiner Benking, and his outline of the index - yes, Peirce
<br />
was a surveyor and the indexical action of 'pointing to' was a vital
<br />
relation.
<br />
<p>The way I see the triadic sign, is that it is made up of relations.
<br />
The sign is a 'developing spatiotemporal entity' (whether as an atom,
<br />
a molecule, a cell, an organism, a word, a thought). This means that
<br />
it is an action-of-becoming-a-being'. So, it exists both within active
<br />
relations and a certain amount of closure and inertia. This inertia
<br />
can last for a nanosecond or a century. It is maintained by relations.
<br />
There are three relations: (1) the sign (think of the sign as
<br />
matter/energy becoming 'cooled' or 'solidified')..in relation to
<br />
another mass (an external object). This relation between one form of
<br />
matter/energy and another form of matter/energy....leads to that
<br />
clarification or distinctiveness of both forms of matter/energy.  (2)
<br />
The sign as it is becoming more discrete...as it is interpreted.   And
<br />
(3) the sign-in-itself.
<br />
<p>I know this seems complicated - but you can visualize this triad like
<br />
this   \ . /
<br />
Notice the 'dot' in between. That's the sign-in-itself (Representamen)
<br />
The \ line is the relation that the Sign has with an external Object
<br />
(iconic, indexical, symbolic)
<br />
The / line is the relation the Sign has as it is interpreted
<br />
(rhematic, dicent, argument). This simply outlines 'how' the first
<br />
relation (with the object) is interpreted.
<br />
<p>If you consider all three interactions as relations - well, I think
<br />
that's a clear sense of the sign as a dynamic action. I view these
<br />
interactions as predicates.
<br />
The indexical predicate is very important. There are two types. The
<br />
'pointing to' predicate is what I refer to as
<br />
'Secondness-as-Firstness' (2-1). This means that you have
<br />
matter/energy in an anticipatory state, a mode of 'in -betweenness';
<br />
it's a decision-making action...not quite clear and still fuzzy.
<br />
Peirce referred to it as the zone of precission.
<br />
<p>In reply to Soren - who is concerned that &quot;all there is in the world
<br />
is signs and there are no objects to refer to&quot;. Well, I think that
<br />
this is true! All there is in the world is signs! But- a sign is also
<br />
an object. A sign acts as a Dynamic Object...and another Object,
<br />
interacts with that object..and because of this interaction, they are
<br />
both existent as 'signs'. I don't think that a sign exists only within
<br />
human descriptive operations. Signs are not just descriptions - A
<br />
description by a human is merely a 'Dynamic Interpretant'...and all it
<br />
can do is enable us to describe something else using a secondary
<br />
referential system (ie language). But interpretation is more complex..
<br />
A cell most certainly interprets the chemicals entering its
<br />
cell-space. The cell 'understands' these entering chemicals and thus,
<br />
the chemicals are 'signs'..as is the cell.
<br />
<p>And exactly as you say, 'what we call objects in physics is a
<br />
production of both firstness, secondness and thirdness'. Right.
<br />
<p>But- it isn't correct, I feel, to set up an 'either-or' scenario that
<br />
matter is either an object or a sign. A sign IS an object!..and an
<br />
object IS a sign!.  The object can't exist except if it is in relation
<br />
with other matter/energy. Because of those relations, it is enabled to
<br />
be an object (a discrete mass)..and because of those relations, it is
<br />
also a sign, ie, a mass-in-relations. That merges classical and
<br />
quantum field physics!
<br />
