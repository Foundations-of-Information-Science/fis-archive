                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Collegues!
                    <br />
                <p>During summer holidays we were involved in interesting debates on
                    <br />
                    Quantum and Classical Information Theories (which were tarnsformed
                    <br />
                    finally into a deep discussion on meaning of informartion and its reality).
                    <br />
                <p>I would like to present some concluding remarks. After this I propose
                    <br />
                    that everybody who is interested can send his own concluding remarks and
                    <br />
                    after that (may be in one--two weeks) session will be closed. I recall
                    <br />
                    my viewpoint:
                    <br />
                <p>We all work with models of reality. We cannot &lt;&lt;understand reality&gt;&gt;,
                    <br />
                    but only describe it by using this or that model. The most advanced way
                    <br />
                    of modeling of reality is mathematical modeling. Sometimes reality is
                    <br />
                    even identified with a mathematical model. This happened with the modern
                    <br />
                    picture of space-time reality which is based on using of real continuum.
                    <br />
                    I pointed out that there were attempts to propose alternative models of
                    <br />
                    reality even for space-time, e.g., p-adic models.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>There are two main mathematical models of information:
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>a). Classical thermodynamical model in that information is defined from
                    <br />
                    entropy and the latter is based on the Kolmogorov measure-theoretic
                    <br />
                    definition of probability.
                    <br />
                <p>b). Quantum information model in that information is defined by using
                    <br />
                    linear algebra (operator theory).
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Mathematical structures of models are different. In particular, QI is
                    <br />
                    noncommutative theory. The natural question arises:
                    <br />
                <p>&lt;&lt;Is it just difference in mathematical models, in mathematical
                    <br />
                    descriptions, so just different mathematical representations of the same
                    <br />
                    kind of reality or one should consider two extremely different types of
                    <br />
                    physical phenomena, classical and quantum?&gt;&gt;
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>The conventional point of view is that there are two extremely different
                    <br />
                    domains of physics, quantum and classical. The first one is about
                    <br />
                    microworld and the second is about macroworld. This is the Copenhagen
                    <br />
                    viewpoint: there are microscopic systems and macroscopic observers.
                    <br />
                    It induces many problems and paradoxes, but nevertheless it is
                    <br />
                    convenient in applications and it dominates in physics. One of the main
                    <br />
                    problems is the boundary between the quantum and classical domains.
                    <br />
                <p>In the quantum domain a system can be in a superposition of a few
                    <br />
                    different states. This is precisely why quantum computers should work
                    <br />
                    quicker than classical ones. In classical it could not. For example, as
                    <br />
                    was pointed by Roger Penrose, a single neuron could not be at the same
                    <br />
                    time in the superposition of two states: firing and nonfiring.
                    <br />
                <p>The famous Schrodinger cat was created by Schrrodinger to show
                    <br />
                    absurdness of Copenhagen interpretation. This example was proposed in
                    <br />
                    his letter to Einstein and it was a modification of an example from one
                    <br />
                    of Einsteins letters about pistolet and bomb. The main idea was that if
                    <br />
                    one assumes superposition of states for microscopic systems one would be
                    <br />
                    always able to lift this superposition to macroscopic systems.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>My point was that two information theories are based on two probability
                    <br />
                    theories: classical Kolmogorov measure-theoretic probability and quantum
                    <br />
                    von Neumann Hilbert space probability. In the second case we operate not
                    <br />
                    directly with probabilities but with complex probability amplitudes.
                    <br />
                <p>Some people think that quantum probability is more complicated than the
                    <br />
                    classical one. I do not think so. Theory of Lebesgues integral is
                    <br />
                    essentially deeper and more complicated from the mathematical viewpoint
                    <br />
                    than linear algebra, especially in finite dimensional spaces which are
                    <br />
                    used in quantum information theory.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>I am trying to sell the idea that the whole quantum enterprise is about
                    <br />
                    simplification of description of extremely complex physical phenomena.
                    <br />
                    I developed models in that the quantum probabilistic model appears as a
                    <br />
                    projection of more complex classical statistical model.
                    <br />
                <p>Then I proceed: Wau! In such a case it seems that quantum probability
                    <br />
                    theory and quantum information could be used everywhere where we could
                    <br />
                    not provide the complete description of phenomena and we just try to
                    <br />
                    create a simplified representation in complex Hilbert space.
                    <br />
                <p>So one can apply quantum information theory everywhere, from financial
                    <br />
                    mathematics to genetics.
                    <br />
                <p>Finally, about the last part of discussion about reality of information.
                    <br />
                    I understood that my rather restricted philosophic basis was not
                    <br />
                    sufficient to debate this problem on the same level as opponents of
                    <br />
                    non--reality of information. But I stay on my position: information is
                    <br />
                    not less real than mass or charge.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>I agree with S�ren Brier that the main problem is that in modern science
                    <br />
                    information is always reduced to probability:
                    <br />
                    &lt;&lt;Thus information as a basic quality in the world is something entirely
                    <br />
                    different from the present information theory that is based on
                    <br />
                    thermodynamics ensemble theory. That information concept is then more
                    <br />
                    basic than quantum theory.&gt;&gt;
                    <br />
                <p>There should be done something cardinally new...
                    <br />
                <p>I would like to thank all participants of out discussion.
