                    <br />
                <p>Representations play a critical role in both science and art.
                    <br />
                    Perceived as different in kind, artistic and scientific
                    <br />
                    representations have been studied as objects of distinct disciplinary
                    <br />
                    and intellectual traditions. However, recent work in both the
                    <br />
                    philosophy of science and studies of the visual arts suggests that
                    <br />
                    these apparently different representational traditions may be related
                    <br />
                    in challenging and provocative ways. &quot;Beyond Mimesis and Nominalism,&quot;
                    <br />
                    a conference co-sponsored by the Courtauld Institute of Art Research
                    <br />
                    Forum, the London School of Economics, and the Institute of
                    <br />
                    Philosophy of the University of London, seeks to open conversations
                    <br />
                    between and beyond these compartmentalized traditions of thinking
                    <br />
                    about representation.
                    <br />
                <p>According to dominant accounts, scientific representation is
                    <br />
                    explained by appeal to mimetic relationships such as similarity or
                    <br />
                    formal relations like isomorphism. As these views have been subjected
                    <br />
                    to increasing criticisms, recent approaches to scientific
                    <br />
                    representation have begun to draw upon analogies with artistic
                    <br />
                    representation. Significantly, parts of this emergent literature have
                    <br />
                    turned to a &quot;nominalist&quot; position, not unlike that advocated by
                    <br />
                    Nelson Goodman in his writings on representation in art.
                    <br />
                <p>But, a similar turn is already apparent within studies of visual art,
                    <br />
                    where scientific representations are increasingly integrated into the
                    <br />
                    analysis of art. Like their colleagues in the philosophy of science,
                    <br />
                    recent scholars in the visual arts have seen Goodman's work as an
                    <br />
                    important point of engagement. His pioneering work on the visual has
                    <br />
                    informed recent efforts to expand semantic taxonomies and to analyze
                    <br />
                    the increasing field of images that fall outside classification as
                    <br />
                    &quot;art.&quot; As this work has received important contribution from scholars
                    <br />
                    concerned with scientific imaging, the project of rethinking
                    <br />
                    representation is one of growing general importance to art-historical
                    <br />
                    studies, whose interpretative scope has expanded dramatically outward
                    <br />
                    in recent decades.
                    <br />
                <p>In order to press this emergent interdisciplinary conversation,
                    <br />
                    scholars from all disciplines are invited to submit papers to this
                    <br />
                    two-day international conference. We particularly seek submissions
                    <br />
                    that explore the &quot;how&quot; of representation-papers that can enrich our
                    <br />
                    understanding of the techniques employed in scientific representation
                    <br />
                    and/or address their semantic structures or historical convergences
                    <br />
                    with artistic practices - and vice versa. Also especially encouraged
                    <br />
                    are papers that critique, historicize or defend the conference's
                    <br />
                    central terms of mimesis and nominalism, or offer approaches to
                    <br />
                    representations that navigate a middle course between them.
                    <br />
