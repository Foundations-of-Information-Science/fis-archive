Dear Pedro and All:
<br />
<p>This response has been delayed because of travel.   Because of the long
<br />
delay, I have included most of Pedro's message within the response in
<br />
order to refresh the issues at at hand. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In responding to your last two messages (sorry for the delay) I will group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the topics in four separated blocks:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. INFORMATION AND BIOCHEMISTRY.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem I see with the physical and biochemical approaches to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenon of life (and of bioinfo), following your very arguments, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; largely similar to the discussions at the end of the 80's between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practitioners of Artificial Intelligence and of Artificial Life --this was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the underlying sense of some of the questions in my previous message.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
The bassis of this assertion of similarity between AI and biochemistry
<br />
escapes me.  The history of evolution has selected an infintesmal
<br />
fraction of all possible chemical structures and constructed a
<br />
communicative, collaborative, cooperative system from them. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although the &quot;brute force&quot; approach of the former AI was &quot;logically&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct, in the same sense than you have argued about biochemically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematic counting, mapping functions and one-to one correspondence, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turned out to be an approach scarcely relevant in order to advance the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge of neuronal (bio)processing. Rodney Brooks crafted very well the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments on why a new computational approach (ALife) were necessary --if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the further evolution of AL has really fulfilled its initial promises and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their new strategy has been fertile is another matter. I would encapsulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brooks' message as the &quot;rebellion of infinities&quot;: the AI impossible logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; management of the multiple emerging infinities in the encounter of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical agent with the complexities of a natural environment.
</em><br />
<p>I presume that this is also a metaphor.  All living systems are finite
<br />
in scale and in numbers of molecules.  The notion of &quot;rebellion&quot; of
<br />
molecules is a bit anthropromorphic, isn't it?   The taxonomy of all
<br />
molecules emerges from the organization of the atomic table. 
<br />
Description of the behavior of molecules does not require &quot;logical
<br />
agents&quot;, that is, something beyond the structures themselves.  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the same is happenning here. Infinities may be found one after the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other when you try to &quot;count&quot; e.g. how an enzyme folds, how it &quot;fishes&quot; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its substrate and transforms its electronic structures (implying in both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases the whole panoply of electromagnetic forces, vand der Waals forces,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic forces, electro weak interactions, etc.!!!),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to speak about how millions and billions of these molecules orchestrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their individual and collective activities... (this is one of the reasons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why molecular biology remains largely empirical and pragmatic).  Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further response that one can always give a logical &quot;kinetic counting&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tantamount to hide the rub under the carpet. 
</em><br />
<p>Counting is counting.  At the O05 degree of organization, we can count
<br />
as follows:  One cell grows and divides into two cells.  Two cells grow
<br />
and divide into four cells.  Fours cells grow and divide into eight
<br />
cells and so forth.  This is &quot;kinetic counting&quot; without specifiying the
<br />
time units.  As noted in earlier discussions, it depends on acquistion
<br />
of material from the surroundings.  Yes, one can add technical terms
<br />
describing chemical reactions at degree of organization O01 or O02 or
<br />
O03.  But such descriptions are in a different language and do not
<br />
influence how I count in the language of the cells and their material
<br />
relationship with the ecoment.   For a few simple bacteria cells, these
<br />
'countings' are bounded by attribues of the completely determined DNA
<br />
sequences.
<br />
<p>Precisely because of this very
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exhibition of complexities, there may emerge, from enzymes upwards, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amazing &quot;info-processing abilities&quot; of life (including neuro-processing and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence). And not from any other (yet unknown) set of inert chemicals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact is that &quot;taming infinities&quot; keeps being the regular business of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cells and of organisms (let us think on the math. graph of a trillion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interlinked neuronal processes).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<p>I do not understand why one should limit  &quot;exhibitions of complexities
<br />
from enzymes upward&quot;.  Energy flows are fundamental to sustaining life. 
<br />
In living systems, most energy flows result from oxidation - reduction
<br />
reactions and reactions closely coupled to oxidation - reduction
<br />
reactions (ATP and other nucleotides.)  Within a cell, oxidation -
<br />
reduction reactions involve objects at degrees of organization
<br />
O01,2,3,4.   I use the term &quot;co-laborative&quot; because it reflects the
<br />
labor (thermodynamic work functions) among the objects of different
<br />
degrees of organization necessary to accomplish the work of growth and
<br />
division.
<br />
<p>The reference to &quot;inert chemicals&quot; should be examined.  Biochemicals,
<br />
taken as individuals, exhibit physical chemical attributes just as all
<br />
other chemicals.  Biochemicals may also be &quot;inert&quot; in the sense that one
<br />
can define physical chemical conditions which no changes occur (usually!
<br />
some enyzmes are extrordinary perverse in this regard.)
<br />
<p>So, if biochemicals are no more or no less &quot;inert&quot; than other chemicals,
<br />
what distinguishes them?
<br />
I suggest that biochemicals are distinguishes by history.  An
<br />
evolutionary history of co-operative, collaborative and communicative
<br />
processes which results in the emergence of new degrees of organization
<br />
over the structural relationships among them.
<br />
<p>Finally, I iterate once again that all living systems are finite in
<br />
scale and finite in numbers of molecules.  The fact that large numbers
<br />
of molecules and large numbers of interactions must be counted can make
<br />
biochemistry ( and nueroanatomy!) difficult for both experimentalists
<br />
and theoreticians.  
<br />
I try to separate such scientific difficulties from confusing conceptual
<br />
difficulties or from philosophical differences.   
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. WATER
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That substance is something more than a &quot;source of protons (as its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taxonomical bioch. role)&quot;. In a relatively recent review (in Nature, 1996),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the question on how water structures interact with macromolecules, solute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ions, and colloidal particles, largely appears as an unanswered one. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amazing solvent, viscous, dielectric, electromagnetic, and crystalline
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of water are continuously called into action as a means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; putting an overall GLUE (let us remember Ray4s quest) in life activities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Water is a source of protons, but it is also the vehicle for prot. folding,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an active player in every enzymic function, a background of multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biophysical-electromagnectic processes, but above all it is the massive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interconnecting tool of bioinfo processes (coming back to the parallel with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers, water solves &quot;de gratis&quot; the awful WIRING PROBLEM that plagues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the design of electronic VLSI circuits). Both intracellularly and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intercellularly, water becomes an actual &quot;newspaper&quot; that contains in its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successive pages the RELEVANT info items to search for... (and this would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to the story of how to analyze compositional info--but this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becoming too long).
</em><br />
<p>Water is simply Hydrogen dioxide - H2O.  Taxonomically,  two hydrogens
<br />
and one ogygen. Two atoms of element one and one atom of element eight
<br />
in the atomic table.  Agreed, watert has many many unique physical and
<br />
chemical properties - as do all other chemicals.  It seems that the
<br />
description here is not about water at degree of organization O03, but
<br />
about potential relationships within a cell (O05) and with
<br />
macromolecules (O04).  These are other taxonomical classes and these
<br />
other classes should play an active role in the discussion of the
<br />
cooperative and collaborative aspects of water in living processes.
<br />
<p>(I fail to grasp the metaphor with a &quot;actual  newspaper.&quot;) 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. &quot;PRESENCES VERSUS ABSCENCES&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I made, a few years ago, a very simple automaton model of a regulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enzyme function. Its output was a binary series (just 0s and 1s) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; response to a series of binary inputs (substrate and effectors). Well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone argued me about the info behind every bit of the output. The &quot;0&quot;, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was told, represented a mere absence, so just one bit. But every &quot;1&quot; had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behind it all the above story about enzyme non-picturable function...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK about the 1s, but, was it true that the &quot;0&quot; was almost info-free?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My belated response was the idea of &quot;functional voids&quot; to be filled-in by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the productive machinery of the cell (eg. a call to protein synthesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the specific enzyme is out of work). So absences may have a genuine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; info content in the intra and intercellular communicating games--so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implying that the &quot;0&quot; might be even far richer than the &quot;1&quot;. This means, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another words, the necessary connection of the signaling (info) processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the underlying productive and degradative activities of the living.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I am affraid that, in these discussions, I have already argued about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the connection between signaling INFO - and the balanced PRODUCTION of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own structures (the idea of self-organized criticality, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one-sidedness of autopiesis) and do not want to insist further.
</em><br />
<p>I am uncertain what you are seeking to communicate here.
<br />
It is not surprizing that representations of biochemical processes by
<br />
simple strings of zeros and ones was not successful.  Efforts to
<br />
compress biochemical information are seldom successful.  What scientific
<br />
principle or rule suggested to you that biochemical information could be
<br />
compressed? 
<br />
I certainly agree that balanced production is fundamental to cellular
<br />
growth and division and that expereimental evidence supports the
<br />
cooperative and communicative relationships amongs degrees of
<br />
organization O01,2,3,4 for normal function. 
<br />
<p>I would be very cautious about conjectures that the absence of
<br />
information is in any way &quot;causal&quot; in the normal usage of the word
<br />
&quot;causal.&quot;  Perhaps &quot;absence&quot; could be casual if one first defined the
<br />
historical habits of a system and then removed one (or more) of the
<br />
habits from the description of the system. 
<br />
<p>I have sought to illustrate how an adequate taxonomy and the notion of
<br />
degree of organization influence our conceptional of the nature of
<br />
biological information processing.  It is my view that in the absence of
<br />
agreement about semiotics and semantics, our discussions simply flow
<br />
past one another rather than creating  meaningful communicative
<br />
exchanges.
<br />
<p>Cheers to All
<br />
Jerry
