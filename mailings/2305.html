Commenting upon Igor's reaction to my posting:
<br />
<p>Loet:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The issue is, in my opinion: under which conditions is the emerging  system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;able to develop an additional degree of freedom? If this is the  case, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;situation cannot be contained in the phase space ex  ante
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Igor:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We should be very specific about what do we take as a system here. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this is an individual organism, then we cannot talk about evolution and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new emerging degrees of freedom.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If, however, we discuss the population, or species, (and only this is, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my opinion, the correct level of discussion here), we surely do have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increase in the degrees of freedom. At biochemical level, as new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biochemical  reactions are added to metabolism, and the corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phase space (for  example, the phase space of metabolite concentrations)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increases its  dimensionality, hence extra degrees of freedom occur.  At
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cell structural level,  when new organelles evolve. At morphological level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the whole organism, when  new organs appear.  At environmental level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(new food chains).
</em><br />
<p>SS:  Based in the usage in evolutionary biology, I have formulated
<br />
definitions of:
<br />
Evolution = the irreversible accumulation of information
<br />
Development = predictable directional change (or, leaving out the observer,
<br />
constitutive change)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All materal changes include aspects of each kind of change.  At the
<br />
level of individual organisms, evolution is usually referred to as
<br />
'individuation'.   It could result in new degrees of freedoom in some
<br />
cases.  (1) Suppose we have a kind of fish that is capable of walking on
<br />
the bottom of a pond.  One individual happens to be more adventurous than
<br />
others in the population, and manages to come out of the water for a short
<br />
time.  Having learned to do this, this individual adds it to its repertoire
<br />
of behaviors.  Or, suppose a human being suddenly succombs to having
<br />
seizures.  After this, the number of degrees of freedom in the individual's
<br />
behavior has been increased by the addiion of an entirely new category..
<br />
<p>JC: &gt;&gt; An interesting question is how we can add dimensions to a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model of a system that is justified by our knowledge of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system. We do know that in standard physics, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibilities are given by the phase space of the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is a matter of definition, so Loet is simply violating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; technical terminology in the passage quoted above. If we add
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dimensions to a model without justification, it is very easy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to get the appearance of emergence without any reality to back it up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Loet: The problem is in the concept of &quot;reality&quot; which you use. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics does not include the social system as an order of expectations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or--to say it with Leibniz and Husserl--as another monad. If this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;justification is dismissed as a transgression of the physical reality, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the transdisciplinary communication stops and we would live in &quot;two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cultures.&quot; From my perspective, however, your discourse can be understood as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one which contains a specific set of rationalized expectations about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;reality&quot; or &quot;nature&quot; which can no longer understand the models of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality as parts of that reality. Insofar as a physicist manages to do this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one has to assume that the models are already contained in this reality from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an origin. This is precisely Leibniz's position: everything (the phase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space) was given by God at the moment of the Creation and revealed to us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because of His Grace. Our access is thus secured transcendentally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If order is not given ex ante, but constructed ex post, reality becomes an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;order of expectations. Physics then is the discourse which provides us with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;access on expectations concerning nature. One of the assumptions of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specific discourse of physics is that the phase space is already given (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;revealed).
</em><br />
<p>In the world of science, the actual takes precedence over the posssible,
<br />
which can be unlimited.  Early in the Big Bang science finds a purely
<br />
physical world.  This is soon followed by the origin of baryons and we now
<br />
have the constraints of a material world added to those of physics.  Much
<br />
later biological constraints became actualized, and so on.  In this view,
<br />
the occupiable phase space is ever increasingly narrowed by the additon of
<br />
new constraints, and the system could be described as senescing, having
<br />
exchanged unlimited possibility for one single conrete actuality.  The
<br />
degrees of freedom opened up by the emergence of new realms of nature did
<br />
not increase the size of the phase space AS GIVEN BY physics.  Instead,
<br />
volumes of this space have become linked by the cohesive tendencies of,
<br />
e.g., materiality, biology, and sociality, thereby decreasing the
<br />
configurational entropy of the purely physical phase space.  What Loet is
<br />
calling for is for us to assign these linkage groups (organisms, cities,
<br />
etc,) their own degrees of freedom, which did not exist prior to these
<br />
emergences.  However, it has not been excluded -- although few scientists
<br />
would invoke the possiility -- that among the early, purely physical
<br />
configurations, there appeared fleetingly microscopic configurations that
<br />
later we would take to be characteristic of, e.g., organisms, or cities, at
<br />
larger than microscopic scale.  An even less congenial- to- science
<br />
viewpoint here would be that of Structuralism, which would see such
<br />
pre-emergent momentary actualizations of future macroscopic forms as having
<br />
been called for by structural attractors which would, in the stickier
<br />
future world, become accessed permanently in chemistry, biology and
<br />
sociality.  Thus, the present world would have been immanent already in the
<br />
purely physical world, and, again, there would have been loss of
<br />
(potential) degrees of freedom.
<br />
<p>Obviosly it is necessary to state why such a view could have any validity
<br />
at all.  The reason is that there are too many unexplained SIMILARITIES in
<br />
Nature, from vortices, waves and trees to particularities like the products
<br />
of convergent evolution in biology, including even similarities at the
<br />
ecosystem level between different faunas.
<br />
<p>In any case, if one DOES take up the structuralist view, then even the
<br />
larger than microphysical degrees of freedom actually preceded their
<br />
actualization, and once again we do not have the emergence of any NEW
<br />
degrees of freedom  during the evolution of the world.  Indeed, if there
<br />
were (and why not?) deep structures that failed to successfully entrain the
<br />
physical world, their potential degrees of freedom were never actualized,
<br />
and so even large scale degrees of freedom will have diminished during
<br />
evolution.
