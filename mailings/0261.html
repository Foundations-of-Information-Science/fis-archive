I recently received a communication from Jim Logan of &quot;Infodynamics, Inc&quot;
<br />
asking about what appeared to him contradictory definitions of information
<br />
in my Information trilogy.   Below are the answers that I wrote him.  I
<br />
would welcome colleagues' comments.  It does fit into the discussion of
<br />
creating a taxonomy of information.
<br />
<p>Dear Jim,
<br />
Thanks for your communication of May 4th.  As you can see, I have retired
<br />
to the wilds of Western Massachusetts.  
<br />
<p>The apparent contradiction in defining information in various ways is a
<br />
reflection of our insistence that information must be one kind of thing. 
<br />
That is, one definition fits all.  First, we should be talking about
<br />
information systems and information processing systems, not merely about
<br />
information per se.  When we try to define information, we almost always
<br />
put it into some sort of system (e.g., DNA, Computer, Human speech, etc.). 
<br />
Each of the several examples I cite in Information and Meaning (Chapter 3)
<br />
involves entirely different vehicles for the transmission and storage of
<br />
information and for interpreting the signals.  Second, we should understand
<br />
that we are, at the end of the 20th C, about where the physicists were at
<br />
the end of 18th C in grappling with the concept of &quot;ENERGY&quot;.  We are only
<br />
now beginning to lay the foundation of a Science of Information and have
<br />
little understanding of the interconvertability of one form of information
<br />
for another (Information transduction), but at least I have developed some
<br />
quantification of the conversion of information to energy and vice versa.  
<br />
<p><p>On pgs. 17-19  (Information and Meaning) I compare how parallel are the
<br />
concepts of &quot;information&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;.  Remember that the concept of
<br />
&quot;energy&quot; is only a few centuries old and that it was not until the middle
<br />
of the 19th C that scientists began to understand that one form of energy
<br />
could be transduced to another and to be able to write the equations of
<br />
this conversion.  The reason I speculate on the existence of &quot;infons&quot; is to
<br />
focus attention on the &quot;physical&quot; reality of information.  
<br />
<p>As to your specific questions.  The first and most important fact is to
<br />
understand that Information is a basic property of the universe, like
<br />
energy, and like energy it has a reality of its own.
<br />
<p>Where do we go from here?  First, it leads to a much clearer understanding
<br />
of the transfer and transduction in physical information systems.  This
<br />
ridiculous concept of &quot;entropy&quot;, dear to the hearts of physical scientists
<br />
and engineers, can be done away with and described more simply as increases
<br />
in entropy reflect decreases in organization, hence information.  And, as
<br />
Information and the Internal Structure of the Universe describes, one can
<br />
calculate this loss of organization in terms of bits lost.
<br />
<p>Second, an organized system may become more organized as a result of adding
<br />
more information to it.  If one looks at the evolution of technology, for
<br />
example, many inventions became increasingly more efficient by later
<br />
improvements added on.  The same holds true for biological evolution, and,
<br />
for that matter, the evolution of any system (e.g. human language).  
<br />
<p>The important thing to remember is this.  There are information systems
<br />
which are different from, but build on more primitive information systems
<br />
in order to exist.  There exists a large and very elaborate hierarchy of
<br />
information systems.  As I said, I believe Information Science to be in a
<br />
state which is about 200 years behind the physicists.  It won't take us 200
<br />
years to catch up, but we badly need to develop a taxonomy of information
<br />
and information systems to truly understand the matter.  You might find
<br />
Chapter 3 of Information and Meaning helpful in these discussions.
<br />
<p>Anyway, thanks for your interest.  If you have further questions or
<br />
comments I would be happy to engage in further discussion.  I will send you
<br />
this by E-mail with hard copy to follow.  I may also put it out over the
<br />
FIS (Foundations of Information Science) network.
<br />
<p>With cordial best wishes.
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
<p><p><p>Tom Stonier
