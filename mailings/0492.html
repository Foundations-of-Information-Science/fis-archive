Betreff: First comment
<br />
<p><p>Dear Juan and Gente FIS,
<br />
i would like to comment your comments, from a sociological point of view:
<br />
<p>you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Concerning the ongoing discussion, let me turn specifically to the issue
</em><br />
of &quot;Does information play any role in purely physical (non-life)
<br />
interactions?&quot;, or, equivalently, &quot;Was there information before life?&quot;. I
<br />
try in my paper to justify negative answers to both questions.&lt;
<br />
Yes, one may try it and succeed in the attempt. One does not want to enter
<br />
the world of information, but is already inside. There are already
<br />
interactions ongoing, like in society. Particles &quot;behave&quot;, they have virtual
<br />
properties like colors, ressonances and zero energy levels (as a
<br />
sociologist, my knowledge is of course limited in quantum physics).
<br />
<p>Thats why the collegues speak of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;When interacting with an other object, a physical object will first
</em><br />
'evaluate' the information .... E.g., a charge recognises the Coulomb
<br />
field of an other charge and will interact with it......&quot;&lt;
<br />
<p>I think, in multidisciplinary work, this has to be at least allowed, althoug
<br />
distinction has to be made to esoteric approaches.
<br />
<p>But why cant you accept such language in physics, that uses brain function
<br />
metaphors.
<br />
You ask: &gt;what part of the object (or the particle) does the evaluating
<br />
or the recognizing? &lt;
<br />
Its not a part, its a function, a reflexive function of the matter itself.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How long does this process take?&gt;
</em><br />
It takes the time it needs to complete an entire cicle or phase of the
<br />
movement.
<br />
<p>&lt; The same applies to
<br />
the statement &quot;..a given mass, when it 'feels' a force, cannot make
<br />
distinction that the source of this effect was an other mass (gravitation)
<br />
or an inertia force&quot;? &lt;
<br />
<p>Ok, it does not feel, it is &quot;attracted&quot; by gravity. Attraction is a special
<br />
kind of feeling isnt it?
<br />
<p>You say: One needs a BRAIN to select, seek or decide,
<br />
I would say.
<br />
One needs just a BRAIN-FUNCTION to do so.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; we should realize that
</em><br />
this is information for us observers--it does not control any of  the
<br />
natural processes involved unless they pertain to living matter. In a
<br />
biological system, indeed, information is an active participant in its own
<br />
organization, behavior and multiplication, and information exists and
<br />
operates in total independence of any outside observer&quot;.&lt;
<br />
<p>Do you think that there are no observation-functions in physical states, as
<br />
an active participant in its own organization. You may believe it or not.
<br />
:-)
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, we cannot forbid ourselves thinking in these terms--we do it
</em><br />
all the time. &lt;
<br />
<p>I agree with you in this point. So while we do so, we should look on how we
<br />
do it. At this level, the information approach is more than necessary, dont
<br />
you think? If there were no information processes in physical acts, nobody
<br />
would ever have the ideia of any kind of information possible. Except God,
<br />
of course.
<br />
But appealing to God in a context
<br />
where it is not necessary (while perfectly possible given our cognitive
<br />
apparatus which happens to work with it) is like insisting in the use of a
<br />
clearly defined, but physically meaningless quantity.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please note that in the paper I start my discussion by turning to the
</em><br />
process if &quot;interaction&quot; (between two given systems) as the departing
<br />
point, as the most basic concept. &lt;
<br />
<p>Juan, thats what we all try to work out. Social action is interaction, you
<br />
may believe it or not.
<br />
<p>To &lt;avoid several semantic and subjective difficulties&lt; we have to go trough
<br />
this discussion.
<br />
<p>Gottfried, from Vienna
