<p>
Dear all,
<br />
As a member of the &quot;Vienna group&quot; around Wolfgang Hofkirchner at the Technical University,
<br />
&nbsp;I want to mention some things concerning the notion of information in the context of molecular biology.
<br />
<p>Epigenetic Networks: The Emergence of Cellular Information by Selforganization.
<br />
<p>The enlightment of the structure of the DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 lead to
<br />
&nbsp;a consolidation of the reductionistic view of the gene as the basic central agent in biological information
<br />
&nbsp;processing. The central Dogma of molecular biology formulated by F. Crick states that the information
<br />
&nbsp;necessary for building up and maintaining life flows just in one direction, basically from the genotype
<br />
&nbsp;(DNA) to the Proteins, which serve as structural and functional agents thus establishing a given Phenotype.
<br />
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA &gt; RNA &gt; Proteine &gt; Phenotype
<br />
<p>Fig.1 Linear processing of genetic information within the dogma of molecular biology.
<br />
<p>This few implements the following: 
<br />
1) Information flows only in one direction that is from the genotype to the phenotype.
<br />
2) Environmental imbalances (within a non-lethal range) do not essentially affect the genotype.
<br />
3) Mutations altering a given genotype are only stochastic sensations.
<br />
4) A given phenotype can be understood by the knowledge of all its constituents and by the knowledge
<br />
&nbsp;of the regulatory events how these constituents are build by translating the information encoded in the genes (DNA).
<br />
<p>This DNA-focused view of mainstream molecular biology joins the notion of information exclusively to the
<br />
&nbsp;genetic code. An enlargment of this DNA-focused view to a &quot;theory of life&quot; states that also complex behavior
<br />
&nbsp;and lapse (e.g. Cancer) can solely be explained by the action of genes and their surrogates. This view does not
<br />
&nbsp;consider the concerted action of multiple agents, when it is not possible to explain this actions in
<br />
&nbsp;a linear-causal model. 
<br />
This does not mean, that no linear interactions between elementsoccur in a cell, or that the scientists investigating
<br />
&nbsp;such circumstances are on the wrong way, but I want to mention that such linear views are not sufficient to 
<br />
explain biological information. So it is more the complex dynamic interaction of genes, proteins, metabolites
<br />
&nbsp;and signals from the environment that serve to define and maintaine the behavior of a cell.
<br />
Therefore it is necessary to develop an &quot;informationtheory of the cell&quot; wich explains how a cell under given
<br />
&nbsp;constrains develops special properties, which defines her function e.g. in a tissue, or enables the survival of
<br />
&nbsp;a single (cellular) individual by adaptation to a given reality.
<br />
One approach to such a multilevel view of living entities emphasizes an additional, informational network
<br />
&nbsp;within a cell, which integrates all the agents present to a highly organized informational state.
<br />
&nbsp;This informational network is of epigenetic nature which emphasizes the fact that it exists besides and above 
<br />
the allready well understood genetic network.
<br />

<br />
<p>Fig.2 Non-linear processing of cellular information mediated by epigenetic networks
<br />
. Flow of information occurs between all constituents. Also environmental parameters 
<br />
contribute to the state of epigenetic networks.
<br />
<p>The epigenetic networks, resemble the playground for selforganized phenomena, that give rise to
<br />
&nbsp;an organisational control above the genome, generating and maintaining a specific developmental
<br />
&nbsp;or terminal status of a cell.
<br />
(Epigenesis is a notion, allready used at the beginning of the 20th century by vitalistic biologists
<br />
&nbsp;(Driesch, Roux) to explain gestalt-building processes during morphogenesis. They used epigenesis
<br />
&nbsp;to designate a principle, similar to Aristotels entelechie, acting within every living entity. 
<br />
This principle, so the vitalists generates form and gestalt. 
<br />
A modern definition of epigenesis is given by Robin Holliday [1990, DNA methylation and 
<br />
epigenetic inheritance. in: Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. Lond. B326: 329-338]:
<br />
&quot;Classical genetics has revealed the mechanisms for the transmission of the genes from generation
<br />
&nbsp;to generation, but the strategy of the genes in unfolding the developmental programme remains
<br />
&nbsp;obscure. Epigenetics comprises the study of the mechanisms that impart temporal and spacial
<br />
&nbsp;control on the activity of all those genes required for the development of a complex organism
<br />
&nbsp;from the zygote to the adult. As such it establishes the basis for a level of organisational control
<br />
&nbsp;above the genome; a level that is now well established in fact, but continues to evade decisive theoretical insight&quot;.
<br />
<p>So there are two essential different informational systems in a cell:
<br />
(a) The processing of genetic information (as encoded by DNA) leads to the structural and functiona
<br />
l elements of a cell (linear processing by transcription, splicing, translation ...)
<br />
(b) The processing of epigenetic information (emerging as a cause of different parameters in a given
<br />
&nbsp;compartment, such as certain proteins in defined quantities, metabolites and signals obtained
<br />
&nbsp;from the environment) leads to the coordination of all agents and enables an integrated behavior of the cell.
<br />
Epigenetic networks generate self-organized patterns which constitute the cellular information
<br />
&nbsp;(remind Benard-Cells, Belousov-Zhabotinsky-Reaktion or the life-cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum).
<br />
&quot;Gene silencing&quot;, &quot;Genomic imprinting&quot;, &quot;Transposition&quot; and &quot;Paramutation&quot; are today well known 
<br />
epigenetic mechanisms, which alter the cellular information without altering the genetic information.
<br />
&nbsp;But about the cause of epigenetic effects exists no consense in the scientific world, because there is
<br />
&nbsp;still a lack of a theoretical base to explain epigenetic phenomena.
<br />
I try to understand them on the base of Selforganisation Theory in that way that non-linear
<br />
&nbsp;events (e.g. small cause, big effect) provoke the emergence of coherent behavior of specific
<br />
&nbsp;agents present, effecting the generation of a new informational state of the cell. In mathematical
<br />
&nbsp;terms this means that e.g.the cells of a multicellular organism tend towards different attractors,
<br />
&nbsp;which represents a defined physiological state cells and differentiate them into cells with diverse
<br />
&nbsp;behavior, constituting different tissues, although all the cells contain the identical genetic information. 
<br />
