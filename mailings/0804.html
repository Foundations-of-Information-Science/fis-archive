<p><p>Details on the Session:
<br />
Title: Foundations of Self-Organisation
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Description: Since the sixties and the seventies, the disciplines of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science have been increasingly focussing on self-organisation and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complexity studies. Although interdisciplinarity is one of the main 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characteristics of self-organisation theory, the approaches are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather scattered and a unified theory of self-organisation remains 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be established. The aim of this session is to explore foundations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of such a yet-to-be-developed unification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Topics to be covered in this session include:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*the exploration of the philosophical relationship of self-organisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory and classical, modern and postmodern philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*the relationship of information and self-organisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*differences and similarities between physical, biological and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social self-organisation

<p><p><p><p><p>It is certainly very short time to prepare something properly, 
<br />
however I might be willing to participate expressing something about 
<br />
the following tentative assumption (I still must develop it):
<br />
<p><p>Human gregariousness seems to motivate every mind to invite and even 
<br />
encourage other minds to organize together anything that suddenly 
<br />
seems to become the common concern of all  those who recognize the 
<br />
need of working together for the betterment of their common concern.
<br />
<p>So far not so good because  from time to time every human recognizes 
<br />
that other humans are deeply concerned in doing or attaining 
<br />
something that contradicts what he or she and his and her immediate 
<br />
colleagues have determined as their main interest even as if it were 
<br />
their reason for being alive.
<br />
<p>The whole historical trajectory of humankind even before the so 
<br />
called civilizing processes started to be conceived and organized has 
<br />
been and continue being until today a sanguinary confrontation among 
<br />
gregarious groups of people trying to disorganize what other 
<br />
gregarious groups are trying to achieve
<br />
<p>Most human actions can be considered self-organized by one or another 
<br />
group of people
<br />
<p>Today in the year 2002 humankind is facing the worst crisis ever 
<br />
faced because many groups are trying to organize themselves their 
<br />
capabilities in order to use unilaterally the capabilities of other 
<br />
groups and also in order to destroy the achievements of other 
<br />
self-organized groups and even to annihilate or massacre them.
<br />
<p>However it can be assumed that there is still some hope for humans to 
<br />
realize that they may cooperate through increasingly well 
<br />
comprehended Weltanschauung Systems to identify how to make 
<br />
complementary their very diverse appraisals, after recognizing that 
<br />
human intelligence may play a sensible role on Earth learning 
<br />
continuously to develop the perspectivism as a sensible 
<br />
epistemological tool.
<br />
<p>The development of self-organizing capabilities in human minds, after 
<br />
their successful emergence, must bear in mind that human spontaneity, 
<br />
based on simple common sense, is causing the human species to become 
<br />
an endangered one
<br />
<p><p>It is only a first draft for October 18th. 2002
<br />
<p>Title:
<br />
Weltanschauungen and perspectivism derived from Bertalanffy's 
<br />
thinking may help humans to self-organize their role on Earth
