                    Just finished reading the messages of this thread, particularly
                    <br />
                    the messages from sbr.lpf&#64;cbs.dk on 4 September 2005,
                    <br />
                    from collierj&#64;ukzn.ac.za on 2 September 2005, and
                    <br />
                    from dbar_x&#64;cybermesa.com on 2 September 2005. Several
                    <br />
                    known definitions were discussed in these messages.
                    <br />
                <p>To narrow our definition, we may accept that
                    <br />
                <p>1. &quot;Information (I) is a physical representation&quot; (Rolf Landauer, cited
                    <br />
                    by Michael Devereux.
                    <br />
                <p>2. Information has a quantitative measure. It has a unit in bit.
                    <br />
                    Of course it is measurable.
                    <br />
                <p>3. Higher amount of information is related to higher value of
                    <br />
                    --difference (this is my understanding of &quot;a difference that makes difference&quot;.
                    <br />
                    --reduction of uncertainty (OK with me)
                    <br />
                    --complexity (Gregory J. Chaitin's examples. Need more comments)
                    <br />
                    --data after processing or refining (Marcin J. Schroeder citations)
                    <br />
                <p>These all conform with my definition that &quot;information is the
                    <br />
                    compressed data&quot;. Data processing or refining should be taken
                    <br />
                    as data compression.
                    <br />
                <p>The best possible data compression has the similar meaning
                    <br />
                    as Gregory J. Chaitin's &quot;minimal program&quot;
                    <br />
                    (<a
                        href="../../www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/sciamer.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/sciamer.html</a>).
                    <br />
                <p>What is data L (or raw data) measured in bits? It is a
                    <br />
                    property of a structure. What is a structure? A formatted
                    <br />
                    harddisk in use has certain structure and has a raw data of L bits.
                    <br />
                    Many examples of mechanics or thermodynamics can be given.
                    <br />
                <p>The raw data L is conserved for many systems and &quot;three laws&quot;
                    <br />
                    similar to the laws expressed as energy and entropy in
                    <br />
                    thermodynamics can be given.
                    <br />
                <p>Best regards,
                    <br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is indeed a pity you could not come to Paris. I hope you can come to
                        Salzburg next year, maybe we can come to Japan some year?

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am very happy about your acknowledgement of the necessity of a deep
                        philosophical approach, and I appreciate you use of Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism plus
                        phenomenology.

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also agree in the understanding of the many types of definition of
                        entropy based information as tools for different purposes. We should write them down and
                        classify them and their subject area.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; But running though you FIS paper (I could not get to the one in Entropy)
                        you only slightly touch upon a theory of consciousness, which I agree with you is necessary, but
                        hardly on a theory of meaning, which I think is absolutely essential. This is why I have studied
                        Peirce's semiotics for many years now.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Discussing information we need both an ontology and an epistemology, and
                        we needs concepts of truth and meaning, as well as of quantity and quality, and most of all how
                        we are going to relate them to each other. My strategy has been to give the quantitative aspect
                        to information science (with a base in thermodynamics) and the qualitative to semiotics (with a
                        base in Peirce's philosophy of qualia and feeling).

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; clarification:&quot;What is THE definition of information?&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks like it automatically assumes that there is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; one &quot;good&quot;, &quot;proper&quot;, or &quot;best&quot; definition

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of information&quot;. However, there is no reason to expect that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is such a unique definition. Since I myself proposed a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition which differs essentially from other definitions,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently I have had some reason to believe that my
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition is better than those published before.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that there are some criteria which can be used to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; compare definitions of information, but I do not believe
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is possible unique answer to the question &quot;What
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is information?&quot; without any reference to pragmatics, for

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance to the context in which this concept is going to be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; used. After all, we define concepts to explain what we mean
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; by them. When somebody gives me logically correct definition
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of some concept, I cannot say &quot;It is wrong&quot;, but only
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;I am not interested in this concept&quot;, or that &quot;I do
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; not believe this definition can be applied to what we agreed
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is denotation of the concept.&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are some cases when the definition can be criticized

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; for incompatibility with commonly agreed hierarchy of

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Simple example: It would be an error to say that temperature

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, we measure temperature by measuring the position of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; top of the pillaret, but without a theory of the thermal

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; expansion of liquids, this measurement is irrelevant for the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; question what is temperature. Only after we have definition
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the concept of temperature, we can say that the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermometer measures temperature. Thus, I have some

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; as &quot;functional&quot; (probably similar to what I call

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatically (as for instance the concept of &quot;set&quot;). The
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter case is when for given concept there is no more

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; general concept.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not believe that the concept of information is so
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; general, so at the moment I will not discuss the possibility

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. I would like to address also a delicate issue of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical correctness. Many of you can react that it is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; wasting of time for trivialities, but I believe it is not.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my extensive collection of various published attempts to

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; incorrect.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes they have been formulated in an incorrect manner
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (possibly) intentionally to express desperation on the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulty of the attempt to define such a general concept.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; A good example is Searl's definition which could be used in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; an introductory logic textbook as an instance of an error

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;circular definition&quot; (hereafter no reference means that
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; references can be found in my paper mentioned

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; This brings us to the first rule of logically correct

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition:

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the definiens (that which defines) no reference can be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; made to the definiendum (that which is defined).

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. The rule should be expanded to the cases where the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference is indirect, it means when the concept in the

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; definiens is defined somwhere else using definiendum. This

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived from the correspondence of entropy and uncertainty
                    </em><br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two generic meanings of the word &quot;uncertainty&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; known to me. One is the &quot;lack of information&quot;, the other is

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; a psychological state of distress caused by lack of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information. In either case the definition clearly violates

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, the definition can be saved by considering uncertainty

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; then its denotation becomes very narrow.

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; famous &quot;definition&quot; is most frequently used by those who

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; for engineers. But it is quite clear that the psychological

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Coming back to the &quot;definition&quot; using the concept of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertainty in the definiens. Someone can object that this
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; word has different, non-generic meaning. Then it has to be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; provided, and in its defition no reference to information

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of defining information, but I have confes my scepticism

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the success.

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Roughly speaking, information is that commodity capable of
                    </em><br />

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason why this definition is not acceptable to me is this

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; bizarre choice of the genus for information. I do not say

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be defined in without any reference to information. Thus

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dretske's definition is doomed to become circular, or

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it describes an entity which can be found in many
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; domains of our inquiry. Thus all definitions which restrict
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the domain of denotation to only few instances of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, no matter how logically correct, are just not
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; intertesting.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I need a tool of big power, a definition which refers to all
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena identified as involving information in

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication, thermodynamics, computer science, genetics,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive science, etc.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the definition directly refers to very narrow domain, as
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; for instance when information is restricted to psychology,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is just not very interesting. For me it is not much
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than using what Webster Dictionary can tell us about
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; This applies to some cases where the concept considered is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of independent interest. For instance Fisher's information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; is for me interesting as a potential special instance of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; more general concept. Actually, Fisher never defined clearly
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the concept of information. He only considered a measure of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information in a sample, quite likely understood by him as a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; source for knowledge, about the value of the parameter in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the population provided the first moment exists. Thus, it is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult to place Fisher's information among the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions of the concept of information, even if the work
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Fisher is interesting for itself.

                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10. In this discussion Bateson's definition of information
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; as &quot;a difference that makes difference&quot; has been recalled.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; It achieved a status of a celebrity, right next
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;uncertainty definition&quot;. It is charmful, seducing. I can
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine that it can have special appeal to those who like
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; esoteric style of conversation. Little jewel, like zen koan
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; or haiku. I can imagine exalted pseudo-intellectuals
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying &quot;I tells me so much about information...&quot;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; But actually it tells us nothing. Its popularity is based on
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; open-endedness. You can put into it whatever you want, and
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; it looks like it works. Actually it doesn't.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a definite difference between beer and water. It
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes big difference to me whether waiter brings me one or
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other to the table. But it is not information.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; More seriously. Bateson &quot;definition&quot;'s appeal comes from:
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; - logically incorrect use of a relative noun without its
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; referents. Difference between what? Whatever? I remember how
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; much I enjoyed elementary school jokes such as &quot;The bird has
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; one leg from the other&quot;. I could laugh many times from the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; same sentence tasting its absurdity. But now, I am an adult,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; and after grading thousands of homework assignments of my
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; students with similar curiosial sentences written without
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; any intention to entrtain me, it is not funny anymore.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Bateson is using an idiom in English &quot;to make a
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference&quot;. Try to translate his definition into another
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; language and you will see how much it loses in its appeal.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my mother tongue (Polish) it becomes dull and shallow.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; To give full justice to Bateson's &quot;definition&quot; it has one
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; good aspect. It refers to the concept of &quot;difference&quot; which
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; points to the concept of variety. And this way leads to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical foundations which are in my opinion
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate for the concept of information.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; The issue of such philosophical foundations is of great
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance for interesting definition of information.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt;
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11. Why so many attempts to define information seem
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; questionable?
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me explain my opinion. In many attempts the concept of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; information was being placed through the definition in the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; framework of other concepts which were supposed to be
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple, easy, intuitive. Especially last qualification is
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; dangerous. It is illusion that the definition referring to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitively obvious terms is the best, easiest to
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand. Only someone very naive can believe that the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of such great generality as information can be put
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a framework of simple, intuitive, daily-life concepts.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; To have interesting general concept of information we should
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; look for a framework of extensive, rich philosophical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; tradition. There were some attempts to do it. All direction
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of defining the concept of information in terms of
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;form&quot; was based on this assumption, although in some
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases the motivation was simply ethymology of the
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; word &quot;information&quot;. It has source in an old idea in
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotelean tradition of the concept of substance. Form
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; informs matter, matter materializes form to become
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; substance.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not want to go too far in talking about this direction
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; (see for instance P. Young The Nature of Information, 1987),
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; but for the reasons which I explained in my FIS 2005 paper,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe another approach is better.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; For this discussion, I would like to express my deep
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; conviction that the general concept of information requires
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; for its foundations an appropriate rich philosophical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; tradition with its developed conceptual framework.
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; I myself have selected probably the oldest philosophical
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; tradition of Europe and Asia of the study of one-many
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation. Someone not satisfied with my definition can look
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; for different foundations and their different use. But I
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that as long as information is defined in terms
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;uncertainty&quot; or similar concepts which are just simple,
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; easy, obvious, the outcomes are not likely to be

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting.
