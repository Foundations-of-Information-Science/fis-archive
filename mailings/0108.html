Dear Jerry,
<br />
<p>thank you for your comments. Just some ideas on them:
<br />
1) As I was considering the difference between:
<br />
&quot;Information is a difference which makes a difference&quot; (Bateson)
<br />
and 
<br />
&quot;Information is a difference which finds a difference&quot; (Luhmann)
<br />
I was having in mind a very good article by Qvotrup published in 
<br />
Soerens Journal Cybernetics, where he (Qvortrup) establishes a 
<br />
difference between thinking about information whithin the natural 
<br />
sciences (first definition) and withing psychic and social systems 
<br />
(second definition).
<br />
This double-side (maybe double-bind) structure of the concept of 
<br />
information is clearly stated by Weizsaecker (in different epochs of 
<br />
his writings). The key point is, I think, to question the idea that 
<br />
information is something &quot;out there&quot;, &quot;objective&quot; (a &quot;thing&quot; that can 
<br />
be transported from A to B). The classic situation is the one given 
<br />
by a knower, for whom something is (becomes) information with 
<br />
relation to (!) his/her knowledge structure. Weizsaecker says, that 
<br />
we can 'in a certain sense' (!) consider living (and non-living) 
<br />
structuress as a basis for something to become information (to make a 
<br />
difference) (or not). But he states, at the same time, that this 
<br />
process of attributing something to a structure as its information is 
<br />
being on a knowledge basis (we are grasping the difference as such).
<br />
This last insight is, philosophically speaking, a transcendental 
<br />
(Kantian) argumentation, i.e. it sound profoundly idealistic from the 
<br />
viewpoint of natural science! Weizsaecker argues also as a Platonist 
<br />
by considering the possibility of 'forms in themselves' (ideas), but 
<br />
he states that our point of view is (in contrast to Plato's) a 
<br />
dynamic (evolutionary) one and a saecular one (non-divine).
<br />
2) Some 20 years ago I made an etymological and historical 
<br />
investigation on the word/concept of information (published by Saur 
<br />
Verlag Munich, but not available any more). I was guided to this 
<br />
investigation by Weizsaecker's hint, that the concept of information 
<br />
is a new (modern) way of thinking about the Platonic and Aristotelian 
<br />
concepts of idea, eidos, morphe, which are at the basis of Western 
<br />
Philosophy (and science). I found out, that the Latin word 
<br />
'informatio' as used for instance by Cicero and later on by thinkers 
<br />
like Augustine and through the Middle Ages (Thomas Aquinas etc.) was
<br />
basically connected to ontological and epistemological texts of 
<br />
Platon and Aristotle concerning Eidos/Idea/Morphe/Typos. It was used 
<br />
in the sense of 'giving a form' (a difference that makes a 
<br />
difference!) as well as 'giving a form to the soul' (finding a 
<br />
difference), and both processes were intimately related. The word 
<br />
lost in Modernity (since ca. the 16th century, entering into French, 
<br />
English, Spanish) its ontological meaning and retained (until now!) 
<br />
the epistemological meaning of: giving knowledge to someone. Why did 
<br />
it lost its ontological meaning (which is having now a renaissance 
<br />
for instance in this forum)? My hypothesis is, that Modernity 
<br />
questioned Scholastic philosophy and ontology and with this 
<br />
questioning also the concept of 'giving form'. There are interesting
<br />
text from Descartes, where you can see use of the term which is 
<br />
sometimes scholastic some times almost telematic! 
<br />
Shannon and Weaver, by puting aside the semantic and pragmatic 
<br />
aspects of the concept, provoked a naturalization of information and 
<br />
gave rise to our present thinking.
<br />
Well this is in a very (!) short way, what I can tell you about it. 
<br />
One last remark. I asked myself many years what was the corresponding 
<br />
concept (!) (not the word) for our anthropological sense of 
<br />
information in ancient Greek. It was supposed to be 'logos'... But I 
<br />
found out, that 'angelia' (message) is a much better 'trans-lation'. 
<br />
This is a fascinating area of research, given the dominance of 
<br />
'messages' in our present (scientific) communication. But this is 
<br />
also another story... (you can find some hints on it, in English, in 
<br />
a book: Information as a multidisciplinary concept, edited by Klaus 
<br />
Kornwachs, published by Springer 1997).
<br />
Regards to all
<br />
Rafael
