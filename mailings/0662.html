Dear John,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the questions --and for the insightful preamble. Maybe that we 
<br />
maintain a nice and open-minded atmosphere is as much important as the 
<br />
contents we exchange... Well, here there are my replies to your new Qs:
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;R. Lahoz-Beltra and Vieri Di Paola say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2.      The 'hardware + software' dualism leads to a misleading conception 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of cell. In cells 'biomolecule + function' are inseparable elements in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contrast with computers. For instance, it is possible to have a computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without operating system and software. Of course, it is not useful but in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cells it is impossible to have biomolecules without biological function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q4. How important is this difference, and does it have any bearing on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;issue of whether a formal system can have a semantics that is not implied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;externally?
</em><br />
<p>Very important, in my opinion. Variants on this question-problem may be at 
<br />
the very heart of different schools of thought: functionalism, behaviorism, 
<br />
cognitivism, artificial intelligence --in what extent one can extract the 
<br />
'essential' programs and run them in quite different hardwares and 
<br />
'wetwares'? In the cellular context the authors (Rafael and Vieri) address 
<br />
the theme, I believe that Michael Conrad produced the most elaborate views 
<br />
--biological processing vs. electronic computing-- implying the interplay 
<br />
of picturability, programmability, evolvability, and processing 
<br />
architecture. His tradeoff principle represents a very elegant summary.
<br />
<p>Besides, the enormous difference in complexity depth of the elementary 
<br />
components (just comparing enzymes and transistors) has to be emphasized. 
<br />
There is very efficient models which capture the temporal behavior of the 
<br />
electronic agents (down to the quantum level) while the converse happens 
<br />
with proteinaceous stuff. Its function is non-picturable at the quantum 
<br />
level, as it implies an immense panoply of Coulombian, electro-weak 
<br />
(dipole, van der Waals, London...), and entropy related forces (eg, 
<br />
interaction with water). Actually enzymes themselves force us, as limited 
<br />
scientific observers, to the heterogenous 'superposition' of a variety of 
<br />
disciplinary approaches: biochemistry, bioenergetics, classical enzymology, 
<br />
molecular biology, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, quantum models. And 
<br />
let us add degradation phenomena (and protein folding).
<br />
<p>So, honestly we should admit that characterizing the bioinfo function 
<br />
posses us a very tough problem. In comparison with its docile and 
<br />
formalizable electronic counterpart, the 'structural' info dynamics of the 
<br />
living cell is not properly solved yet. Its relevant 'formal' (?? --I do 
<br />
not find a better adjective) properties have not been elaborated yet.  And, 
<br />
yes, I believe this relates to the biological fabrication of meaning (in a 
<br />
strong sense, implying sentience &amp; 'qualia').
<br />
<p><p><p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jerry LR Chandler says:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A central hypothesis is that correspondence relations between algebraic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species and organic species generate a robust basis for message 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specificity and sensitivity.  I presuppose that category theory is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suitable mathematical framework for a general theory of communication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q5. Must this correspondence be such that organic species resemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational &quot;agents&quot; as used in Alife programs, in which communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is fully formalized in terms of explicit rules (&quot;methods&quot;)?
</em><br />
<p>I am friendly with Jerry's goals: interrelating structure with 
<br />
communication. Cellularly, the items produced as external 'messengers' (or 
<br />
internally as 'second messengers') are not independent of the ongoing 
<br />
structural chemical processes. But adumbrating that interrelationship 
<br />
becomes, again, a pretty difficult task--it obviously relates to the 
<br />
previous comments on Q4, although let me remark that I am not implying any 
<br />
intrinsic mysticality or impossibility of the task. It looks to me that it 
<br />
implies a very serious interdisciplinary challenge and a necessary change 
<br />
in mind from reductionist towards integrationist stances in larger segments 
<br />
of the scientific community (eg, today maybe we are paying the easy 
<br />
dismissal of classical physiology integrative constructs). At the time 
<br />
being we must consider Alife agents, category theory, multidimensional 
<br />
partitions... we have to try with every available tool in order to 
<br />
conceptually capture the 'vertical order' that supports cellular 
<br />
organization and multicellular and organismic life, our own nervous system 
<br />
included.
<br />
<p>Having said that, let me remind John H's very recent posting on the 
<br />
vertical info view 'cells (organisms) / firms / states' --well I have 
<br />
smuggled-in organisms.     Shouldn't we attempt a combined 
<br />
inter-theoretical-exploration too? I mean, we could learn a little bit 
<br />
about the way the cellular structure organizes its turnover and renovation 
<br />
of elements and relates with its environment, also by looking on how our 
<br />
own nervous system organizes its exploration (and abduction) upon the 
<br />
environmental info items or affordances in order to build a decent life 
<br />
(Terry's posting!), or how the accounting system of a company extracts a 
<br />
few info items upon a terrible complex background of micro-operations, or 
<br />
the way a country 'representatives' decide that it is this or that piece of 
<br />
info the relevant item to be included into the agenda of a planetary 
<br />
conference or to be thrown upon a generous dose of 'ordnance'.
<br />
<p>In sum, a family of related theoretical problems at multiple 'vertical' 
<br />
levels are receiving presently a very clumsy contemplation by our social 
<br />
system of knowledge. We really miss the cogent info sci perspective, not as 
<br />
the final TOE (theor. of everything) but just as another little voice 
<br />
singing its part within the global choir of the sciences (a childish voice, 
<br />
of course).
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christophe Menant says:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A meaning is an information representing the connection between an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;incident information and the constraint of the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;More completely:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;A meaning is a meaningful information that is created by a system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;submitted to a constraint when it receives an external information that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has a connection with the constraint. The meaning is formed of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;connection existing between the incident information and the constraint of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the system. The function of the meaningful information is to participate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the determination of an action that will be implemented in order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;satisfy the constraint of the system&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q6. Is this characterization of meaning formalizable, and in particular is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the notion of the constraint of the system formalizable?
</em><br />
<p>As I had replied to Cristophe in a previous message I am very intrigued 
<br />
with 'the constraint' notion as an interlevel ascending tool (by the way, 
<br />
perhaps using 'constraints' would be better). They appear to me as 
<br />
computational surrogates to climb, or to descend, the commands from an 
<br />
adjacent level of complexity description.  Usually, our sciences establish 
<br />
new 'principles' and ad hoc disciplines in order to contemplate the 
<br />
emerging existentialities at higher or lower levels. If so, the 
<br />
'principles' or 'constraints' or 'reglaments' or 'constitutions' matter 
<br />
quite a lot for our understanding of the emerging info entities...
<br />
<p>I hope the responses were not too long.
<br />
<p>Have a good weekend.
<br />
<p>Pedro
