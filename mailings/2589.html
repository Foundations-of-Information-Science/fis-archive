Dear Michael:
<br />
<p>Your post is surprising close to my own view, but we are using the  
<br />
words differently.
<br />
<p>(I should note that I was in a playful mood when I used the term  
<br />
&quot;trinitarian physics&quot;.  The triad of &quot;space time energy&quot;  is so often  
<br />
abused in the philosophy of science literature that a use of a  
<br />
metaphor with religious doctrine seemed appropriate.)
<br />
<p>With regard to the term &quot;physical objects&quot;, what does it mean to you?
<br />
If all things are &quot;physical objects&quot;, then certainly this &quot;Schoolman&quot;  
<br />
philosophy imputes that all concrete information is physical. very  
<br />
simple deduction; no need for discussion.  I presuppose that this is  
<br />
your usage.  But, as you write in your post, this view of &quot;physical  
<br />
objects&quot; is no longer accepted.  String theory, as I understand it,   
<br />
is merely mathematics, untestable by experiment.  I would be  
<br />
delighted if someone could point me to experiments designed to test  
<br />
string theory.
<br />
<p>If all things are chemical objects, then all concrete information is  
<br />
chemical.  But, as you write in the example in your post, a chemical  
<br />
object, is the SOURCE of study of physical objects.  And, as you are  
<br />
well aware, the logic of chemical structures is based on the atomic  
<br />
numbers.  These atomic numbers are the natural origins of the  
<br />
mathematical number systems from which physical thought is derived.   
<br />
This is what I mean by foundational.
<br />
<p>I provide explicit comments within your post.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Colleagues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand Landauer’s insight not as an analysis of the logical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of information, nor of its ubiquitous utility throughout  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human endeavors, but rather as a more precise description of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanisms for storage and transmission of information.
</em><br />
What are you seeking to express?
<br />
If the concept of information is an independent concept, a  
<br />
foundational concept, a concept from which other concepts are  
<br />
derived, then why drag in notions of storage and transmission?
<br />
I suggest your sentence suggests a tacit recognition that of the  
<br />
system science perspective of communication of encoded information,  
<br />
otherwise, the precise description of information lacks meaning, does  
<br />
it not?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to Landauer, and I think he was right about this,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information is exclusively stored in the configuration of physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects,.and transmitted only by material entities. So, for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, the energy configuration of a simple bi-level atom would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain a single bit of information, represented by zero, say, in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its ground configuration, and by one in its excited level. Of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course the physical configuration of the atom’s nucleus, made up of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protons and neutrons, must also contain additional information,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignored in this instance. And we know that protons and neutrons are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves composed of quarks, whose physical configuration must  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also contain more information. And, as far as we know, those quarks  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be constituted by some structure of strings, with even more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, and so on.
</em><br />
<p>I concur with the possibility of mathematical projections from  
<br />
&quot;strings&quot;.  But, by using this argument you are in effect agreeing  
<br />
with my position.  That modern physics (not 19 th Century physics) is  
<br />
effectively applied mathematics.
<br />
<p>In order to compose your narrative, it is necessary to re-define the  
<br />
concept of a bit  from the context of a message and a communication  
<br />
between a sender and a receiver.  In place of a bit as a unit of  
<br />
communication, the narrative moves into abstractions of abstractions,  
<br />
in other words, mathematics.  In doing so, the context of the term  
<br />
&quot;bit&quot; as a unit of encoded communication between sender and receiver  
<br />
disappears; the meaning is lost and the ability to decipher the  
<br />
message is lost.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also understand Landauer to tell us that information is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transmitted from one thing to another only by physical objects, all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which are composed of energetic quanta. As, for instance,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sending information on a telegraph line by a series of electrical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impulses, each of which contains many electrons. I know of no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason to suppose that the information any person holds and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploits, even about mathematics, is not stored and transmitted  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically, as Landauer has said.
</em><br />
<p>I respond with a simple question:
<br />
Is the information content of DNA a physical form of information?
<br />
If so, can you construct a narrative that reveals how this  
<br />
information is encoded from physical principles?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jerry wrote that “mathematics is often deemed as abstraction, (so)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical information is often deemed as abstract.” But, it is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the brain cells and synaptic connections, their chemical and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrical configuration and signal processing, which alone permits  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us to employ mathematics.
</em><br />
<p>Hmmmm, a curious view.
<br />
Does this mean that the sperm and egg of our parents contain  
<br />
mathematics?
<br />
Or, is mathematics one of several abstract symbol systems emerging  
<br />
from human cultural activities and human communication?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly, traumatic injury to the brain (or death, even) can destroy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a person’s mathematical facility. I suppose neuroscientists today  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may even be able to locate those specific areas of the brain that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process mathematical thoughts.
</em><br />
<p>The switch between local and global arguments is fascinating.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that those who might claim that physics is merely  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applied mathematics, that it lacks any self standing domain, are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly mistaken.
</em><br />
<p>Why?  Is it your philosophy of physics that it is a self standing  
<br />
domain that merely invokes mathematics when needed to solve problems?
<br />
In one physical philosophy, all the universal is connected by fields  
<br />
such that the notion of &quot;self standing domain&quot; is itself without ground.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those of us who are physical scientists recognize that our models  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the physical world must always be validated by tangible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations in controlled experiments.
</em><br />
<p>Always?  I have followed the theories of astronomy  / cosmology for  
<br />
several decades.
<br />
Would you make an exception for these folks, who can not re-set the  
<br />
clock and circumstances at will?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That, I believe, distinguishes the physical sciences from pure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<p>The issue is not merely distinction.  I concur with you that the  
<br />
distinction is easy to make.  The issue is one of foundations, of  
<br />
sources, of beginnings, or origins, or &quot;ur...&quot;     Perhaps we are  
<br />
talking past one another?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have yet to meet the chemist, biologist, geologist,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paleontologist, astronomer, or physicist who seeks to treat matter  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself as a disembodied abstract entity.
</em><br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I recommend to you A. N. Whitehead, &quot;Process and Reality&quot;.  I just  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; returned from the Whitehead conference in Salzburg.  (The program  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is on the web.)  My impression was that I was one of the few  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presenters in the chemistry and biology sections that DID NOT seek  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to treat matter  &quot;as a disembodied abstract entity.&quot;  but rather as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrete particles with specific identities that can be reified.
</em><br />
<p>MD:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Landauer certainly didn’t do that, and the rest of us, also, I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe, clearly see the difference between a mathematical model of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical world, and the world itself. Because we carefully  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe that world in our experiments.
</em><br />
<p>Again, the issue is about foundations. For more than 15 years, I  
<br />
observed experiments on roughly a daily basis.
<br />
<p>Such experimental observations must be local and focal, circumscribed  
<br />
by circumstances that one can control.   The foundation of  
<br />
experimental works is always reproducibility.  Can we reproduce the  
<br />
same results tomorrow as we did today?
<br />
<p>The foundational issues are not local and focal.  The foundational  
<br />
issues are always of the nature of extension and intention.
<br />
If fact &quot;x&quot; is true locally, how can a global conclusion be  
<br />
inferred?  Or imputed?  Or computed?
<br />
Rene Thom was very direct about this problem in his various works.   
<br />
Attempts to infer global conclusion from local relations are popular  
<br />
sport in the several communities that are concerned with eternal  
<br />
questions.
<br />
<p>Frankly, I remain a skeptic on such matters.
<br />
Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry
<br />
<p>PS:  The recent book:  &quot;Re-discovering Physics&quot; by the Nobel Laurate  
<br />
Robert Laughlin (fractional Hall effect) gives a physical  
<br />
justification  for many of the positions I have taken and relied upon  
<br />
chemical arguments.  By the way, he argues against the plausibility  
<br />
of quantum computing as a practical technology...
