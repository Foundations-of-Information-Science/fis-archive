Dear Igor and Bob,
<br />
<p>Thanks for the scholarly piece --indeed it is a text full of interesting 
<br />
suggestions and directions of thought. The basic idea of distinguishing two 
<br />
dimensions in the relationship of socioeconomic systems with the 
<br />
sustainability goal looks a very promising avenue of discussion. (In what 
<br />
follows I am numbering the # paragraphs of the paper).
<br />
<p>In #1) we are said that the two dimensions, the &quot;organic&quot; (what about 
<br />
&quot;organizational&quot; instead? as organic is not used in its main sense 
<br />
referring to living organisms, it confuses a little) and the &quot;cognitive&quot;, 
<br />
both are maintained by dissipative processes (from Nature)... but it seems 
<br />
obvious that in very different way ---thus, why not putting the &quot;cognitive&quot; 
<br />
as a relatively immaterial &quot;info&quot; realm, with a clear difference in 
<br />
&quot;stuff&quot;, almost reminding the hard/soft distinction? It would appear, 
<br />
almost, as the &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, and I think it could help further 
<br />
refinement of that dimension in next paragraphs.
<br />
<p>About # 2), I would ask why increase in organization leads to higher 
<br />
ascendancy and power law distributions. Not necessarily, perhaps, as taking 
<br />
into account that almost all (modern) economies contain a mix of pioneer, 
<br />
advanced, mature, retarded, and obsolete sectors, then their respective 
<br />
dynamics and structures could contain different distribution signatures. 
<br />
(In ancient countries and economies, a number of distributions would fit 
<br />
power laws too, I bet, for another form to obtain power laws relates to 
<br />
Karl's partitions---very intriguingly, a &quot;partitional canon&quot; emerges when 
<br />
we allow complete partitional freedom on a natural number, with an exponent 
<br />
similar to the one appearing in most biological allometries: 3/4). Thus, 
<br />
growth and de-growth in incremental unitary parts would be highly 
<br />
characteristic of organisms and social organizations, &quot;per se&quot;.
<br />
<p>Maybe some clarification in #3 -- &quot;only&quot; autocatalysis leading to growth 
<br />
and centripetality?, no &quot;info&quot; domain associated? But in general I get 
<br />
along these #3 and #4.
<br />
<p>When the cognitive, immaterial, cultural dimension is decomposed further in 
<br />
#5, #6, and #7, I find the ternary scheme interesting, but somehow 
<br />
arbitrary. Quite many other general partitions could have been entered, or 
<br />
labeled differently (playing games with my students, we were capable of 
<br />
identifying on the order of 30 to 40 different collective identities we 
<br />
could be ascribed as members in today societies: familiar, parental, 
<br />
professional, unions, economic, religious, social, political, cultural, 
<br />
vecinal, urban, regional, national, sportive, recreational,  etc. etc.) 
<br />
Kenneth Boulding put it very elegantly: the organizational revolution of 
<br />
the 20th century. Well, one cannot reject the three levels proposed here, 
<br />
but...
<br />
<p>I find congenial # 8 and # 9 orientation, but fail to see that this goes 
<br />
any further from Lynn Whyte views in the 60's: &quot;The historical roots of our 
<br />
ecological crisis&quot;, on the domineering attitude upon nature imprinted by 
<br />
the Judeo Christian world view in Western countries. I would not quite 
<br />
agree with that either...  Historically several relatively complex 
<br />
civilizations have fallen into ecological collapse and disappeared (Jared 
<br />
Diamond, 2005). Also, I would not take as a very firm asset all the current 
<br />
&quot;knowledge based&quot; technobureaucratic slogans ---knowledge, as a conceptual 
<br />
espouse of information, suffers all kind of misunderstandings and abuses. 
<br />
Shouldn't we try to find new thinking avenues on the centrality of 
<br />
knowledge regarding this immaterial aspect?
<br />
<p>So, I quite agree with today's response to Loet:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps you may have an idea how to relate economic networks (as Bob and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself briefly addressed them), your vision of the knowledge-based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;economy, and the constraints arising from the dominant Western worldview. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This may be an interesting direction for further discussion...
</em><br />
<p><p>best regards
<br />
<p>Pedro
<br />
<p>PS. Thanks for the further comment on computers manufacturing and IT 
<br />
industry (and agrobusiness) burden on the environment.
