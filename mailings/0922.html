<p>
It is time for final statements -- the closing of both the session 
<br />
and the conference.
<br />
<p>I am sure we all join in thanking the hosts, facilitators, session 
<br />
monitors and of course all the contributors. My special thanks to 
<br />
contributors of the final section, given the difficulties of holidays 
<br />
and such.
<br />
<p>As to my own thoughts, I think that we need to reform our next 
<br />
iteration to support an evolved level of progress. What we have had 
<br />
so far is the electronic equivalent of not so much a conference as an 
<br />
unmediated workshop. What distinguishes a conference in my opinion is 
<br />
that participants bring work in progress; that work forms the basis 
<br />
for focused critiques and speculations.
<br />
<p>I believe FIS is about inventing a new science, and this type of 
<br />
expert, critical discussion on real work is required in order to 
<br />
understand the limits and tradeoffs of different approaches. The 
<br />
hosts of this e-conference envisioned a focused discussion on papers, 
<br />
but a review of the past couple years shows that most of the 
<br />
discussion drifted from these foci. Perhaps we should attempt this 
<br />
and beyond, possibly in a different form.
<br />
<p>We know enough about each other now to understand where we each come 
<br />
from. Nearly all of us are professionally engaged in the creation of 
<br />
this new science in our own ways. We may have gleaned as much as we 
<br />
can from this kind of lightweight interaction.
<br />
<p>I would vote for something like John H's second option: hosting 
<br />
several special interest groups each of which are engaged in actual, 
<br />
collaborative work, at least to the extent of creating a coherent 
<br />
document of the goals, philosophies, relative merits and tools 
<br />
involved. I think we can already imagine the few, naturally 
<br />
aggregated affinity groups among us. Probably some of us would join 
<br />
multiple groups.
<br />
<p>The public discussion would focus in turn on these group documents, 
<br />
commenting as much on the relative benefits of each compared to the 
<br />
others. In other words, I suggest we move more toward the original 
<br />
idea of focus on papers, and that those papers be growing statements 
<br />
of progress from focused groups doing real work. It will be much 
<br />
easier to arrange physical gatherings of focus groups than FIS as a 
<br />
whole, both because of the greater incentive and the simpler 
<br />
logistics.
<br />
<p>This could give us the best of two worlds: focus groups who drill 
<br />
deeper and faster, and FIS examinations that have more well formed 
<br />
documents for group consideration.
<br />
<p>An example: this week I considered posting a comment on Michael 
<br />
Leyton's work, as it has been mentioned a couple times. I've spent a 
<br />
good deal of time with his ideas; they exist both on an engineering 
<br />
level (with some novel new mechanics), and a higher rather radical 
<br />
level that he only mentions at the back of his books. In private 
<br />
discussions with Michael, I have come to understand that these 
<br />
radical views completely alter the relatively mundane engineering 
<br />
mechanics and provide a promising fertile new conceptual territory 
<br />
for FIS issues. These ideas are much like Koichiro's but deal with 
<br />
&quot;history&quot; rather than &quot;tense&quot; and have a tight binding with 
<br />
mathematical foundations. Along the way, the ambiguity of &quot;within&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;of&quot; is shifted to the scientist (as in psychiatry). Good 
<br />
opportunity for thirdness and semiosis consideration along the way 
<br />
but certainly not naturally.
<br />
<p>Difficult stuff. New. Not yet applied in an FIS context. But how to 
<br />
pose this sort of thing to the group as currently constituted? Only 
<br />
in a focus group could we wrangle with these notions in this form -- 
<br />
presenting some preliminary perspectives after time for a more 
<br />
general FIS critique. Several private email exchanges with FISers in 
<br />
past months have underscored in my mind the need for the bifurcation 
<br />
of focus: deeper work among groups, more focused general review.
<br />
<p>For this to happen, we need some few of us to volunteer as attractors 
<br />
for focus groups, not so much as senior member, but sustaining energy.
<br />
<p>Is this possible? Desirable?
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
