Ph. D.-Course 
<br />
Philosophy and Methodology of the Humanities, Natural and Social
<br />
Sciences: Commonalities, Differences, Subject areas and Methods
<br />
<p>International course, 5 days, 5 ETCS, Organizer: Søren Brier
<br />
(sbr.lpf&#64;cbs.dk), home page
<br />
( <a href="../../www.flec.kvl.dk/personalprofile.asp@id=sbr&p=engelsk">http://www.flec.kvl.dk/personalprofile.asp?id=sbr&amp;p=engelsk</a> )
<br />
Teaching: Søren Brier (sbr.lpf&#64;cbs.dk, 38152208) plus guest lecturers.
<br />
Time: 24.-28. May 2004. Place: Copenhagen Business School, Management,
<br />
Politics and Philosophy. Sign up latest 1. April to Karina Ravn Nielsen:
<br />
krn.lpf&#64;cbs.dk, or (+45) 38152208.
<br />
<p>The aim of the course is to make the Ph. D. student able to reflect
<br />
analytically on their projects subject area and the type of knowledge
<br />
involved in it as these often have a high complexity and
<br />
interdisciplinary character to day. Not only to be able to chose the
<br />
right methods, but also to be able weight the different types of
<br />
knowledge gained by the different types of analysis and measurements
<br />
against each other in the final conclusion. Which aspects do one want to
<br />
analyze? In what way can the result be combined and how far can they be
<br />
generalized? To think of how they can be combined and in which ways they
<br />
supplement each other considering the type and ideal of knowledge and
<br />
the subject area they represent. Thus this course gives a further
<br />
development of the foundation for reflexive thinking to the courses in
<br />
methodology.
<br />
<p>Nearly every research project these days has both theoretical, empirical
<br />
and practical knowledge aspects in it. Further the qualitative and the
<br />
quantitative methods deliver different kinds of knowledge. Some
<br />
researchers have for some time construed this, as you have to make a
<br />
choice between either qualitative or quantitative methods. Today it is
<br />
realized that you have to combine them and even various forms of them to
<br />
cover a complex area of knowledge. It helps to know how the different
<br />
types of &quot;optics&quot; have arisen historically? The course will also discuss
<br />
if it is possible to create a meta view of the relation between the
<br />
different types of knowledge in a discussion of what aspects of reality
<br />
is represented in humanities, science, social science, philosophy,
<br />
religion and politics.
<br />
Workload
<br />
The course demands reading the main part of three general books one from
<br />
each area describing the types and quality of knowledge produced there,
<br />
the limits and the strength and weakness of these kinds of knowledge and
<br />
one on a meta-view of them all. We will also read a book and some texts
<br />
on the theoretical and practical connections between the various
<br />
approaches to knowledge. I will try to keep it around a thousand pages.
<br />
It is necessary to read the material before the course.
<br />
Student are expected to produce questions to and discussion of the books
<br />
each leading a discussion in turn and each student will also make a
<br />
presentation of how the course problem area relates to his or hers
<br />
project and raise a discussion from those concrete problems.
<br />
<p>Form:
<br />
A typical day will have an introductory lecture with student questions
<br />
and discussion.
<br />
Then there will be presentation by two external lecturers with
<br />
discussion. After Lunch  presentation of problems to analyse in projects
<br />
by the Ph.D. students.
