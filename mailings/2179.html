          Dear Steven,
          <br />
          &nbsp;
          <br />
          I agree that there are obviously two usages of the word information: a group
          <br />
          of definitions akin to Shannon's mathematical definition and a group of
          <br />
          definitions which define information as &quot;what in-forms&quot; a system (Varela).
          <br />
          In the latter case, the system invests some meaning in the information or,
          <br />
          more generally, positions the information in its framework. Perhaps, one
          <br />
          could use the word &quot;observed information&quot; for this, while the
          <br />
          Shannon-information remains &quot;expected information.&quot;
          <br />
          &nbsp;
          <br />
          What I like best about Shannon's approach is the mathematical character
          <br />
          which frees us from specific semantics. When I read your mailings, for
          <br />
          example, it seems that I have to buy a whole philosophy if I wish to
          <br />
          understand it. From my perspective, this philosophy sounds like a
          <br />
          meta-biology (unlike a meta-physics). Biological systems theory has helped
          <br />
          us enormously in understanding how information can be stored into
          <br />
          information systems and thus provided with meaning (by codification along
          <br />
          the system's own axis). Social and psychic systems, however, can entertain
          <br />
          (and perhaps communicate) horizons of meaning. Thus, they obviously have
          <br />
          more degrees of freedom for processing information and meaning than
          <br />
          biological systems (while the latter are also embodied?).
          <br />
          &nbsp;
          <br />
          It seems to me that we need a kind of mathematical theory of meaning. How
          <br />
          can meaning be defined in the abstract, yet without giving it meaning with
          <br />
          reference to any body of knowledge other than the abstract one which is
          <br />
          contained, for example, in the mathematical theory of communication and its
          <br />
          elaboration into non-linear dynamics? Let me make a first proposal: expected
          <br />
          information can only be provided with meaning by information systems. I know
          <br />
          that this circular definition begs the question, but it is only meant as a
          <br />
          first step.
          <br />

          Subject: Re: [Fis] Re: What is information ?
          <br />
        <p>
        <p>Dear Loet,
          <br />
        <p>I have pointed out that this is exactly the area where I think the term
          <br />
          information is overloaded in common use and needs clarification.
          <br />
        <p>When we use the terminology &quot;a informs b&quot; we mean one convention contributes
          <br />
          to another - which appears quite different from the formal Shannon meaning.
          <br />
          This is because the term has in fact evolved along quite separate paths -
          <br />
          one in mathematics / computational science (informatique), the other in
          <br />
          philosophy / language and communication studies.
          <br />
        <p>I have argued that we cannot define the term information in isolation. We
          <br />
          really must make our model, our context, clear.
          <br />
        <p>In my own definition of the term information I mean that which identifies
          <br />
          cause and contributes to knowledge but I have this kludge around the
          <br />
          definition of the term knowledge that allows me to generalize and include
          <br />
          mechanics - I mentioned this earlier as something that I occasionally feel
          <br />
          uncomfortable about. :-)
          <br />
        <p>Recall I define knowledge as the determinant of action. So, in semeiosis,
          <br />
          knowledge is in the information that is embodied in the set of meaning
          <br />
          (itself the embodiment of traces of prior semeiosis) that determines the
          <br />
          behavior of an organism. In mechanics it is the set of information embodied
          <br />
          in prior cause that determines behavior - and I refer to this set as
          <br />
          super-knowledge. Which, as I say, occasionally makes me uncomfortable,
          <br />
          partly because at first it seems so cheesy. Think of it as unmediated
          <br />
          knowledge.
          <br />
        <p>The primary distinction between the two - and this is why I did it in the
          <br />
          first place - is that physically one deals with the engineering of sentience
          <br />
          and the other deals with mechanics - one involves sentient physical
          <br />
          structures formed around my notion of the affective primitive-of-experience
          <br />
          and the other does not. But the roles of both fit the same definition -
          <br />
          they are both determinants of action and this feels far from cheesy. It
          <br />
          allows me to generalize and unify my definitions of knowledge and behavior.
          <br />
        <p>So, by the above you can see how I can use the term information in both
          <br />
          cases. Since information is that which identifies cause and contributes to
          <br />
          knowledge (including super-knowledge). It is how sentient and mechanical
          <br />
          things know what to do next :-)
          <br />
        <p>At the purely physical level - in both cases, beit the engineering of
          <br />
          sentience or mechanics - information is physical difference and it
          <br />
          identifies cause and contributes to knowledge.
          <br />
        <p>When I say embodied, I mean exactly embodiment in the engineered physiology
          <br />
          of organism. Everything above reduces to a physical embodiment - the only
          <br />
          element that is not a part of currently accepted physical models is the
          <br />
          primitive-of-experience described earlier. Meaning (and all memory) is the
          <br />
          experience-of the physiological traces that are the product of prior
          <br />
          semeiosis - itself an embodied physical process - not the product of simple
          <br />
          mechanics but the product of the engineering of sentience by natural
          <br />
          selection in nature around the inert primitive-of-experience.
          <br />
        <p>When I use the term consciousness I define it as the &quot;conspiracy&quot; between
          <br />
          physiology and this primitive. Physiology characterizes sense in the
          <br />
          high-order experiences we are familiar with, semeiosis is the ongoing
          <br />
          recursive internal process that takes input directly as sense and from the
          <br />
          internal sense of embodied traces of prior semeiosis.
          <br />
        <p>Uncertainty and misunderstanding in communication between sentient entities
          <br />
          is simply the mismatch of embodied conventions.
          <br />
        <p>Information processing in this model has two forms - Turing / Shannon
          <br />
          computation and semeiosis - Again, one is the product of simple mechanics,
          <br />
          the other is the product of sentience engineering - the source of all
          <br />
          complexity.
          <br />

Dear Steven, 
 
Do you mean with &quot;embodied&quot; embodiments in biological bodies or in bodies of
knowledge. I find it very difficult to understand that meaning has to be
embodied if this is meant biologically. However, I can accept that meaning
is systemic and thus potentially different among bodies of knowledge.
 
How does this relate to information processing? If one distinguishes between
(Shannon-type) information processing and meaning-processing (e.g., in the
generation of knowledge), the uncertainty has to be positioned within the
meaning processing system as meaningful information (different from
Shannon-type information). Investing meaning to an information can then be
considered as an operation of the selecting system. The operation is
recursive: some meanings are more meaningful than others given a body of
knowledge. Knowledge can again be communicated as discursive knowledge. 
 
This is all relatively independent of the bodies involved. They provide the
historical conditions for an evolutionary process of expectations operating
selectively upon one another. Of course, the historical conditions matter
because they set the stage for this cultural evolution. 
 
With kind regards,

Dear Pedro and list,
Once again Pedro, I am in general agreement with your observations.
However, what you ask here is not merely for a simple definition of
information but the entire context in which such a notion can be founded.
Other definitions / notions are needed.  You must define what it is to
&quot;know&quot; - what meaning and prediction are, for example.  
I have explored this question somewhat - so let me put it out there as a
&quot;straw man.&quot;  This model takes my previous assertions regarding experience
as its premise.
In my model all metaphysics is the embodied content of experience.  
Meaning is the embodied trace of experience - the physiological structure
that characterizes a product of semeiosis.  Here is the cellular level
requirement - as yet determined, but let us point to neuroplasticity as a
possible example. Penrose might point to Orchestrated Objective Reduction as
another possible example - whatever, it doesn't matter at this point except
to observe that the model's architecture, when detailed, allows the
prediction of the engineering of that physiological structure.
Knowledge is the determinant of action.  That is, it is revealed in action,
in sentient entities it is the product of semeiosis over the embodied
meaning set.  We know how to walk by our innate embodiment of meaning - the
product of our genetics.  We know how to prove the Pythagoras theorem by
acquired embodied meaning.  We know how to communicate by speech because we
share a common acquired embodied convention (imperfectly).
Books, paintings, music are all marks - the subjects of signs.  Signs are
the embodied experience of marks.  The sun rise, the wind blowing, flower in
the field, are all marks.  Marks are either natural marks - the product of
physical laws - or they are metaphysical marks - the product of intent.
Intent is the meaning embodied by the creator of a metaphysical mark in its
creation.
Semeiosis is the ongoing experience of signs - both those embodied as the
traces of experience from past semeiosis and those that are the immediate
product of senses.
So, finally, what is information?  Information is that which informs - by
which we mean it identifies cause and adds to knowledge (see above
definition).  
In my model I generalize the notion of knowledge so that I can apply the
notion over inanimate/non-sentient cases - I know that this generalization
makes people uncomfortable, as it does me on occasion,  but it is by this
generalization that I can essentially define information simply as
&quot;difference&quot; in all cases and I can argue that a particle &quot;knows&quot; what
action to take as the product of information input.  This leads inevitably
to my notion of &quot;perfect action&quot; ... but that will side track us here.
For completeness I should also mention my prediction model.  Abduction is
the foundation of all prediction - it is the unfettered intuition.
Induction is the constraint of abduction by prior reductive experience - we
learn induction by taking apart the world and putting it back together.
Deduction is the constraint of induction by formal conventions (such as
mathematical logic) that we use in analysis and communication.
I hope this helps the discussion - I think I covered all Pedro's points.
With respect,
Steven
