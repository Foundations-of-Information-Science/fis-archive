My understanding of Andrei's position is that there are *both*
<br />
subjective and objective probabilities. This position justifies the 
<br />
quest for specific notion of quantum information theory.  On the other 
<br />
hand, some maintain that all probabilities are subjective. If this was 
<br />
so, ordinary information theory would be sufficient, and quantum 
<br />
probability theory would not be needed. A notable proponent of this view 
<br />
was Edwin T. Jaynes (<a href="../../bayes.wustl.edu/default.htm">http://bayes.wustl.edu/</a>) - his unfinished book
<br />
is very nice <a href="../../omega.albany.edu_3A8008/JaynesBookPdf.html">http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBookPdf.html</a> ( an edited 
<br />
version of it was later published by one of his collaborators 
<br />
<a href="../../www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-8431303-8078528@_255Fencoding=UTF8&asin=0521592712">http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-8431303-8078528?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;asin=0521592712</a> 
<br />
)
<br />
<p>* Infinite number of experiments required for Von Mises' probability
<br />
<p>It is easy to view subjectivity as problematic: it's a loaded word after 
<br />
all. Ultimately, as Koichiro says, we have objective observations. And 
<br />
objective probabilities can be estimated, after a large number of 
<br />
experiments. But in real world, we will not perform infinitely many 
<br />
experiments as to get to those precise probabilities. There is no point 
<br />
even trying this, as the experimental conditions will never be perfectly 
<br />
identical.
<br />
<p>* The subjective factor and models of models
<br />
<p>For an extremely well-defined experiment with many experiments, there 
<br />
will be overwhelming evidence for just one choice of probabilities. 
<br />
Thus, the factor of subjectivity is minimized. On the other hand, when 
<br />
there are few experiments, the subjective factor about what could those 
<br />
measurements mean becomes more important. The whole point of subjective 
<br />
probabilities is not to sweep this subjective factor under the rug, but 
<br />
to instead embrace it, make it explicit, make it a topic of discussion. 
<br />
We can learn a lot by building models of the assumptions, models of 
<br />
models, and not just the models of phenomena. I think such intellectual 
<br />
honesty and humility is a quality, not a deficiency.
<br />
<p>* The inability to distinguish true randomness from ignorance
<br />
<p>If we observe a non-deterministic dispersion of photons in the 
<br />
experiment, it is clear that the experiment is not truly repeatable. The 
<br />
*average* of the experiment is more or less repeatable, though. So what 
<br />
is the reason for the experiment not to be repeatable? Perhaps it is 
<br />
inherent stochasticity of nature - the true probabilities. But how do we 
<br />
know that the probabilities are true? Perhaps we cannot control the 
<br />
conditions of the experiment perfectly? Perhaps we don't know how to 
<br />
measure without interfering with the experiment? Perhaps we only measure 
<br />
a part of all that is there. The Copenhagen interpretation is about 
<br />
getting rid of the &quot;perhaps&quot; (because we don't know anyway) and just 
<br />
building a model of the objective results. When one doesn't have enough 
<br />
information to decide on one interpretation, then just toss the 
<br />
interpretation and calculate. As far as I am concerned, one should pick 
<br />
the interpretation that one is most comfortable with. Perhaps, however, 
<br />
one of the interpretations will be proven with some yet unknown technology.
<br />
<p>* Context and subjectivity
<br />
<p>I guess Andrei's contextual probabilities do capture a large part of 
<br />
what subjective probability is technically about. If the observer's 
<br />
assumptions (expressed as variables) are a part of this context, I'd 
<br />
call the resulting probabilities subjective.
<br />
