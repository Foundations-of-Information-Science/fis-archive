                    (To the List: I am re-posting my message to Karl because the original

                    <br />
                <p>I fear that I must once again disagree with your strong conclusions
                    <br />
                    about the relations between mathematics and genetics. I would urge
                    <br />
                    you to attempt to find exact correspondence relations between
                    <br />
                    empirical evidence and your views of models based on numbers.
                    <br />

                <p>Subject: [Fis] genetics: the most outstanding problem, SOLVED
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Dear Stan,
                    <br />
                <p>In your last posting, you said:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Of course, the origin of the genetic system is arguably the
                    <br />
                    most
                    <br />
                    outstanding problem facing natural science. It seems that, other
                    <br />
                    than the
                    <br />
                    (to me) unconvincing RNA World idea, there is no compelling model of it.
                    <br />
                <p>The model that the RNA (together with the DNA) is a sequence and that
                    <br />
                    the
                    <br />
                    genetic mechanism copies the information from a sequence (the dna/
                    <br />
                    rna) into
                    <br />
                    a nonsequenced assembly (the living organism) and from there (by
                    <br />
                    means of
                    <br />
                    the ovaries and the testes) back into a sequence is a quite compelling
                    <br />
                    model.
                    <br />
                <p>The term &quot;information&quot; has been shown in this chatroom to mean the
                    <br />
                    cuts that
                    <br />
                    segregate, separate and distinguish summands;
                    <br />
                    The term &quot;sequence&quot; has been defined by Peano;
                    <br />
                    The term &quot;nonsequenced /=commutative/assembly&quot; is indeed hairy, as there
                    <br />
                    exists no definition for multidimensional partitions, although this
                    <br />
                    is what
                    <br />
                    it means;
                    <br />
                    The term &quot;copies&quot; means a filter restriction on a set of entries into a
                    <br />
                    database (a restricted, in optimal case, bijective map between two
                    <br />
                    enumerations).
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>I certainly will not support this view of the relationships among
                    <br />
                    numbers, genetics and information.
                    <br />
                    I find your post to be outside the scope of the standard theories of
                    <br />
                    biochemistry and genetics.
                    <br />
                <p>Chemical information is grounded in the list of chemical elements and
                    <br />
                    the relations among them.
                    <br />
                    The terms &quot;DNA&quot; and &quot;RNA&quot; etc, are chemical names of specific
                    <br />
                    relationally rich bio-molecules.
                    <br />
                    The information content of chemical molecules must be expressed in
                    <br />
                    terms of atomic numbers and relations among the electrical particles
                    <br />
                    (graphs).
                    <br />
                    Biological information emerges as flows of changes of chemical
                    <br />
                    relations - metabolic dynamics.
                    <br />
                <p>In general, chemical structures / information does support transitive
                    <br />
                    relations among the atomic numbers organized into graphs.
                    <br />
                <p>Thus, if one wishes to develop a compelling argument about chemical
                    <br />
                    numbers and structures and genetic information, one should start
                    <br />
                    with relational algebras that keep track of changes of relations.
                    <br />
                <p>Bijective maps are not a suitable basis for describing change of
                    <br />
                    chemical relations and hence the flow on biological information.
                    <br />
                <p>Finally, if one wishes to describe a mathematics of biological
                    <br />
                    information, the suitable starting point is the fact that a single
                    <br />
                    position in a DNA sequence can control the fate of the entire
                    <br />
                    organism. A living system is a society of associative relations
                    <br />
                    among atomic numbers.
                    <br />
                <p>Cheers
                    <br />
