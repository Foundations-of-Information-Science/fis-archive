                <p>
                    Dear Jerry,
                    <br />
                <p>I will answer &quot;my part&quot; in green:
                    <br />
                <p>Igor writes (vol. 488, 6)
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A cell mechanism A adapts (measures) to the cell environment, which it is part of. During
                    this adaptation it increases its complexity and changes (by its very presence) the cell environment,
                    which thus also increases its complexity. Given that there are many such mechanisms (enzyme
                    catalyzed chemical reactions, organelles, membranes, etc), each mechanism increases its complexity
                    by reflecting on the presence of the totality of the other mechanisms.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;JLRC:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Reading your words from a 'big picture' frame of mind, I concur.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer to express the concepts in terms of the flow of electrical particles...
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be flow of electric particles, e.g.
                    &quot;measurement&quot; as exchange of electrons or radicals in chemical reactions, which leads to
                    saturations of concentrations of products and thus changes the environment;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be flow of photons, e.g. photosyntetic apparatus of green
                    plants &quot;measures&quot; the incident light by producing flow of protons further used in ATP
                    production and flow of electrons for NADPH production. These flows change, for example, the pH in
                    certain parts of chloroplast, which, in turn, changes the flows themselves, including the available
                    photon flow by, for example, epoxydation/deepoxydation of xantofills, &quot;screening&quot;
                    photosystems from light;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be flow of ions (changes in the state of the neuron
                    through activity of calcium and potassium channels
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be flow of genetic information, e.g. transcription of RNA
                    as a reaction to change in the cell environment, which leads to production of enzymes, which, in
                    turn, modify this cell environment (e.g. reaction to heat shock or to strong light)
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many more examples possible...
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases change, occuring as a reaction to a certain flow, is a measurement of
                    this flow, and it, in turn, forces the changes to this flow.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, one may say that most of these phenomena deal with either flows of charged particles
                    or photons. This is, however, trivial. Indeed, there exist only 4 force fields -- electromagnetic,
                    gravity, strong and weak. In case of living matter, at the level of description of biomolecular
                    networks, we deal only with the first one, with electromagnetic field. Hence, the only material
                    objects that really matter are those which interact with the electromagnetic field or are produced
                    by it, i.e. photons and charges (ions and electrons)
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;mechanism&quot; can be used in either a mathematical sense, a chemical
                    sense, or a general sense. In what sense is it being used in this paragraph?
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say &quot;mechanism&quot; I mean:
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chemical system of interactions between the
                    biomolecules, ions and quanta, NECESSARILY in the structural context, i.e. in the organelles and
                    compartments, where such interaction happen.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mathematical abstraction in the form of system of
                    equations for the biochemical networks, that represents our understanding of the above.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature as such does not know equations and networks, these are means of our
                    interpretation of what happens out there. I think that this is more or less in line with Robert
                    Rosen's views.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, in the narrative you provide, how does one create relations between
                    electrical particles and the dynamics of bionetworks? Although only a small number of different
                    electrical particles exist, how does one create the range of organisms in an ecosystem?
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;As it is known from the theory of systems (examples being Lorentz attractor and other
                    strange attractors, swarm theory, fractal structures, and many many more), it is quite possible to
                    develop very complex systems from very small number of simple elements. The source of this
                    complexity is the nonlinearity and instability of the system, or, in a more mathematical sense, the
                    positive Lyapunov exponential in a finite and bounded phase space. It is, for example, known, that
                    all possible patterns on the sea shells may be reproduced in modeling by means of a system of two
                    simple nonlinear equations (this was in Journal of Theoretical Biology some time in 1987). Please
                    also refer to the works of Karl Simms (&quot;virtual creatures&quot;) and works in experimental
                    mathematics of evolution by Chris Langton and other guys from Santa Fe institute.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument: One needs only 0 and 1 values for the bit to convey in a string of bits
                    as much information as one needs to.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we make such concepts EXACT such that they become a meaningful method of
                    scientific prediction? This is the challenge for bionetworks at all levels of perplexity. How does
                    individuality arise from such a narrative?
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that we are oftentimes dealing here with the unstable non-equilibrium
                    systems which are deterministic but unpredictable. This means that we cannot predict their behavior
                    but can explain it afterwards. A good example is the game of pool. It is absolutely impossible to
                    predict (before the stroke is made) exactly where each ball lands after the first stroke made into
                    the &quot;triangle&quot; of balls. However, all the interactions, of course, obey Newtonian laws,
                    and backward reconstruction of the process is possible. Same with evolution of biological systems
                    and, in a way, with bionetworks. Only general features of it may be probabilistically predicted. And
                    this is exactly how the individuality comes into picture. Had it not been for these instabilities
                    and extreme sensitivity to small variations in initial and boundary conditions, we would have been
                    all alike and all the same.
