PREVIOUS NOTE: a couple of fis collegues have privately asked me how to
<br />
send messages to our list: quite easy! just sending them to the address:
<br />
<p>fis&#64;listas.unizar.es
<br />
<p>they are automatically redistributed. You may use the &quot;reply&quot; function too:
<br />
your response is relayed to the whole list, not only to the original sender
<br />
of the message.
<br />
<p>Right now the fis list is absolutely open to anyone about any topic or
<br />
news. During the virtual conference a discussion scheme and perhaps some
<br />
other disciplinary rules will have to be implemented by the different
<br />
moderators &amp; teams --in this regard, trying different moderation &amp;
<br />
discussion schemes can be a very interesting experience thinking on future
<br />
attempts.
<br />
<p>------------------------------------
<br />
<p>INFO and MEANING
<br />
<p>About Tom압 last book, Information and Meaning, Springer 1997,
<br />
one can hardly disagree with the overall atempt: setting a conceptual
<br />
system bridging the gap in between our physical (chemical, biological,
<br />
etc.) knowledge and our own social environment. Information is the central
<br />
arch, but intelligence, meaning, consciousness, language, feedbacks,
<br />
resonance, etc. also play important roles (unfortunately, not always very
<br />
clearly established).
<br />
<p>About the starting point on information and energy, I would suggest going
<br />
to the Madrid 1994 Proceedings (BioSystems, 38, p. 151) where Welch refers
<br />
to the thermodynamic costs of molecular computing-- the dissipated energy
<br />
for one bit as equals to K.T . Perhaps I am wrong, but this seems the same
<br />
value than Tom압 for the relationship between entropy and information. So,
<br />
there might be no great thermodynamic novelties there (without denying that
<br />
Tom압 re-estatement is more suggestive and thought provoking).
<br />
<p>The new aspects of the book include fascinating comments about social
<br />
knowledge (eg, medieval Europe and China), origins of human language (info
<br />
proc. role of vowels and consonants in primates), and some hints about
<br />
consciousness putting together Edelman압 reentrant circuits with the
<br />
&quot;semantic metabolism&quot; analogy. Personally I find the metabolic analogy very
<br />
rich --well, maybe because myself am independently devoting some thought to
<br />
it in the BioSystems FIS sp. issue to appear. The tecno-utopian excursions
<br />
look far less interesting. Perhaps they are addressed to non-scientific
<br />
public.
<br />
<p>Far more considerations should have been introduced, particularly about
<br />
consciousness: time, molecular dimension, cellular internal architectures,
<br />
evolution &amp; brain organization, topology, etc. (sure that our coming
<br />
conference will show that!). Besides, very few references, if any, are made
<br />
to neuroscience models, schemes, theories, etc., that could be plausible
<br />
from the point of view of rigorous scientific reasoning (even Edelman is
<br />
only indirectly cited--he does not appear in the References list).
<br />
Frequently one can find trouble in the way Tom builds his thought based on
<br />
analogical reasoning. In this, it ressembles the way popular books are
<br />
written. That mixing of audiences may be a two edge sword. It can be very
<br />
dangerous for the sci. level of the book, but conversely it might bring a
<br />
large educated public to become interested in the info sci. topics.
<br />
<p>In my opinion, Tom압 views become a rather premature synthetic attempt. But
<br />
let us wait and see! I will be very glad to &quot;eat&quot; these critical comments
<br />
(fortunately they have virtual suport).
<br />
