Dear Bob,
<br />
<p>just a footnote to VEM (values, ethics, moral). There is a classic
<br />
distinction (also common in the English philosophic tradition) between
<br />
_ethics_ and _moral_. Moral (or morality, from Latin: _mos_ = customs,
<br />
traditions) concerns the living (!) traditions of a group or society. Every
<br />
society has its _moral_. _Ethics_ is a term reserved for the _reflection_ on
<br />
moral. It can be, for instance, a _descriptive_ reflection, or a
<br />
_critical_one or a _metareflection_ (in the case when we talk about the
<br />
_language_ of moral = _metaethics_).
<br />
As far as the term _value_ is concerned, it was introduced in Philosophy
<br />
particulary in the 19th century with regard to economic theories. A _value_
<br />
is something to be set by someone who is interested in _quantifiyng_ a
<br />
particular thing. In a metaphoric (!) sense we use this term when we talk
<br />
about _ethical values_ although this _values_ (for instance, love or
<br />
solidarity, or life, or friendship etc.) by no means can be _e-valuated_ in
<br />
an economic sense (or, in case we do it, they loose their specificity...).
<br />
In ancient philosophy there was, for instance, the term _agathos_ (Greek:
<br />
good) (or, _arete_ which means the quality of something to perform
<br />
efficiently an activity, and which was used particularly by Aristotle to
<br />
design the _human_ arete, consisting in living according good _thinking_).
<br />
_Agathos_ and _bonum_ are terms used in pre-modern philosophy for
<br />
designating the quality of something in itself (non-dependent of a _subject_
<br />
that _evaluates_ this according to his/her particular interest). So VEM is a
<br />
very tricky formulation for designing very different things.
<br />
kind regards
<br />

Betreff: Re: Social Information
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;ON THE NATURE OF SOCIAL INFORMATION
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If information is the measure of reduced uncertainty an observer has about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the world, then social information is the measure of a society*s reduced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty.  I know several of you will be uncomfortable with that because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are convinced that only humans can be observers.  But I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observation is simply interaction, and interaction can take place between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;every kind of element and system, provided there is an energy gradient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;available.  There is a record or trace left of an interaction, however,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only when some structure can be noticeably changed as a result of a flow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;across a frontier.  The record of an interaction, which provides a kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*map* of the observed, is the alterations in internal components and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships defining the observing structure.  When the structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associated with information are living systems, if not exclusively human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beings, neural networks or similar brain-related tissues are altered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;These material media store memories about encounters between organisms and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Societies also store memories, but not always in material media.  There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material records, of course, in the forms of tools, art works, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;documents.  But societies also store information in rituals and rites,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social roles and institutions, languages and myths.  Recording interactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the world in, e.g., social roles means that it is changed human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behaviors which store social information.  Of course, humans can change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their behaviors individually, spontaneously, and for their own private
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasons.  But if we imagine spontaneously changing individuals in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isolation, then it is clear the record of these changes can be stored in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their separate brains and bodies.  However, if these individuals are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;members of societies, then their behavioral variations may affect how*and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even whether*others live.  The records of these actions will then be stored
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in external systems, like symbol systems and organized group behaviors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The recording media change because it is information about the groups, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the individuals in them, which now to has be stored.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The existence of these records indicates that information about social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collectives is qualitatively different from the biological information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stored in genes and tissues.  Collectives are not always easy to perceive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;especially if you are burdened with an Anglo-American sensibility.  But it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;takes only a moment to appreciate how societies could self-organize, on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one hand, and have effects on the world and their components which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;permanently transform both.  If that is so, then the structure of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-organized society is itself the embodiment of social information, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the social structure remembers, through replicated rituals and rites, roles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and institutions, languages and myths, how much the group*s uncertainty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about a transformed environment was reduced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Societies self-organize when the number of human interactions pass a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;threshold and, suddenly, become interconnected wholes greater than the sum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of their parts.  This is not mystical, for if synergies between people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;release energy into an environment which has effects disproportional to its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causes, feedback from the environment *selects* the whole.  Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generated bottom-up by interacting people, once organized societies have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;top-down effects on their constituents.  The whole sustains itself by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recording what it, the society, knows about the world.  That cannot be done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the brains and bodies of people, for then we would have lots of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information about yous and mes but no information about the us shared in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;common.  The most obvious example is the invention of agriculture, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;released energies able to sustain an exploding population that was trapped,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ever after, in the Iron Cage of its own making.  For an expanded population
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could not survive by following its biological injunctions*it survived by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sustaining the agricultural system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For agricultural systems to survive it was necessary to communicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;messages to all of their members describing how they must restrict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of possible behaviors available to them biologically*fight, flight,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mate, sleep, eat, etc*in favor of a circumscribed set of behaviors.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;latter is essential because it is only by practicing selected behaviors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the social network on which all depend is reconstituted.  Only if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people counted on to dig ditches, say, did so regardless of how tired they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were or of how little return they got on their labor could those who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ploughed fields expect to have the water needed to ripen crops, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;soldiers, scribes, and artisans needed to perform the tasks on which ditch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;diggers depended.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is important to realize that there is nothing in our biology that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires digging ditches, say, and little in the outcomes of early
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;civilizations to seduce people into such endless labor. People performed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these jobs because their societies obliged or forced them to, which is why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Spencer called early forms of correlated human behaviors *coercive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cooperation.* Being restricted to a narrow set of externally determined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behaviors by the whole to which a person belongs is playing a *social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;role.*  Social roles record what societies know about collective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;People learn how to play social roles as members of societies, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assimilating the information stored in their structures.  Social roles are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communicated to people, in the first instance, by reenactments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;successful collective enterprises, typically dances or games, which, over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time, become rituals and rites.  Once the behaviors appropriate to a social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;role become clear, however, they could be institutionalized by blows and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shouts.  Blows and shouts are not subtle means of communicating but they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be effective, especially if people could be locked into particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behaviors and, thereafter, simply required to repeat them.  Simple social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems self-organized in stable and benign environments survived by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;confining people to rigidly prescribed behaviors for long periods of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if individuals varied their behavior they sometime found more effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ways to exploit nature, and the increased flow of resources would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;required more specialized roles and more intimate relations to process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Environmental changes can have similar effects, of course.) Processing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increased flows by telling generations upon generations to perform the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tasks would no longer be adequate, for there would be new tasks to perform
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and many different ways to perform them.  Thus, more, and more complex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;messages would have to be sent.  People might have to be taught to alter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their social roles or at least to vary some of their outputs as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;circumstances changed.  Sending more messages and more complex ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;required developing new media for communicating.  Rather than telling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people exactly what to do, societies needed to equip them with the ability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to figure out not only what role to play but which variant of the role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applied, how intensely to apply it, etc.  Then people could guide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves*and still sustain the interacting network on which all depended.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To communicate information about complex actions, repeating messages was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not enough.  New forms of redundancy were required.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For people to guide themselves they needed to anticipate how the collective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environment would respond to structural alterations in a society caused by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;varied individual behaviors.  Anticipations require the use of mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models, which in this case would be views of the social wholes to which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individuals belonged.  Typically, it is an axiom of systems theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;while wholes can observe parts, parts cannot observe wholes.  So providing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a god*s-eye view was not easy.  But when Values, Ethics, and Morals (VEMs)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emerged a device was at hand.  VEMs symbolically represented morally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;significant end-states and provided rules for arriving at*or avoiding*them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pursuing those states according to the prescribed rules leads individuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to judge their own actions and make meaningful choices between options.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;VEMs are symbolic representations of the roles members of societies play,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which roles themselves are behavioral representations of the worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;societies create.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maps of the behaviors that map the world, VEMs are quintessential social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information.  Because they are not records of personal experiences, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be communicated in terms of sensations of pleasure and pain, VEMs are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new kinds of information.  The knowledge of good and evil, VEMs symbolize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what actions *mean* and then harness sensations of pleasure and pain in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pursuit of socially beneficial behaviors.  VEMs only emerge after the phase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change from nomadic scavengers to sedantic farmers takes place, after a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;context in which individual actions have collective effects self-organizes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The context, of course, is the social whole, and actions which tend to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sustain it are *good* while those tending to destabilize it are *bad.*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;VEMs make the evolution of more complex societies possible because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contextualize messages.  Messages which contextualize information are much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more dependable, for they give receivers clues on how to decode them and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thus increase the probabilities that the sender*s intention will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;achieved.   When communication systems improve, social systems can access
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many more states, process different kinds of flows, and make more efficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use of resources.  But securing messages depends on providing individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decision makers with the ability to, imaginatively, rise above their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;station and view the social whole.  Thus, VEMs are metaphorical periscopes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recording the reduced uncertainty societies have about their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environments*which uncertainty VEMs keep to a minimum by constraining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human behaviors.  This kind of information also helps people reduce their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty about each other and themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;VEMs demonstrate that social information exists, is a measure of reduced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty, and has no agency.  Social information should not be reified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and does not DO anything.  But it does record the emergence of new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers*social systems rather than biological, chemical, or physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ones...
