<p>
Ted,
<br />
<p>Plaudits for opening (or is it closing?) the kimono. 
<br />
<p>You remarked:
<br />
<p>&lt;I think Koichiro's proposal, if I understand it right is equally
<br />
&lt;radical, to move the notion of &quot;time&quot; outside the framework of
<br />
&lt;information, turning it into the metatool for the new science: a
<br />
&lt;grammar for information.
<br />
<p>One of the intriguing foreground questions is the entanglement
<br />
of time language and information. In quotidian experience
<br />
there is a Bermuda triangle (somewhere at the confluence of circadian
<br />
chronological and psychological time) in which time meets information
<br />
as they disappear together down the wormhole of relevance. 
<br />
Yesterday's news is dwindling information and attention is predicated 
<br />
on timeliness and timing (rather than good old Father Time). 
<br />
<p>Two questions emerge.
<br />
<p>1. How then does info-time relate to the dimension of spacetime?
<br />
Is it (as for Edwina) an extension of material forms or 'more
<br />
than a tweak' in the materio-reductionist cosmogony? 
<br />
<p>2 If information has a 'syntax' which language theory is 
<br />
appropriate for the crafting of our metatool? 
<br />
Or do we invent our own?
<br />
<p>Is Koichiro's promising notion a metaphor borrowed from 
<br />
descriptive grammar or is it grounded in linguistic science? 
<br />
(Bohm's 'rhematics' is an example of a half-baked linguistic 
<br />
theory which went nowhere).
<br />
<p>Shannonists will probably be more comfortable with MIT and
<br />
the Chomskyites, the cyberneticians with Peirce.
<br />
Others will feel more at home with Vygotsky or the nonlinear 
<br />
tense of Whorf's Hopi Indians.
<br />
<p>Koichiro's view that information is 'a broadcast with a tense'
<br />
is not far removed from Bohm's active/passive voice metaphor.
<br />
<p>Is this gerundive time like the flickering frames of a cinematic 
<br />
continuum 'project-ed' onto the screen of spacetime? 
<br />
Avoidance of the particulate &quot;the&quot; word is to
<br />
be applauded (&quot;the past, the present, the future&quot; retired
<br />
in favour of passing presenting project-ing).
<br />
<p>As Borges said &quot;Time (like information) is 
<br />
the river which carries me along but I am 
<br />
the river&quot;. 
<br />
<p>Maybe a future model for FIS is a network of SIG's
<br />
to explore some of these fascinating issues next
<br />
time round and possibly come up with a suite of
<br />
metatools for the New Science. 
<br />

Subject: A Proposal for Wrapping Up
<br />
<p><p>Friends--
<br />
<p>I was expecting more discussion on Jerry's challenge. If I understand
<br />
it right, it is quite radical and reflects just the sort of high
<br />
level controversy I suggested we examine before we wrap up.
<br />
<p>On one side, we have Jerry and a few others (I count myself here) who
<br />
claim that we need more than a tweak in existing paradigms, but whole
<br />
new abstractions, even whole new manners of abstraction. Opposed are
<br />
the vast majority of FISers who propose shifts of perspectives or new
<br />
metaphors within existing abstractions. The fulcrum of this
<br />
difference seems to be what approach one prefers for &quot;escaping&quot; the
<br />
foreground/background problem of &quot;information.&quot; (I also admit that
<br />
when reading some of these clever more pragmatic positions, I find
<br />
them compelling as well.)
<br />
<p>I suggest we log this as a worthwhile issue to be examined by future
<br />
activities. Let me propose some other grand controversies I perceived
<br />
in the prior discussion.
<br />
<p>I think Koichiro's proposal, if I understand it right is equally
<br />
radical, to move the notion of &quot;time&quot; outside the framework of
<br />
information, turning it into the metatool for the new science: a
<br />
grammar for information. Some others independently developed this
<br />
notion -- it appeared in several forms during the discussions of
<br />
entropy, but the last few months have seen little of this radical
<br />
position, and the default discussion context seems to not attempt
<br />
something so expensive theoretically.
<br />
<p>Periodically, another religious difference creeps in and then damps
<br />
down. I think we are roughly divided between those who consider the
<br />
first class citizen of information to be the &quot;message&quot; (and all of
<br />
its surrogates), while others propose a citizen based on &quot;context,&quot;
<br />
situated functionality or &quot;system awareness.&quot; There are many
<br />
denominations on both sides of this chasm, unless I'm mistaken.
<br />
<p>This divide is reflected in one superficially similar: the preferred
<br />
lever. Some champion &quot;societal&quot; even &quot;cultural/emotional&quot;
<br />
perspectives, while others cling to chemical or biological focii to
<br />
&quot;inform&quot; societal dynamics. This seems a profound difference to me,
<br />
so profound it colors everything.
<br />
<p>In reviewing the last few years' messages (pretty vast, actually)
<br />
many seem occupied with similar basic religious divides, but the
<br />
ordinary problems of language, meaning and reality that have occupied
<br />
many great minds -- minds concerned more with discovery and
<br />
understanding than invention. I cannot say whether those are
<br />
reflections of the meatier controversies of our new agenda, the other
<br />
way around or relatively irrelevant distractions. I suspect the
<br />
latter.
<br />
<p>Well, I think Pedro has allocated us another week or so to wrap this
<br />
up. Does anyone feel it beneficial to identify these types of
<br />
outstanding differences? Whether I have dissected the discussion
<br />
correctly is another issue, and I defer to more capable colleagues to
<br />
replace my suggestions with better ones.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
