Ted,

<p>You wrote:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&lt;My point was that most workers in logic have many different logics. 
<br />
&lt;All are invented for different purposes and distort the reality they 
<br />
&lt;represent and about which they reason.
<br />
<p>I agree that 'logics' are legion. The distortion occurs in the expression
<br />
(language) and in the rational process (thought). The corollary is that all
<br />
information may be in fact misinformation (distortion of reality)
<br />
be it the myth of Oedipus, Seven Day Creationism or Superstring theory.
<br />
<p>Remember that old trickster Hermes is the patron god of libraries and messengers.
<br />
<p>The flow of information (like the arrow of time) is an illusion.
<br />
<p>There is no empirical evidence for a logically necessary link between 'information' and
<br />
data, knowledge or truth or for the instantiation of 'information' in rational
<br />
processes (or computing). An informational experience is notoriously good or bad 
<br />
according to its perceived usefulness not its logicality. 
<br />
<p>&lt;We are talking about...
<br />
<p>&lt;4. How the entities involved &quot;express and reason about how things work&quot;
<br />
<p>I support your emphasis on what information (and its conceptual family) does rather 
<br />
than what it speculatively is or means. An example might be the way Don Norman picked up 
<br />
on JJ Gibson's notion of affordance and incorporated it into the practice of computer design.
<br />
<p>Our first task is to identify the substratum of supervenient entities with family resemblances
<br />
to our long lost cousin information rather than attempt to formulate a reductionist
<br />
Grand Unifying Theory. Intelligent fragmentation of views is inevitable.
<br />
<p>As an aside how do you incorporate into your Fourth Domain non-linear concepts
<br />
like turbulence, rhythmic entrainment, dynamic coherence, affordance and agility
<br />
- all those intriguing mental models which have emerged in recent times
<br />
&nbsp;to enhance and develop (but not overthrow) First Order Logic?
<br />
<p>How do we ground expression/reason in 'how things work'?
<br />
<p>How do we make moves on the chessboard if we are the pieces in the game?
<br />
First Order Logic is like the notation on the scoresheet of a previous match -
<br />
good for postgame analysis but not for mate in two. Peircean anthropo-logic
<br />
only gets us partially into informational relationships (say through
<br />
the opening gambits not into the intuitive middle-game).
<br />
<p>My personal theory (at the risk of spamming the conversation) is that we 
<br />
(and possibly all living organisms) qua species informationis relate to each other 
<br />
and to the Umwelt cinematically rather than computationally. 
<br />
<p>We pan towards meaning, focus empathetically or zoom in and out of conversations.
<br />
Informational experiences provide us with 'shots' which make varying degrees of sense.
<br />
<p>If I'm not misinformed, the emergence of the camera both reflects and furthers 
<br />
the epistemiologic development of homo sapiens. Computational posthumanism (Fredkin, Hayles)
<br />
is really digital reductionism and we cannot unravel the plot of information
<br />
by categorical logic or semantics alone.

<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is really have some difficulty to understand how we can think that

<p>Fenzl--
<br />
<p>(My second posting this week. Limiting to two seems a good rule.)
<br />
<p>We are talking about four domains here:
<br />
<p>--1. How things actually work
<br />
<p>--2. How things appear to work
<br />
<p>--3. How we express and reason about how things work
<br />
<p>--4. How the entities involved &quot;express and reason about how things work&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina used the term &quot;logic&quot; in the context of Socratic caves, 
<br />
Aristotle and Peirce. She used terms like &quot;rational&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;reasonable.&quot; To my mind (and many I presume) her use of the term 
<br />
puts her use in domain 3. My point was that most workers in logic 
<br />
have many different logics. All are invented for different purposes 
<br />
and distort the reality they represent and about which they reason.
<br />
<p>You used the term &quot;logic&quot; in such a way that means (I think) that 
<br />
there is some coherent set of laws in domain 1 that result in 
<br />
reproducable effects. That's different.
<br />
<p>As common terms of art in computer science, I use &quot;mechanics&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;physics&quot; for domain 1, and &quot;logic&quot; variously for the rest. I believe 
<br />
there is a large distance of abstraction among these four. Edwina at 
<br />
least believes 2 and 1 are the same or close and &quot;logic&quot; covers both. 
<br />
Whatever you choose is a religious decision, but there are tens of 
<br />
thousands of places where you can recount what people said about the 
<br />
the relationships among 1, 2 and 3. I suppose it has pedagogical 
<br />
value, but that Christmas tree is pretty well decorated.
<br />
<p>I interpret the FIS to agenda to be concerned with domain 4 and 
<br />
relationships with the others. There are very few forums for this, so 
<br />
I suppose the focus here to be worth preserving.
<br />
<p>I can even claim some small role in &quot;creating&quot; a logic myself. Twenty 
<br />
years ago a problem somewhat similar to the FIS one was defined in 
<br />
terms of the restrictions of existing logics. We specified 
<br />
characteristics of a new logic to design, and essentially established 
<br />
a research center to do so. I played a minor role in the problem 
<br />
identification and arranging the funding. The center is still strong 
<br />
at Stanford. The project was led by our probably greatest living 
<br />
logician at the time (who died last year). The logic is &quot;situation 
<br />
logic,&quot; which at his death was being extended to &quot;channel logic&quot; to 
<br />
address something much like domain 4.
<br />
<p>Whatever we invent, it will likely be algebra-friendly and exploit 
<br />
group theory. The route of abstraction among the four domains 
<br />
(especially 3 and 4) must be formally specified; I am hopeful that 
<br />
category theory will guide that.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
