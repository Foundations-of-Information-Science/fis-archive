<p>Thanks Gyorgy! A good first word is always really helpful when

explaining something new. This is the most like-minded group of

scientists I have ever presented this model to. It is a very fundamental

method of understanding and worth analyzing carefully.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call a thermodynamic approach, and) this may represent a grouping

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach - if I did not misunderstand his definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Globally:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in thermodynamic terms:  symmetry and entropy increase, while order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decreases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in symmetric terms:   all symmetry, order and entropy increase.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Locally:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in thermodynamic terms:   order increases, while symmetry decreases 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and entropy may decrease.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in symmetric terms:   order and symmetry decrease, and entropy may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also decrease. 
</em><br />
<p>Yes, globally and locally. Excellent clarification. One always must 
<br />
consider frame of reference. A dense gas inside a box is grouping order 
<br />
in reference to a (global) frame of reference beyond the box. In a frame 
<br />
reference limited to the box (locally), the gas is evenly distributed 
<br />
which is symmetry order. Of course the two orders can be re-applied to 
<br />
any isolated or limited frame of reference. All the grouping internally 
<br />
within a grocery store, or library, is also grouping referenced to the 
<br />
global or exterior landscape, i.e., all the books in one place of a city.
<br />
<p>As an example of an extreme reference shift, the squares of a 
<br />
checkerboard can be moved so all the white squares are on one side and 
<br />
all the black are on the other, so each half of the board is then one 
<br />
color, the extreme of grouping order in a global reference. If we then 
<br />
limit our reference frame to a single side of the board we find 
<br />
ourselves inside a perfect symmetry of one solid color. Note that half 
<br />
of the extreme of grouping order has properties identical to perfect 
<br />
symmetry order. Both are uniform. All positives combined together create 
<br />
a singularity compared to all of the positives and negatives combined 
<br />
together creating a singularity. Our dimension of cosmological size is 
<br />
completely in respect to these extremes. The point of the bang is 
<br />
unimaginably small, while absolute zero is unimaginably large. Yet it is 
<br />
accepted knowledge that a geometrically flat universe (WMAP) is always 
<br />
infinitely extended, even at time zero. Some have confused the Alpha 
<br />
state of the bang as perfect symmetry for this very reason. The point of 
<br />
the big bang is a singularity only within a limited reference frame. 
<br />
Beyond that reference frame it is a duality, all positive, half of the 
<br />
whole. Time invariably begins from that state because time is 
<br />
probabilistic, which means that time or change moves toward balance. 
<br />
Thus the history of any system in a state of imbalance or asymmetry will 
<br />
inevitably trace back to an ever greater extreme of imbalance.
<br />
<p>Before it becomes an issue, randomness or irregularity can be best 
<br />
considered in two dimensions, with dots along an invisible straight 
<br />
line. The dots can be evenly spaced or grouped in the reference frame. 
<br />
If evenly spaced, moving any dot reduces symmetry but increases grouping 
<br />
order. Any direction away from grouping increases symmetry order. The 
<br />
extremes in this scenario should be obvious by now, all overlapped in 
<br />
one place versus thinned out into a continuous line.
<br />
<p>What I am saying in general is that the entire spectrum of what is 
<br />
possible exists between the two extremes, grouping and symmetry. Again 
<br />
this is something we all are familiar with but don't commonly apply in 
<br />
this way. We all know this fact as the concept of contrast. We can 
<br />
increase the contrast of any image until it becomes two colors, white 
<br />
and black, OR ELSE all the colors and shades of the image can be blended 
<br />
together evenly which reduces the contrast to a minimum and turns the 
<br />
image gray, a single uniform color. In reference to matter, at any 
<br />
average measure of density, there is the extreme of a perfectly smooth 
<br />
distribution (low contrast or symmetry order) but also there is the 
<br />
extreme of a lumpy distribution (highest possible contrast or grouping 
<br />
order) in any reference frame. I call this the contrast gradient, a 
<br />
spectrum of possibilities bounded by two extremes. The space of all 
<br />
possible states is actually bounded in all directions by extremes, 
<br />
smooth and lumpy at any specific average density, and cosmic extremes of 
<br />
the infinitely dense point of the bang (Alpha) and the flat zero density 
<br />
space of absolute zero (Omega), which is a density gradient. The course 
<br />
of time then is from Alpha to Omega along the density gradient (not from 
<br />
order to disorder) but that course follows a basin of attraction 
<br />
balanced between the smooth universe and lumpy universe extremes 
<br />
(contrast gradient). Note that systems settling into an equilibrium 
<br />
state do so in short-time durations in respect to the contrast gradient, 
<br />
not the density gradient, which contributes to why a dense gas spreading 
<br />
throughout a room spreads out in an irregular pattern. This while the 
<br />
overall universe generally moves toward a complete equilibrium in deep 
<br />
time. 
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The two order-disorder concepts contradict to each other - although 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both are applied in their own domains. 
</em><br />
<p>Indeed Gyorgy, this is a very significant issue, the two distinct and 
<br />
contradictory conceptual domains. Very interesting. Very profound. The 
<br />
distinctiveness of each is most visible when two orders is applied to 
<br />
mathematics in general. Each order derives it's own mathematical system 
<br />
of comprehension. Each is a different perspective of reality. Science 
<br />
presently perceives the universe mainly from the perspective of  
<br />
grouping order, naturally so. It is the pronounced form of order we 
<br />
naturally observe and need biologically to survive and prosper. So 
<br />
uniformity becomes disorder. We see the world as materialistic, as many 
<br />
separate things all of which are arisen above nothing. We count things, 
<br />
one two three, more than zero things. The nature of grouping order is 
<br />
form and definition, the finite world. From our current perspective, 
<br />
matter is seen as being more than empty space, materialism, 
<br />
reductionism, looking at the world from the bottom-up.
<br />
<p>However, when switched into a perspective derived form symmetry order 
<br />
everything changes. The axiom of nothing disappears, since zero becomes 
<br />
the balanced whole. On either side of that scale you only have lesser 
<br />
positives and lesser negatives. Identical but opposite. Matter and 
<br />
anti-matter. Material form suddenly becomes less than a full uniform 
<br />
space. Although science has begun to recognize the vacuum is not empty 
<br />
we still normally assume empty space is a nothing, but empty space 
<br />
technically is simply uniformity. Paint the universe all one color, 
<br />
white, it becomes uniform and nothing is visible, but it still exists. 
<br />
Commonly we confuse the word nothing with nonexistence when in fact 
<br />
nothingness is a physical property, existent, applied properly only to 
<br />
the analogy of a white canvas, i.e., uniformity. Ugly symmetry! In this 
<br />
symmetry order perspective all that we know is less than everything, not 
<br />
more than nothing. Rather than seeing matter as fundamental and space as 
<br />
the extension of mass, we recognize in this mode that space is 
<br />
fundamental and mass is the curvature of space. Particles become holes 
<br />
in full space. And what we know of a universe is like existing within a 
<br />
figure eight, the curvature of space extends inversely beyond a 
<br />
collapsed point. The mirror universe that balances the equation and 
<br />
makes the Universe whole, all of which is only visible when looking at 
<br />
the universe from the top-down.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are also other aspects of the classification of order/disorder, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetric/asymmetric relations and the arrow of the change of entropy: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these are whether we investigate global or local (actual or potential) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes.
</em><br />
<p>In my writings I have applied two orders mainly to cosmology by 
<br />
exploiting the issue of extremes, which allowed me to discretely model 
<br />
all possible states. There is too much to explain here in short but the 
<br />
product is a zero centered cosmology where time and all forces of nature 
<br />
are recognized to be probabilistic. I also have applied two orders to 
<br />
mathematics, developing a very surprising value system where positive 
<br />
and negative values combine rather than cancel.
<br />
<p>Once fully understood it seems odd that the grouping and symmetry order 
<br />
distinctions aren't standard knowledge. It shows how young we are still. 
<br />
But hey, it's good to be young.
