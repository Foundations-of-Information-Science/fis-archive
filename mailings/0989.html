Hi Ted,
<br />
<p>Thanks for bringing us back to our sheep.
<br />
<p>You commented;
<br />
<p>&lt;In the FIS context, &quot;music&quot; can be characterized as having 
<br />
&lt;illogical content that relates in an orderly way in the receiving 
<br />
&lt;mind. Therefore the mechanics of music in humans is more &quot;natural,&quot; 
<br />
&lt;and more apt to inform us about the types of communications among 
<br />
&lt;molecules, even though that statement carries Theosophical overtones.
<br />
<p>I think that nicely summarises Frank Zappa's observation that
<br />
<p>'a composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will on unsuspecting 
<br />
air molecules, often with the assistance of unsuspecting musicians.'
<br />
<p>This quote applies equally well to your societal analogy if you substitute
<br />
'politician' for 'composer' and 'citizens' for 'air molecules' -
<br />
and maybe 'scientists' for 'musicians :)
<br />
<p>As a coda to your intermezzo I can't help wondering why informational
<br />
experiences at molecular social and personal levels often present as
<br />
incidental music rather than program pieces - messages carried
<br />
from Point A to Point B.
<br />
<p>This explains why the question 'What is Information?' has hitherto not been
<br />
of central concern to science (compared to say less incidental
<br />
entities like matter, truth and justice).
<br />
<p>&lt;the FIS list often goes off on tangents from the programmed topic, usually productively.&gt;
<br />
<p>Could this be an informational power law underlying human communication - as elliptic and
<br />
tangential as an Anglo-Saxon conversation, a jam session with Charlie Bird Parker
<br />
or the 'dialog among molecules'?
<br />
<p>Can we fully understand music without first exploring those nebulous entities 
<br />
soul, spirit and psyche - which (if Heisenberg is to be believed) are 
<br />
natural extensions of the physical world.
<br />
<p>I enjoyed Juan's lucid paper very much - particularly where
<br />
he explored the borderline between language and music.
<br />
I was not so convinced by his attempt to 'force' a 'message-based',
<br />
processing theory of information on top of it.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From my perspective 'information' is not just matter and form but
</em><br />
a (possibly elliptic) movement between a place of absence and a place of presence
<br />
(just as the cipher '2' is not just a fixed position but
<br />
implies a movement away from 'oneness' and towards 'threeness').
<br />
<p>To ignore that may lead us to philosophical and political 'tokenism'.
<br />
Can we really have a theory of information without a 'deictic moment'?
<br />
To paraphrase theology - can we have the 'Truth and the Light' without
<br />
'The Way'?
<br />
<p>The French philosopher Bruno Latour is worth a read on this:
<br />
<a href="../../www.ensmp.fr/~latour/articles/article/064.html">http://www.ensmp.fr/~latour/articles/article/064.html</a> 
<br />
<p>'On voit que l'information n'est pas une &quot;forme&quot; au sens platonicien du terme,
<br />
mais un rapport très pratique et très matériel entre deux lieux dont le premier 
<br />
négocie ce qu'il doit prélever dans le second afin de le tenir sous le regard 
<br />
et d'agir à distance sur lui.' 
<br />
<p>['information is a very practical and material relationship between 
<br />
two places the first of which negotiates what it needs to remove from the
<br />
second in order to keep it under its notice and at the same time act on it remotely']
<br />
<p>For Latour this dialectic explains the vicarious power of artefacts (inscriptions) 
<br />
- scientific or musical notation, literature - as well as that of libraries, 
<br />
museums and laboratories.
<br />
<p>Your post and Juan's intro have announced some interesting themes.
<br />
<p>After the overture I'm looking forward to the concert.
<br />
<p>Tangentially,
<br />
<p>John H

Subject: [Fis] Music, Leyton, Governance (Longish)
<br />
<p><p>Friends-
<br />
<p>Forgive me as I try to integrate more than one FIS thread among those 
<br />
pinging about in my brain.
<br />
<p>I greatly appreciate that the topic has shifted to music. It seems 
<br />
different enough that we may actually get some fresh perspectives, 
<br />
especially with the entry of the new-to-FIS views of Michael Leyton.
<br />
<p>First a disclaimer: I know Leyton's work and so admire it am 
<br />
incorporating it into an agenda of my own somewhat alien to 
<br />
Michael's. And as I have said on this list, those three foci: 
<br />
Leyton's own imperative, my application need and the focus of the FIS 
<br />
group may be useful complements but it would be a mistake (for me) to 
<br />
conflate or confuse them.
<br />
<p>As I understand the FIS agenda, it takes a fresh look at the nature 
<br />
of the &quot;message&quot; in certain phenomenon and looks for new laws that 
<br />
pertain to that &quot;information&quot; rather than the behavior usually 
<br />
associated with it. In many cases, this will involve redefining or 
<br />
even creating a new notion of that message: for instance in the 
<br />
&quot;dialog&quot; among molecules.
<br />
<p>Juan's approach to music starts with the phenomenon of the carrier, 
<br />
an approach one would expect of a physicist. I, of course, agree with 
<br />
most everything he says. Michael does the opposite: starting with how 
<br />
the receiver is affected by and incorporates the message, developing 
<br />
a notion of information in the context of history/memory/situation 
<br />
and then projecting backwards into the nature of the message. This 
<br />
also is understandable as from a cognitive scientist. As I say, I 
<br />
find this latter approach extremely useful because (my speculation 
<br />
here:) it fits ANY kind of message, allows a concise ALGEBRA over 
<br />
history and information, and as I will conclude below can describe 
<br />
memory of systems as well as individuals.
<br />
<p>But Michael's success comes at the cost of the FIS agenda. He can 
<br />
impute the token of information as an element of the history and stop 
<br />
there. FISers can make something of that imputation and define 
<br />
information tokens in the &quot;pure&quot; as Stonier and Conrad would have it, 
<br />
or look at the grammar of that information as Matsuno and Marijuan 
<br />
do. I'm up for that: enthused about it. But I have to keep in mind 
<br />
that it may not be in Michael's program to do so, because everything 
<br />
in his argument depends on the situating of the tokens.
<br />
<p>But yet, let's try. And here I wish to bring in another thread: the 
<br />
structure of science and government.
<br />
<p>(Note to Michael: the FIS list often goes off on tangents from the 
<br />
programmed topic, usually productively. As the scope of 
<br />
self-organization investigated by FIS spans from molecules to 
<br />
societies, many messages comment on how an advance in theory would 
<br />
lead to &quot;engineering&quot; - forgive the word - techniques that would make 
<br />
human society better. The more outrageous of these are calls to arms 
<br />
to combat international conspiracies to murder children with 
<br />
radioactive poison. But behind that noise is an honest attempt to 
<br />
understand the dynamics at societal - and by this posters usually 
<br />
mean political - levels.)
<br />
<p>Political systems to my mind is a matter of defining behavior and 
<br />
mechanisms in three areas. At the &quot;top&quot; level are things that are a 
<br />
matter of natural law, or appear to be so for all practical 
<br />
consideration. Below that is a domain of the &quot;social compact,&quot; 
<br />
conventions that evolve in societies as a community bargain where 
<br />
each member pays a cost and receives a valuable benefit. The third 
<br />
tier are simpler matters of automatic negotiation, where laws of 
<br />
economics make it desirable to collaborate outside the social compact.
<br />
<p>An example of the first, at least in the US, is the notion that all 
<br />
men should carry the same weight as agents in the system. Though this 
<br />
is a modern idea that was clearly invented, it is treated by 
<br />
Americans as though the &quot;creator&quot; made things this way. An example of 
<br />
the second is proscription against theft; &quot;ownership&quot; of property is 
<br />
a purely artificial concept and respect for it is an evolved matter 
<br />
of the social compact. The third tier can be exemplified by a postal 
<br />
service. Conservatives in the US are adamant that no one has a 
<br />
&quot;right&quot; to postal service, and further that it is not something a 
<br />
government SHOULD do. But they allow it because it makes economic 
<br />
sense for the government to do it and serve everyone.
<br />
<p>People with different philosophies will put different things in 
<br />
different bins, for instance in the US there is great debate over 
<br />
&quot;rights&quot; and priorities of rights, and therefore which of the rights 
<br />
is more natural and therefore basic.
<br />
<p>(Here, I digress to noet an outstanding FIS controversy about whether 
<br />
&quot;logic&quot; is in the second or first category. Some adamantly hold that 
<br />
the universe itself is logical in its fundamental nature, and others 
<br />
- including myself - that logic is an evolved artifact of the social 
<br />
compact in the evolution of science. But never mind.)
<br />
<p>What goes in what bin is less interesting than the evolutionary 
<br />
mechanics at each level. Clearly they are different: the economic one 
<br />
being easily engineered by changing metrics (the vocabulary of 
<br />
discourse).
<br />
<p>Science has the same three tiers and they work in the same way. Since 
<br />
FIS is both WITHIN science and ABOUT the structure of science, we 
<br />
have to consider these dynamics - or whatever structure one uses 
<br />
instead. So there is in my mind a complete congruence between FIS 
<br />
examination of the evolution of science (with the science of 
<br />
evolution) and the evolution of government political systems.
<br />
<p>I suppose that the stuff of the top level is determined by our 
<br />
hardwiring. We know a lot about messages in logical content with 
<br />
respect to that hardwiring. We know much less about messages in 
<br />
musical content and what &quot;language instinct&quot; comes into play. With 
<br />
music, I suppose more is on the &quot;natural&quot; side and with logic, more 
<br />
on the &quot;social compact&quot; side.
<br />
<p>Whew - all that is by way of making a first stab at Juan's challenges 
<br />
in the context of ongoing FIS dialog:
<br />
<p>WHAT IS MUSIC?
<br />
WHY IS THERE MUSIC?
<br />
COULD THERE BE MUSIC ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE?
<br />
<p>I suggest the grammar of music has as little to do with acoustics as 
<br />
the meaning of written sentences has to do with the shapes of 
<br />
letters. In the FIS context, &quot;music&quot; can be characterized as having 
<br />
illogical content that relates in an orderly way in the receiving 
<br />
mind. Therefore the mechanics of music in humans is more &quot;natural,&quot; 
<br />
and more apt to inform us about the types of communications among 
<br />
molecules, even though that statement carries Theosophical overtones.
<br />
<p>&quot;Music&quot; of this type exists because self-organizing systems do. The 
<br />
most fundamental operation in any cognitive apparatus (human to 
<br />
molecular) is symmetry-based, which is why Leyton finds group theory 
<br />
natural to describe the aggregative organizing effect of information. 
<br />
Fiber groups lend themselves well to his interest (memory and 
<br />
situation) and my FIS interest (derived abstractions). There are 
<br />
bundles that are formed internal to agents and those collectively 
<br />
among agents. Where Michael doesn't go but FIS must is in looking at 
<br />
how those abstractions define evolutionary mechanics at &quot;lower&quot; 
<br />
levels of governance. And so, here we are with Jerry Chandler's 
<br />
arguments of the importance of categories and functors across 
<br />
abstractions (as bundles).
<br />
<p>Sorry for the length, Ted
<br />
