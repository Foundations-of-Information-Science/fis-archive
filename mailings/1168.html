<p>
Dear Jerry,
<br />
Dear All,
<br />
<p>Answering to your last posting, I formulated my questions in the 
<br />
introductory text, particularly questions 1-7, because I would like to find 
<br />
some light concerning measurable properties (physical ones, informational 
<br />
ones...) and/or methodologies, in relation with the evaluation of natural 
<br />
resources and the interaction of our society with the environment (how to 
<br />
measure the environmental impact provoked by technological and economic 
<br />
activities?). That understanding could be relevant for sustainable 
<br />
development.
<br />
<p>Ecological economics basically deals with the distribution and management 
<br />
of limited natural resources in order to reach a real sustainable 
<br />
development, in which human beings and their social, technological and 
<br />
economical development would be fully integrated with nature creating a 
<br />
real constructive symbiosis. In my opinion, at the present FIS discussion 
<br />
entitled &quot;Economical Ecologics and Information&quot;, we are looking for the 
<br />
&quot;Scientific Fundamentals of Sustainability&quot;, which is really a huge and 
<br />
major task with quite many different branches and addresses of discussion.
<br />
<p>&nbsp;From the different postings received during this week I consider that 
<br />
there are at least three different branches of discussion already open.  I 
<br />
suggest that we deal with the three of them in depth (and perhaps separately):
<br />
<p>1) Evaluation of natural resources (Pavel, in his very interesting 
<br />
comments, has already advanced some thoughts about that).
<br />
<p>2) Evaluation or measurement of &quot;ecosystems health&quot; or in other words, 
<br />
measurement of the environmental impact provoked by the activities of human 
<br />
beings. This is related with the  previous issue, and both Jerry's opening 
<br />
text and Pavel's posting have inspiring directions about the problem of 
<br />
carrying capacity of Earth (e.g. Ascendancy). In my viewpoint the carrying 
<br />
capacity of ecosystems does not only relate with the depletion of natural 
<br />
resources but also with the quality or health of ecosystems, 'polution' for 
<br />
instance.
<br />
<p>3) Formal characterization of markets. This a very wide and deep topic 
<br />
suggested by Pedro, which is also present in several postings (Karl, Pavel, 
<br />
Loet). It is likely to be one of the key points of the present FIS 
<br />
discussion: the really dense relationship between natural 
<br />
resources/ecosystems, value, price and information.
<br />
<p>I hope this modest synthesis/suggestion could help us to focus our further 
<br />
discussion efforts, and avoid the peril of becoming lost in this vast and 
<br />
ambitious session. By the beginning of next week I will try to prepare some 
<br />
further comments related with the first issue --Evaluation of Natural 
<br />
Resources--which is the aspect closest to my own specialized thermoeconomic 
<br />
field.
<br />
<p>In the interim let me kindly invite to the experts on these three fields, 
<br />
recently subscribed in the FIS list, to share their viewpoints with all of us.
<br />
<p>Have a nice weekend,
<br />
<p>Luis
<br />
