<p>
If we try bearing in mind artificial intelligence, to create an algorithm of
<br />
<p>Ethics a couple of interesting thoughts show up. First (1) is that any 
<br />
Ethics/morals seemingly can be programmed as a set of if-then rules of 
<br />
Action and feedback. Implementing this set does not require any scientific 
<br />
Base, so for this task we would feel quite comfortable with ethics as an art
<br />
<p>However what one notices these rules will never be complete and there will 
<br />
Always be situations when they fail and new rules are needed. Now if we 
<br />
Direct our sight from machines to humans, we can see these same rules in 
<br />
Action and their failure nearly every day. Systems of laws that people have 
<br />
Created to sustain various societies and nations are exactly such type of 
<br />
Rules. Inefficiency of this approach is &quot;on the eye&quot; looking at bulky 
<br />
Judicial systems and mechanisms created to enforce the laws. The situation 
<br />
Is becoming even more controversial as the system created to ensure ethical 
<br />
Behavior and morality of members of societies becomes more and more a 
<br />
Money-making machine for manipulating and overcoming these same laws. 
<br />
Ironically (3000 years passed by and not really much has changed since ;-) )
<br />
<p>This has been described already in 600 BC: 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When the Way is forgotten 
<br />
Duty and justice appear; 
<br />
Then knowledge and wisdom are born 
<br />
Along with hypocrisy. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When harmonious relationships dissolve 
<br />
Then respect and devotion arise; 
<br />
When a nation falls to chaos 
<br />
Then loyalty and patriotism are born. 
<br />
-Lao Tze (TaoDeJing). 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In our part of the World similar arguments were used by Plato in his 
<br />
Republic&quot; discussing the necessity of formal system of ethical rules 
<br />
Enforced as laws. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Nevertheless there exists an algorithm as a single rule (2) which however 
<br />
Can not be implemented in AI (yet) as it is based on self-reference 
<br />
(recursion) of consciousness by reflecting himself to the external world. As
<br />
<p>Machines (AI) do not yet posses conscious notion of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;I feel&quot;, the 
<br />
Algorithm works in real living beings only ;-). The rule is really well 
<br />
Known: (do not) treat others like you want (not) yourself to be treated. 
<br />
This was and still is the base of the Christianity and the Western 
<br />
Civilization (before it become a political system with many new rules to be 
<br />
Obeyed and broken...) as well as of a few great thought systems, before they
<br />
<p>Became systems of rules and rituals, in the world. For example Lao Tze put 
<br />
It this way: 
<br />
The sage does not distinguish between himself and the world; 
<br />
The needs of other people are as his own. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
He is good to those who are good; 
<br />
He is also good to those who are not good, 
<br />
Thereby he is good. 
<br />
He trusts those who are trustworthy; 
<br />
He also trusts those who are not trustworthy, 
<br />
Thereby he is trustworthy. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The sage lives in harmony with the world, 
<br />
And his mind is the world's mind. 
<br />
So he nurtures the worlds of others 
<br />
As a mother does her children. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So indeed as the science is still not able to explain what the consciousness
<br />
<p>Is, how it functions and demonstrate it in an experiment (which might be 
<br />
Very unethical...), it is not able to grasp nor explain ethics holistically.
<br />
<p>Thus ethics is quite an independent domain of human knowing/experience. Is 
<br />
It closer to art, or maybe to religion, or anything else ?.. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Best wishes 
<br />
