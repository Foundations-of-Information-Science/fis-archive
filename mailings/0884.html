In reply to Rafael, who wrote: &quot;Heidegger
<br />
was looking for a *common ground* where the
<br />
different views of time (the quantitative and the
<br />
qualitative) may be grounded &quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina: I am not referring to temporal values as quantitative or
<br />
qualitative. Those terms don't capture what I'm trying to say about
<br />
temporality. Time is an actual material component of mass; time is a
<br />
mode of measuring energy-to-matter. It acts as a measurement or code,
<br />
and as such, is a real component of mass. The three basic temporal
<br />
values that I'm talking about are part of the organization of a
<br />
particular mass, and help define what it can and cannot do in its
<br />
interactions with the world.
<br />
<p>Rafael wrote: &quot;In sum,
<br />
what I have learned from Heidegger (and others...) is
<br />
- to *weaken* the quatitative (absolute and/or
<br />
empirical) conception of (clock-) time
<br />
- this means to weaken the *metaphysics of
<br />
presence* (and the conception of time derived
<br />
from (the duration) of *precenceing* as well as
<br />
from the *limits* (or *de-finition*) of what is
<br />
present (which is Plato's intention: the permanent
<br />
limits of *ideas* make possible their *permanent*
<br />
duration in/outside time)&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina: No. I think you are still thinking in that Kantian/Newtonian
<br />
'absolute ruler' aspect of time that both John and I have commented
<br />
against. I am not saying that the absolute ruler should be weakened;
<br />
I'm saying that it doesn't exist. I'm not sure what you mean by the
<br />
other terms 'metaphysics of presence' but I'm certainly against the
<br />
Platonic Forms - for their temporality is akin to the absolute scale
<br />
of the Newtonian Ruler.

<p>Rafael wrote:  to be able to see why and how our rich forms of
<br />
being-in-time are not just based on the (empirical
<br />
or transcendental) structure of my brain/subjectivity but that
<br />
they depend on the awareness of our natality and
<br />
mortality (including different ways *looking away*
<br />
<p>Edwina: I'm afraid that I don't see your point. What does our
<br />
'awareness of our natality and mortality' have to do with the temporal
<br />
content (understanding time as a material measurement) of an organism,
<br />
i.e., of a tree?
<br />
<p>Rafael wrote: &quot;What follows from this with regard to information?
<br />
Well for instance that information is for us
<br />
*for a while* as we are  *for a while*,
<br />
*ephemere* as Pindar says, which means not
<br />
just *sub-ject* to time but also free to respond to
<br />
time... (and *in time*) at list for a while!&quot;
<br />
<p>Edwina:  This is, to me, a relativist and subjectivist position, and
<br />
I'll have to disagree. I don't think that information is simply
<br />
'what's in my mind'. Reality exists 'out there', as informed matter,
<br />
despite my existence. My view is that energy is transformed to matter,
<br />
within spatial and temporal codes. As such, it is 'informed matter',
<br />
i.e., information. This essentially means that that mass is existent,
<br />
within measured relations (spatial and temporal0 to other mass. It can
<br />
'do things'; it is 'informed'. It is information. This has nothing to
<br />
do with humans or observation or conceptual ideas.
