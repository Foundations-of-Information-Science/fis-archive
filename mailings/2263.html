Dear FISers:
<br />
<p>First, a brief review of previous posts.
<br />
<p>Molecular bionetworks are composed from the chemical elements into  
<br />
informed / organized associations.  Such networks are not composed de  
<br />
novo from individual elements, rather each bionetwork is a further  
<br />
step in the emergence of the history of the species, the history of  
<br />
the individual, the emergence of time itself.  Concepts of scale, of  
<br />
matter, of mathematics and of philosophy are entangled in  
<br />
descriptions of biological behavior of metabolic networks.
<br />
<p>In the opening remarks, I wrote:
<br />
<p>Historically, the investigation of empirical basis of molecular  
<br />
bionetworks (metabolism) started shortly after Pastuer’s pioneering  
<br />
experiments on the causes of fermentation (1870’s).  At that time,  
<br />
the fermentation of grape juice was difficult to control but of great  
<br />
economic importance.  (Bad wine sells cheaply!)  Quantitative  
<br />
analysis of yeast fermentations showed that each molecule of glucose  
<br />
generated two molecules of the 2-carbon alcohol and two molecules of  
<br />
carbon dioxide.  The yeast cell informed the specific destruction of  
<br />
the sugar.  (If the 6-carbon sugar was merely burned, then it  
<br />
produced exactly six molecules of carbon dioxide.)  Thus, the  
<br />
thermodynamic question of why the yeast cell did not completely burn  
<br />
up the 6- carbon sugar entirely into carbon dioxide arose.
<br />
<p>3. From an informational perspective, what does this incomplete  
<br />
fermentation process of glucose suggest about the role of  
<br />
thermodynamics in living processes?
<br />
<p>In the post of Nov 28, 2005, a list of bionetworks was suggested:
<br />
<p>When we speak of bionetworks we wish to include the following classes  
<br />
of networks, starting from simple and growing increasingly perplex:
<br />
1. the networks of chemical communications of simple cells that  
<br />
generate cellular functions and reproduction
<br />
2. the networks of chemical communications among the cells of a  
<br />
multicellular organism
<br />
3. the networks of electrical communication in organisms with central  
<br />
nervous systems
<br />
4. the networks of internal mental communication in higher organisms  
<br />
such that consciousness is generated.
<br />
5. the networks of external communications among members of social  
<br />
and cultural communities.
<br />
6. the networks of eco-system &quot;communications&quot; that sustain the  
<br />
dynamics of ecosystems as organizations of species and geological  
<br />
circumstances.
<br />
(This categorization of bionetworks is somewhat arbitrary but is  
<br />
adequate for this general discussion.  The important point, with one  
<br />
exception, is that the concept of bionetworks is given clarity and  
<br />
distinctiveness by separation of Aristotelian categories. )
<br />
<p>In this post, the concept of number in the context of bionetwork  
<br />
theory will be discussed in light of comments from Stan, Pedro, Bob  
<br />
and others.
<br />
<p>The thoughtful reader will recall that Ted G. stimulated parts of  
<br />
discussion with a list of his questions about the challenges facing a  
<br />
new theory of information.  The present commentary looks at these  
<br />
issues from an historical perspective of number.
<br />
<p>First, one notes that the concept of number is integral to what  
<br />
Wittgenstein referred to as &quot;ordinary everyday language.&quot;  The  
<br />
mathematical edifices constructed over the centuries within the  
<br />
mathematical community are closely related to specialized  
<br />
definitions.  Such specialized definitions serve to force a  
<br />
particular choice of logical relations on the mind.  The choices of  
<br />
such definitions are, of course, informed choices, informational  
<br />
choices.  The choices are guided by consistency with other  
<br />
definitions AND with consistency with calculations.  The number of  
<br />
such mathematical definitions is very large, certainly in the  
<br />
thousands and more probably in the tens of thousands.  One notes that  
<br />
each mathematical definition is a particular choice from among many  
<br />
choices.  Thus, one can imagine, roughly speaking, the calculation of  
<br />
the information content of mathematical language with reference to  
<br />
Wittgenstein's &quot;&quot;ordinary everyday language&quot;  as the reference.  For  
<br />
example, if the mathematical term, point, was one of exactly 16  
<br />
different definitions of the word &quot;point&quot; in everyday language, then  
<br />
four bits of information would be contained in the mathematical term  
<br />
&quot;point&quot;.  (Of course, this is a vast over-simplification of the  
<br />
informational theory of language.  For example, the Mac dictionary  
<br />
gives 18 separate definitions of point as a noun and 6 separate  
<br />
definitions as either a transitive or intransitive verb.  Of the 18  
<br />
denominations of the term &quot;point&quot;, about one-fourth have mathematical  
<br />
connotations.)  From a mathematical perspective, any such calculation  
<br />
of the information content of a mathematical term, would be an object  
<br />
of scorn or ridicule.  The counter argument is simple.  Mathematics  
<br />
depends on using language in a coherent way such that the principles  
<br />
for making generic calculations can be made.  The number of possible  
<br />
ordinary language definitions of a mathematical term contribute  
<br />
little if anything to the objective of making calculations!
<br />
<p>In terms of third order cybernetics, the concept of a number as a  
<br />
point on a line is a quantity, is a position and is a possession of  
<br />
the line.   Thus, a number as a point of reference on the real number  
<br />
line, is, in the sense of Aristotelian categories, a member of three  
<br />
denominations of categories.
<br />
<p>What conclusion can be drawn from the preceding two paragraphs?
<br />
I invite the readers to open these paragraphs in differernt domains  
<br />
of discourse.
<br />
<p>The paragraphs are written for the purpose of exposing the fact that  
<br />
the usage of number as atomic number is different from any of the  
<br />
above connotations.  Atomic numbers are used to construct molecular  
<br />
words as a collection of objects attached to one another.  In other  
<br />
words, the conceptual framework from which bionetworks are  
<br />
constructed is a conceptual framework that uses the concept of number  
<br />
in a way that differs from usage of number in number theory, in  
<br />
geometry, and in Shannon information theory.
<br />
<p>This introduces a dilemma.  Atomic numbers are used as exact numbers  
<br />
with respect to the list of pure forms of matter (such as gold, lead,  
<br />
silver, copper, carbon, ....) and as logical objects; as abstract  
<br />
logical objects with particular logical properties.  In order to  
<br />
distinguish between the two usages, the two definitions, I will use  
<br />
the term, proto-numbers when I am thinking about the logical  
<br />
objects.  The particular logical properties I refer to are the  
<br />
specific attachments of electrical particles to one another to  
<br />
generate stable collations of particles.   Continuing the  
<br />
composition,  stable collations of particles can form generative  
<br />
bionetworks. The inferential logic of such collections is not the  
<br />
logic of Frege, of Russell, of Quine, of Kripke or of McGinn.  So, I  
<br />
will use the term &quot;proto numbers&quot; to refer the logical relations that  
<br />
generate the &quot;ordinary everyday language&quot; of biology and medicine.   
<br />
As an aside, I note that the discovery of &quot;proto numbers&quot; at the turn  
<br />
of the 20th Century led to the development of quantum mechanics and  
<br />
subatomic physics. The term &quot;proto&quot; is used in the sense that proto  
<br />
numbers are the historical precursors of the integers.  The logic of  
<br />
proto numbers bears resemblance to the early Greek concept of   
<br />
&quot;polygonal numbers.&quot;
<br />
<p>With these introductory remarks, I turn to older material.
<br />
<p>First, the issue of optical isomers, fermentation of glucose, and  
<br />
thermodynamics as mentioned in the third question.  Thermodynamics,  
<br />
as a part of the traditional engineering sciences, was derived from  
<br />
natural language by twisting he definitions of natural language into  
<br />
mathematical forms that correspond with real numbers.  The theory is  
<br />
thermodynamics includes variables for volume, temperature, pressure,  
<br />
energy forms, number and a non-variable term, the gas constant.   
<br />
Proto numbers as such do not enter into the small set of  
<br />
thermodynamic equations.  From an Aristotelian perspective, the genus  
<br />
of thermodynamic systems excludes living systems.  (And ecosystems!)   
<br />
The spectacular success of thermodynamic sciences resides in the  
<br />
description of various heat engines where the critical variables are  
<br />
changes in volume, in pressure and and temperature.  In the  
<br />
application of thermodynamics to real systems, all particles must  
<br />
enter in as &quot;number&quot;.  The logical properties of proto numbers enters  
<br />
into thermodynamic equations via the notion of equilibrium constants  
<br />
as pure numbers, not as collations of electrical particles.
<br />
<p>So, returning to the fermentation of wine, the narrative of &quot;why&quot;  
<br />
glucose in not fermented completely to CO2 (carbon dioxide)? I  
<br />
suggest that it is primary a mis-understanding about the languages of  
<br />
systems.  The language of the question is constructed from two  
<br />
different number systems, one describing glucose in terms of proto  
<br />
numbers, the other describing the quasi - equilibrium under the local  
<br />
circumstances in the fermentation vat, in thermodynamic terms.  When  
<br />
we consume the wine, our bodies complete the &quot;fermentation&quot; of  
<br />
glucose to carbon dioxide, with possible pleasant effects.   I am  
<br />
personally very thankful for the proto numbers; if only real numbers  
<br />
existed, we could have wine fermentation!  :-)   The optical isomers,  
<br />
are, of course, an exclusive property of informed proto numbers and  
<br />
are not expressed in thermodynamic language.
<br />
<p>I now turn to Stan's Post of Nov. 30. (Vol. 488, #1.)
<br />
<p>Stan - the focus on Pattee's arguments about initial conditions in  
<br />
not particularly meaningful for bionetwork theory.  (If you have  
<br />
counter-examples to this statement, I would be pleased to hear them.)  
<br />
What does it mean to initialize a bionetwork?  Is any other  
<br />
initialization outside of evolution possible?  (Sporulation is a  
<br />
special case that requires a special discussion.)   Such expressions  
<br />
as &quot;constructed initial and boundary conditions&quot;, which are based in  
<br />
real numbers and thermodynamics, do not describe the conditions  
<br />
internal to a cell.  Such properties are intrinsic to the concept of  
<br />
a bionetwork for a living system.  In particular, Stan, given that  
<br />
the logic of proto numbers is fundamentally different from the logic  
<br />
of the real numbers, I do not see how these concepts aare relevant   
<br />
to bionetworks. Perhaps you have some ideas on how you might  
<br />
transform this hypothetical bio-logic into the logic of the proto  
<br />
numbers?
<br />
<p>SSwrites:
<br />
philosophically MATTER is delayed energy, stickiness
<br />
and delay, obstruction to the flow of energy.
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
I think you are reversing the concepts of source and consequence.
<br />
Only because of the concreteness of matter do we have some  
<br />
understanding of energy as a mathematical abstraction.
<br />
In particular, the proto numbers of the individual species of matter  
<br />
are the sources of our concept of real numbers in the sense of self -  
<br />
reference. The concept of energy is a generic concept, not a concept  
<br />
of species, a continuous variable, not a discrete variable.
<br />
Bionetworks are composed of particular molecular species,  
<br />
mathematical graphs so that one must find a logical path from such a  
<br />
view of matter to a particular species.
<br />
<p>SS:
<br />
In contrast, NUMBER
<br />
concerns the size of distinct collections of matter -- most primitively,
<br />
just: one, some, many.
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
By starting with the abstraction of size, you miss the point.
<br />
Proto numbers stand in exact correspondence with the integers of  
<br />
everyday ordinary language.
<br />
<p>SS:
<br />
Finally, IDENTITY is based in the uniqueness of
<br />
configurations of matter.
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
In the first part of your answer, you deploy real numbers to invoke  
<br />
energy as a source.
<br />
In the comment on identity, you invoke the proto number concept of  
<br />
identity as a species.
<br />
(In the real numbers, identity is associated with the operations of  
<br />
addition and multiplication.)
<br />
<p><p>SS:
<br />
But suppose we were to take seriously a switch from integers to real
<br />
numbers in describing elements.  Ae you willing to assert that an  
<br />
element
<br />
would show itself as, e,g.,13.00000000000...000...infinity?
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
As noted above, the proto numbers are precursors of real numbers.
<br />
As such, they correspond exactly with the natural language integers,  
<br />
1,2,3,... N, where N is a 'small' number, the list of chemical  
<br />
elements is finite..
<br />
Proto numbers are monomials.
<br />
When you write, 13.00000000000...000...infinity?, you presuppose that  
<br />
the proto numbers are polynomials and that the concept of extension  
<br />
as used in the real numbers applies to proto numbers.  Both  
<br />
presuppositions fail in proto numbers.
<br />
<p>SS:
<br />
Even if you
<br />
would opt for that, where IS any individual of this element at this  
<br />
moment?
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
Again, you invoke a property of real numbers and the physical  
<br />
tradition when you ask about where IS an element at this moment.
<br />
For bionetworks, the self-referential property of the proto number  
<br />
system renders such language as artificial.
<br />
The self-referential character of  proto numbers / DNA / bionetworks  
<br />
is sufficient to conduct biological function.
<br />
If you wish to invoke the concept of a common spatial axis for  
<br />
locating matter, then the location will be expressed in terms of real  
<br />
numbers (using such concepts as center of gravity and linear vector  
<br />
spaces), not proto numbers and illations based on informed  
<br />
relationships.
<br />
<p>Stan:  It seems to me that you ought to try your hand at explaining  
<br />
the optical isomer problem and the wine fermentation problem in terms  
<br />
of your entropic digestion of nature.
<br />
<p>Turning to Pedro's post of December 2 (vol. 446, #2), Pedro writes:
<br />
<p>PM:
<br />
and a dismissal of the importance of quantum mechanics, contemplated  
<br />
as &quot;merely describing the motions of electrical particles in space  
<br />
and time.&quot;
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
The phrase &quot;a dismissal of the importance of quantum mechanics&quot; is  
<br />
your phrase, not mine.
<br />
I only sought to place the role of quantum mechanics (QM) in  
<br />
perspective relative to the theory of bionetworks.  QM is an  
<br />
extremely important theory for relating physical concepts of motion  
<br />
in space.  The fact that is restricted to a simple conceptualization  
<br />
of time severely restricts its utility for biological purposes, such  
<br />
as the reproduction of bionetworks.
<br />
<p>The proto numbers are the source of quantum mechanics.  It is the   
<br />
concepts of number and electrical particle that the concepts of force  
<br />
and motion are applied to.  After all, what are the variables of the  
<br />
Schodinger equation for molecules?
<br />
<p>Before quantum mechanics can be a description of bionetworks, one must:
<br />
First, identify all (the thousands, the tens of thousands, more,  
<br />
depending on the biological species) the members of the bionetwork.
<br />
Secondly, one must identify exactly which proto numbers are present  
<br />
in each identity.
<br />
Thirdly, one must identify exactly the ratio of the proto numbers  
<br />
with respect to one another in each identity.
<br />
Fourthly, one must compose the proto numbers into a unique pattern of  
<br />
relations such that the abstract identity of the pattern is in  
<br />
correspondence with properties of the identity.
<br />
<p>After these four steps are completed, one can then apply the concepts  
<br />
of motion in space and temporal changes in local position to the  
<br />
pattern of proto numbers, that is, attempt to write a version of a  
<br />
Schodinger - like equation for each member and for the system
<br />
as a whole.
<br />
In other words, it is necessary to make calculations with proto  
<br />
numbers before calculations with real numbers in quantum mechanical  
<br />
relations can be considered.
<br />
<p>Quantum mechanics is a well grounded physical theory that was  
<br />
constructed for the explicit purpose of calculating the motion of  
<br />
electrical particles in space and with time.  If we do not keep this  
<br />
fact in perspective, we lose our perspective of the interplay among  
<br />
philosophies of concept, number, size, theory and fact.  Stan's  
<br />
narrative is a crisp example of the knotty interplay among language,  
<br />
number and philosophy.  From a practical perspective, the  
<br />
Aristotelian categories (with a concept of matter substituted for the  
<br />
concept of substance) provide a useful framework for separating the  
<br />
wheat from the chaff.
<br />
<p>PM continues in the post of Dec 8, 2005, (vol. 488, #3)
<br />
<p>In my view, what changed dramatically was not only the relationship  
<br />
with numbers but, above all, the way to &quot;validate&quot; knowledge: from  
<br />
&quot;disputatio&quot; to &quot;experimentatio&quot; (rhetorics becoming subsidiary to  
<br />
experimental procedures--the big point of the scientific revolution).  
<br />
This point is not trivial concerning our nascent field, as quite many  
<br />
parties disregard any empirical grounding (abandoning the quest for  
<br />
&quot;facts&quot; to ingrain their theoretical-doctrinary views). Given that,  
<br />
potentially, fis also implies a new vision on info and knowledge, and  
<br />
the contemporary role of sciences at the social realm, this may lead  
<br />
to fine-tune our views on what thought-collectives actually do... in  
<br />
any case, the &quot;mystification of numbers&quot; looks a very good point for  
<br />
future discussions.
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
I concur with your over-all view.
<br />
The notion of the &quot;mystification of numbers&quot; is a much deeper notion  
<br />
that expresses sentiments about the philosophy of mathematics in  
<br />
relation to the proto numbers.
<br />
<p>The logic of the proto numbers is a simple logic using integers and  
<br />
ratios of integers. This logic differs from the usual abstraction in  
<br />
that it is grounded in the chemical elements, in calculations that  
<br />
are extendable to molecules of unbounded size, not the abstractions  
<br />
related to continuity.
<br />
<p>With the works of Galileo, Descarte, and Newton, mathematics started  
<br />
down a road to the detailed analysis of continuity.  Beginning with  
<br />
G. Cantor, the importance of calculation began to be minimized.  In  
<br />
pure mathematics today, the concepts of abstraction, of abstraction  
<br />
of abstractions, of abstraction of abstractions of  
<br />
abstractions, ...   continue on indefinitely, whether calculations  
<br />
are possible or not.  Bionetworks theory is based on exact chemical  
<br />
calculations.  it is the introduction of continuity into such a  
<br />
system that is difficult.
<br />
<p>In a certain sense, pure mathematics has returned to the philosophy  
<br />
of validation via &quot;disputatio&quot;; of course, applied mathematics must  
<br />
remain in contact with the reality of validation by  
<br />
&quot;experimentatio.&quot;   For example, take Conway's construction of  
<br />
&quot;surreal&quot; numbers.  Are surreal numbers really numbers?
<br />
<p>The methods of commutative proof within the proto number system is  
<br />
based on validation by &quot;experimentatio.&quot;
<br />
<p>(In order to attempt to avoid being misunderstood, I feel obligated  
<br />
to add to that I enjoy pure mathematics immensely and have been  
<br />
blessed with the opportunity to study it intensely for several  
<br />
years.  It is my belief that modern mathematics is created within  
<br />
natural language within our minds.  If we wish use the wonderful  
<br />
logical insights and delightful coherences among modern mathematic  
<br />
structures, such as category theory, we must seek the correspondence  
<br />
relations and document the commutative diagrams with facts.)
<br />
<p>PM:
<br />
Thus, to continue with Jerry's taxonomy, the problem is that the self- 
<br />
production network is a mere label for an enormous landscape of  
<br />
molecular interactions and processes of quite a heterogeneous nature.  
<br />
Let me take home the term &quot;molecular landscape&quot;.
<br />
<p><p>JLRC:
<br />
I concur.  The heterogeneous nature is essential. At present, we have  
<br />
no way to express precisely what we wish to include under the concept  
<br />
of &quot;heterogeneous nature.&quot;
<br />
I have carefully avoided, in so far as possible, the topics of time,  
<br />
of dynamics, of reproduction.
<br />
A bionetwork has been, generally speaking, discussed as a static  
<br />
structure.
<br />
The inadequacy of this approach is readily apparent.
<br />
<p>But, I would also note that this is exactly what Shannon does when he  
<br />
invokes the concept of encoding a message.  An encoded message is a  
<br />
static object.  To introduce a change in an encoded message is to  
<br />
introduce an error into the message.
<br />
<p>The critical distinction, from a conceptual veiw point, is that the  
<br />
bionetwork messages contain the source of motion for organism.  A  
<br />
network of Shannon messages is completely inert.  No necessary  
<br />
relation is essential among Shannon messages.  By contrast, the  
<br />
collations of proto numbers composed into bionetwork messages include  
<br />
the messages necessary for reproduction, contingent on the necessary  
<br />
environment.
<br />
<p>PM continues (vol 488, #5)  in a quote from Paul Davies:
<br />
<p>&quot;Quantum Mechanics thus provides an automatic discretization of  
<br />
genetic information [without the need for complex intermediate  
<br />
chemistry]... but how complexity emerges in quantum systems is a  
<br />
subject still in its infancy...&quot;
<br />
<p>This is an intriguing quote.  Is it more than an effort seeking to  
<br />
finesse a deep and intractable mathematical dilemma?  As Koichiro has  
<br />
pointed out, along with many others, physicist have a deep problem in  
<br />
coping with the existence of the integers, exact numbers.  However,  
<br />
the units of measurement of a quanta are ergs - seconds.  Thus, how  
<br />
can one have a duration without continuity?  The source of this  
<br />
dilemma, at its roots, is the nature of a geometric line, not a  
<br />
material  dilemma, rather a temporal dilemma, a geometric dilemma.
<br />
<p>Davies imaginative usage of language is absolutely charming.  The  
<br />
question is: Does the structural framework of his logic allows him  
<br />
any other alternative than to claim a biological attribute for a  
<br />
mathematical necessity?  How should the concept of time enter into  
<br />
bionetworks?  As an absolute concept?  As a geometric concept?  As a  
<br />
product relation? As a tensor?  As a contingency with the  
<br />
surroundings of the organism?  Or, is network time more like a  
<br />
Kirchoff's network of electrical flows over a collation of proto  
<br />
numbers?
<br />
<p>(For those interested in a long philosophical discussion of these  
<br />
concepts, Alicia Juarrero's book, Dynamics in Action, Intentional  
<br />
Behavior as a Complex System, MIT Press, (1999) is highly  
<br />
recommended.  For a contrary view, Susan Oyama, Evolution's Eye.)
<br />
<p>Of course, since quantum mechanics itself is based on proto numbers,  
<br />
his entire line of reasoning about genetic discretization is suspect.

<br />
<p>The problem, as I see it, is that science labors under a metaphysic that
<br />
has outlived its usefulness. It is a ragged remnant of what two hundred
<br />
years ago passed for Enlightened science, but most colleagues cling  
<br />
to the
<br />
shreds with a ferocious tenacity!
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
<p>As I look back over the past twenty years of WESS, Bob, I think I see  
<br />
a few signs of progress in the community at large.  But, at the core,  
<br />
the utility of certain ideas for engineering, for warfare, for public  
<br />
persuasion, for economic advantage, continue to carry the public  
<br />
conceptualization of science.
<br />
<p>One deep issue is the issue of how language is used.  If the  
<br />
scientific community does not demand a consistent usage of language,  
<br />
then the intrinsic flexibility of technical sentences can be given  
<br />
multiple interpretations.  It is for this reason that I greatly  
<br />
admire the mathematics community.  Mathematicians, in general, have  
<br />
extremely high standards when it comes logical integrity and  
<br />
consistency.  Chemists hold to a similar standard of proof for  
<br />
chemical structures.   The tensions between rigor and imagination are  
<br />
severe.
<br />
<p>Igor writes (vol. 488, 6)
<br />
<p>A cell mechanism A adapts (measures) to the cell environment, which  
<br />
it is part of. During this adaptation it increases its complexity and  
<br />
changes (by its very presence) the cell environment, which thus also  
<br />
increases its complexity. Given that there are many such mechanisms  
<br />
(enzyme catalyzed chemical reactions, organelles, membranes, etc),  
<br />
each mechanism increases its complexity by reflecting on the presence  
<br />
of the totality of the other mechanisms.
<br />
<p>JLRC:
<br />
Reading your words from a 'big picture' frame of mind, I concur.
<br />
<p>I would prefer to express the concepts in terms of the flow of  
<br />
electrical particles...
<br />
The term &quot;mechanism&quot; can be used in either a mathematical sense, a  
<br />
chemical sense, or a general sense.  In what sense is it being used  
<br />
in this paragraph?
<br />
<p>More specifically, in the narrative you provide, how does one create  
<br />
relations between electrical particles and the dynamics of  
<br />
bionetworks?  Although only a small number of different electrical  
<br />
particles exist, how does one create the range of organisms in an  
<br />
ecosystem?
<br />
<p>How can we make such concepts EXACT such that they become a  
<br />
meaningful method of scientific prediction?  This is the challenge  
<br />
for bionetworks at all levels of perplexity.  How does individuality  
<br />
arise from such a narrative?
<br />
<p>What would be a theory of information or communication such that a  
<br />
generative narrative would be the natural extension of the dynamical  
<br />
system describing the collation of electric particles?
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that I have been able to express the logical issues  
<br />
surrounding bionetworks in a compelling way and introduce the  
<br />
mathematical concept of proto numbers in a digestible manner.  In  
<br />
closing, I note that the conceptualization of proto numbers was  
<br />
discussed in papers presented in Baden-Baden and Liege last summer.
<br />
<p>Well, once again I have been unable to respond to all issues.   
<br />
Hopefully the issue of &quot;causa aequat effectum&quot; for bionetworks can be  
<br />
addressed before we move on to the next topic.
<br />
<p>Happy Holidays to All!
<br />
<p><p>Cheers
