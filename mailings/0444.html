<p>
Ted, Pedro
<br />
<p>Yes, Leyton's work is thought-provoking.
<br />
<p>I'd just like to make a comment from an IS perspective.
<br />
<p>To the extent that information is itself the constituting
<br />
mechanism/experience exploring the symmetry/asymmetry paradigm 
<br />
creates an interesting vista which may account for a wide range of 
<br />
relevant phenomena - from aesthetic necessity to 'asymmetric information'
<br />
in market economies
<br />
(<a href="../../www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/2001/public.html">http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/2001/public.html</a>)
<br />
to ligand/substrate binding and Gestalt theory.
<br />
<p>Bateson's 'difference that makes/finds a difference' becomes 'a shape that
<br />
makes/finds
<br />
its shape' as the quest for a theory of information moves into a classical
<br />
phase.
<br />
<p>But doesn't the informational experience or situation always constitute the 
<br />
relationship between the participants as asymmetric?
<br />
<p>For example, I lend Pedro a book which contains some good information
<br />
(content)
<br />
on the language of cells. He returns the book but that exchange does not
<br />
satisfy my  
<br />
particular informational need. The specific content is contingent.  
<br />
The informational relationship is not symmetrical - it involves
<br />
a unidirectional movement between participants without reciprocity.
<br />
<p>In the same way the enzymatic modification of the substrate by its ligand,
<br />
my genealogic connection to my grandfather or a copy's relationship to an
<br />
original are intrinsically asymmetric. 
<br />
<p>I can return my grandfather's love, his book and possibly his words but not
<br />
'his'
<br />
information. This is reflected in English usage - we never talk about
<br />
'giving back' or 'returning' information only 'receiving it' or 'passing it
<br />
on'.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
By comparison interactive speech acts are symmetric in the sense of &quot;Do you
<br />
want to
<br />
borrow my book, Pedro?&quot; The artefact of knowing (the physical book) and the
<br />
word 'book'
<br />
can constitute a symmetric relationship between the participants. The
<br />
informational content cannot. 
<br />
<p>If Leyton's ideas are to move out of the world of CAD and into the
<br />
conceptual substrata of other domains (as you hope, Ted) the
<br />
symmetry/asymmetry paradigm needs to 'find a shape' which resonates
<br />
across the board.
<br />
<p>For example, the attempt to impose lingusitic symmetry (say Boolean) on 
<br />
asymmetric informational experiences/behaviours is a critical issue within 
<br />
contemporary IS. 
<br />
<p>And it would be nice to discover one day that the folding pattern of RNA
<br />
and the holding shape of the humble paper clip reflected a similar principle
<br />
of functional symmetry...

<br />
<p><p>Pedro--
<br />
<p>Our convergence may be even closer than you indicate below. As my FIS 
<br />
paper probably won't make the deadline, let me briefly comment here.
<br />
<p>My remark on the focus of receiver verses message: Leyton allows the 
<br />
receiver to host the &quot;situating&quot; mechanism. In contrast, I presume 
<br />
that the impetus for situating needs to be in the information itself, 
<br />
using a modified thermodynamics. In other words, though we all focus 
<br />
on the actions of the receiver, we have to impute the primary agency 
<br />
to information. You and I are in agreement on this point I think. 
<br />
Moreover,  the vast majority of FISers seem attracted to the larger 
<br />
notion of functional agency in the information.
<br />
<p>Back to Leyton. He uses a group theoretic &quot;wreath product&quot; to relate 
<br />
control (including the organizational/constitutive impetus) to 
<br />
content. For FIS to adopt Leyton's elegant group operators, we'd need 
<br />
to add self-referential control groups WITHIN the content. That was 
<br />
my point. I think this is a non-trivial problem. We could adopt 
<br />
Michael's general approach but not his specific mechanism without 
<br />
some bother.
<br />
<p>In our work here, we accommodate this problem of 
<br />
control-in-the-message by using speech act theory, a widely employed 
<br />
technique. It presumes the agency to &quot;do work&quot; is in the information 
<br />
itself and has many mature and useful computational tools. But it is 
<br />
a mere trick, devoid of the type of theory FIS attempts.
<br />
<p>Your language of cells work, Matsuno's examination of the grammar of 
<br />
action, John C's implicit perspectives on intrinsic clustering 
<br />
concepts all seem promising to me to fill this need for formal 
<br />
principles. In this, I am acting as a consumer of ideas toward a 
<br />
theory for my synthetic environments not a generator of those ideas. 
<br />
But my perspective is one which has tried (often inexpertly) to dive 
<br />
below the general ideas in search of formal mechanisms that work.
<br />
<p>Leyton actually has a mechanism on which to comment, prompting the 
<br />
type of discussion around which real progress can be made. Rosen, so 
<br />
far as I can see does not, though his ordering of concepts is thought 
<br />
provoking.
<br />
<p>Best, Ted
<br />
<p><p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Ted,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for the exciting posting!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with most of your comments, and I think we are getting close to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;converge on really foundational items of our field. Let me slightly amplify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the minor differences:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your elegant comments on Leyton (a complete surprise--thanks Jim!) induce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me to initially support his position of focusing on the subject, either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emitter or receiver. Actually we are working here (a few fisers in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Zaragoza) on a sort of info theory, not really embodied, but at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempting a bridge on how the info realms in the 'constitutive' and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'communicational' may interrelate. Our stuff is very modest (remember the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;language of cells contribution we presented to the fis 98, based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Javorsky's multidimensional partitions) and we are very excited with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'food for thought' that your posting and similar works that are arriving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the conf. do provide.  Also, let me add that rather than talking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;cognition&quot; of things like cells and elementary particles, I would join
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;John Holgate's and prefer 'informational' (entities), however, I feel quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reluctant to consider as informational the merely physical existentialities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(though, of course, one can always apply to them some Thermo or Sannon info
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measurements). Informational existences start with the living cell onwars.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;John Collier also made an intriguing point on Rosen--then shouldn't we look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for co-defining clusters of info concepts, as Kauffman mentions in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Investigations, curiously relating Wittgenstein and Rosen views?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pedro
