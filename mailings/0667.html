Dear Pedro and FISers 
<br />
<p>Pedro wrote on July the 5th relatively to John's Q6
<br />
(Is this characterization of meaning formalizable,
<br />
and in particular is the notion of the constraint of
<br />
the system formalizable? ):
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I had replied to Cristophe in a previous message I am very intrigued 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with 'the constraint' notion as an interlevel ascending tool (by the way, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perhaps using 'constraints' would be better). They appear to me as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational surrogates to climb, or to descend, the commands from an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adjacent level of complexity description. Usually, our sciences establish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new 'principles' and ad hoc disciplines in order to contemplate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emerging existentialities at higher or lower levels. If so, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'principles' or 'constraints' or 'reglaments' or 'constitutions' matter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quite a lot for our understanding of the emerging info entities... 
</em><br />
<p>It is true that the notion of constraint is not the easiest thing to 
<br />
formalize when we stay in the systemic field. It can have there many 
<br />
understandings, depending on the system.
<br />
So, as Pedro says, it may appear overall as a &quot;computational 
<br />
surrogate to climb or descend the commands from an adjacent level of 
<br />
complexity description&quot;. The problem with these &quot;adjacent levels of 
<br />
complexity&quot; is that they are better understood today as adjacent and 
<br />
ordered than they are in their nature or chaining. We can say that, via 
<br />
evolution, matter came before life, and life came before human. But we 
<br />
do not know how to explain level n+1 from level n. How did matter 
<br />
produce life ? how did life product human ? These question are still 
<br />
looking for answers.
<br />
If answers were available, it would be rather easy to find a common 
<br />
definition for the &quot;constraint&quot; of the Meaning Generator System,
<br />
clearly  applicable to all the different levels of complexity. 
<br />
And we could perhaps think about some generic formalization. But today  
<br />
these different levels of complexity remain distincts. 
<br />
So I feel that we cannot do more than find a loose general definition
<br />
for &quot;constraint&quot;, without being too much demanding on its strict 
<br />
applicability at each level of complexity. Next step being to see 
<br />
how this definition can be tuned for each level and how the constraint 
<br />
can be more precisely defined and formalized at each level. 
<br />
(Pedro, perhaps were you anticipating this point when saying 
<br />
that &quot;using 'constraints' would be better&quot; ?)
<br />
An easy general (and rather loose) definition for &quot;constraint&quot; in the
<br />
systemic background could be: &quot;the  ensemble of automatisms, rules, 
<br />
laws and finalities that the system must respect to satisfy its nature&quot;.
<br />
Application for life is quite easy as the nature of life is rather well 
<br />
understood: the constraints of a living system are to survive and to 
<br />
reproduce (vital constraints). If the living system is not able to 
<br />
survive, it will die and loose its nature of living element. If the 
<br />
living element is not capable of reproducing itself, its nature as a
<br />
species will disappear. 
<br />
Application of the definition to human is more difficult, as we do not
<br />
know the nature of human (and more precisely the nature of mind). So 
<br />
we are not currently in a position to list the constraints of human 
<br />
(that would come in addition to the constraints of life). 
<br />
But this is not a stopper. I feel we just need to investigate more, 
<br />
keeping the same approach. These problems are rather stimulating. 
<br />
One could even say that trying to understand the chaining of different
<br />
levels of complexity through their corresponding constraints could make 
<br />
available some new tools to look at the nature of these levels (this
<br />
introduces the topic of  &quot;evolution of the constraints&quot;). 
<br />
<p>I hope the above has provided some clarification on the usage made of
<br />
the word  'constraint' and about possible formalizations. 
<br />
<p>Regards
<br />
<p>Christophe Menant
