The enlightening work carried out by Lewis Mumford, Anatol Rapoport, 
<br />
Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding and several others may help 
<br />
researchers, experts and scholars, who have recognized the 
<br />
potentiality of Systems Thinking supported when necessary by 
<br />
Cybernetic Interactions, to determine how to cope 'scientifically' - 
<br />
therefore ethically - with the worst crisis ever faced by humankind.
<br />
<p>Consequently I dare to believe that the Systems and Cybernetic 
<br />
Community may encourage today the whole Scientific Community to 
<br />
immediately offer arguments for helping millions of people to change 
<br />
consciously the political climate that has been intelligently 
<br />
structured --but derived from narrow minded, short-sighted and even 
<br />
blind appraisals-- for organizing another World War against humanity.

<br />
<p><p>&quot;... The rise of the machine and the fall of man are two parts of the 
<br />
same process: never before have machines been so perfect, and never 
<br />
before have men sunk so low, for the sub-human conduct that the Nazis 
<br />
have exhibited in the torture and extermination of their victims 
<br />
drops below any level of mere brutality: That degradation is shared 
<br />
by those who passively condone this sub-human conduct, by belittling 
<br />
its horror and denying its terrible significance.&quot;
<br />
<p>Lewis Mumford, The Condition of Man, 1944
<br />
<p><p><p>&quot;... According to a belief widely held among scientists no less than 
<br />
among humanists and men of letters, science does not, should not, and 
<br />
ultimately cannot determine the ends for which it is used. This view, 
<br />
entailing a sharp separation of science and values, Dr. Rapoport 
<br />
regards as a tragic fallacy: the fallacy rests, as he demonstrates, 
<br />
upon an imperfection sight on the part of scientists themselves into 
<br />
the ethical implications of their own scientific behavior&quot; S. I 
<br />
Hayakawa
<br />
<p>&quot;...different men want to go in different directions, and some of 
<br />
these directions are incompatible with the direction inherent in 
<br />
science itself.&quot; Therefore, &quot;the scientist must subscribe to certain 
<br />
values (and discard others) no because he is a 'good citizen' or a 
<br />
product of a [particular] culture or a member of a [particular] 
<br />
church, but because he is a scientist.&quot;
<br />
<p>Anatol Rapoport, Science and the Goals of Man, 1950.
<br />
<p><p><p>&quot;That Reason does not automatically lead to a solution of the human 
<br />
problem and, by and large, has little influence in the sanguinary 
<br />
course of human history,... ...has technological power increased 
<br />
human happiness? Is a scientifically controlled society desirable?&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;The image of man as robot is a projection into science of the 
<br />
Zeitgeist of the period... Man as a machine can be programmed; all 
<br />
those machines equal like automobiles coming from the assembly line 
<br />
equilibrium or comfort as ultimate value; behavior as a business 
<br />
transaction with minimum expense and maximum gain-this is a perfect 
<br />
expression of the philosophy of commercial society...
<br />
In the advertisers' philosophy, there is a &quot;brain box&quot; ... which must 
<br />
be stuffed full with the advertisers's slogans to the exclusion of 
<br />
others; in &quot;pecuniary logic&quot; reality and truth are replaced by 
<br />
wishful thinking and conditioning by advertising art; and, of course, 
<br />
people are manipulated as they deserve, that is, as overgrown Skinner 
<br />
rats.
<br />
<p>&quot;...the effects of modern psycho techniques and behavioral 
<br />
engineering amount to functional decerebralization. Not even the 
<br />
threat of atomic annihilation can change the ways of a manipulated 
<br />
humanity, which are almost as strongly ingrained as the instinctive 
<br />
urge of a herd of lemmings, leading them irresistibly into 
<br />
self-destruction&quot;
<br />
<p>&quot;...in an emerging psychology of man or... a new science of man or 
<br />
general anthropology,... an interdisciplinary enterprise including 
<br />
biology, psychiatry, sociology, linguistics, the economics, the 
<br />
arts,... The key words (for) a new psychology, I propose, are 
<br />
symbolism and system. ...against the robot model of the primary 
<br />
reactivity of the organism a new conception emerges which in 
<br />
psychological language can be termed that of man as an active 
<br />
personality system.&quot;
<br />
<p>Ludwig von Bertalanffy Robots, Men and Minds, 1967
<br />
<p><p><p>&quot;Bertalanffy advocated that we dare to broaden our loyalty from 
<br />
nation to globe: he urged that we become patriots of the planet, 
<br />
endeavoring to think and act primarily as members of humanity. 
<br />
Without necessarily diluting our own individual and cultural 
<br />
identity, he said, we must begin protecting the individual and 
<br />
cultural identity of others. He urged that we begin pledging our 
<br />
allegiance to humanity and to the earth on which we stand, one planet 
<br />
indivisible or no planet at all. ...he advocated a new global 
<br />
morality:&quot; &quot;an ethos which does not center on individual good and 
<br />
individual value alone , but on the adaptation of mankind as a global 
<br />
system, to its new environment&quot; &quot;...we are dealing with emergent 
<br />
realities; no longer with isolated groups of men, but with a 
<br />
systematically interdependent global community. It is this level of 
<br />
[reality] which we must keep before our eyes if we are able to 
<br />
inspire large-scale action designed to assure our collective and 
<br />
hence our individual survival&quot; [Bertalanffy]
<br />
<p>Mark Davidson Uncommon Sense. The Life and Thought of Ludwig von 
<br />
Bertalanffy, 1983
<br />
<p><p><p>&quot;We cannot discuss the state of the world system without recognizing 
<br />
the existence of an activity that is euphemistically called &quot;national 
<br />
defense&quot; but that more honestly we should simply call the &quot;war 
<br />
industry. &quot; ... When we talk about national defense,...we are 
<br />
thinking particularly of war as a social institution and the 
<br />
organizations that specialize in this. On the whole, economics is 
<br />
interested in the production of &quot;goods&quot;; a national defense 
<br />
organization is interested in the production of &quot;bads&quot; - that is 
<br />
negative commodities - ... The threat system is an attempt to 
<br />
organize the exchange of &quot;bads&quot; for  &quot;goods&quot;.
<br />
<p>The world has become a single system for the first time in human 
<br />
history. This began with Columbus, I suppose, but I would say that 
<br />
the world only became a single system in a certain sense in the 
<br />
twentieth century. ... we see this in what I sometimes call the 
<br />
&quot;superculture&quot; - the science based culture of airports, radios, 
<br />
television, automobiles,... Once we have transistor radios we are 
<br />
part of the world society. This actually means that wars of conquest 
<br />
are likely to be unprofitable. ...The technical developments in 
<br />
weaponry and national defense organizations have clearly destroyed 
<br />
the unconditional viability of all states. The great justification of 
<br />
war was that it pushed violence beyond your borders, so that you 
<br />
could preserve peace at home by having war somewhere else. In a way 
<br />
the United States did that in Vietnam, .... in a major war this is 
<br />
not longer feasible, ...the whole concept of defense through war has 
<br />
really collapsed because of the increase in the range and the 
<br />
deadlines of weapons. ... What we have now is deterrence - that is, 
<br />
Mutually Assured Destruction, properly called &quot;MAD&quot;
<br />

<br />
presented at the IIASA) 1983
