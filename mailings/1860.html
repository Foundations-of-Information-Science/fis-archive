                    This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
                    <br />
                    fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I
                    <br />
                    have no intentions of causing you any pains so i
                    <br />
                    decided to contact you through this medium .
                    <br />
                    As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die
                    someday.
                    <br />
                    My name is ABBAS FAROUK, a merchant in Dubai, in the
                    <br />
                    U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and
                    <br />
                    esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late
                    <br />
                    due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has
                    <br />
                    defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have
                    <br />
                    only about a few months to live according to medical experts.
                    <br />
                    I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
                    <br />
                    never really cared for anyone not even myself but
                    <br />
                    my business. Though I am very rich, I was never
                    <br />
                    generous, I was always hostile to people and only
                    <br />
                    focus on my business as that was the only thing I
                    <br />
                    cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
                    <br />
                    that there is more to life than just wanting to
                    <br />
                    have or make all the money in the world. I believe
                    <br />
                    when God gives me a second chance to come to this
                    <br />
                    world I would live my life a different way from
                    <br />
                    how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is
                    <br />
                    near, I have willed and given most of my properties
                    <br />
                    and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and
                    Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one
                    of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations
                    in the U.A.E, London and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my
                    self any more.
                    <br />
                    I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have
                    there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I
                    do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last
                    of my money which is the huge cash deposit that I have with Financial Firm Abroad
