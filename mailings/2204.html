                    Dear Koichiro:
                    <br />
                <p>Thank you for your response on your conceptualization of information
                    <br />
                    from the perspective of theoretical physics. It seems that your
                    <br />
                    views could possibly overlap with Igor in the sense of the physicists
                    <br />
                    view of biological information - &quot;function as fiction&quot;.
                    <br />
                <p>Because the order property of this narrative is important, I re-post
                    <br />
                    the original questions and your response. It is essential to re-re-
                    <br />
                    read these posts in order to understand my further questions, which
                    <br />
                    are appended as the last section.
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Dear Kochiro:
                    <br />
                <p>Your post of September 29, 2005 leaves me in a state of wonder.
                    <br />
                <p>I really do not understand the potential relations between the
                    <br />
                    semantics, which appear to &quot;unconceal&quot; and the syntax, which appears
                    <br />
                    to &quot;re-conceal,&quot; that which was unconcealed. In view of the many
                    <br />
                    issues that appear to be glued together (with lose of identity) in
                    <br />
                    your narrative, I will address only the first parts of your post.
                    <br />
                <p>

                    Folks,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the definitional matter, energy and information are
                    <br />
                    intimately
                    <br />
                    related to each other.
                    <br />
                <p>This is a wonderful sentence. May I assume that the reference is an
                    <br />
                    abstract meta language of types? For example, a bacterium, a fruit
                    <br />
                    fly and an elephant are all of he same type, the commonality being
                    <br />
                    that the names represent living organisms.
                    <br />
                <p>My only concern here will be to call some attention
                    <br />
                    to the issue of information in relation to energy, I would hope.
                    <br />
                <p>This suggests that the issue is not of types but of tokens.
                    <br />
                    Is this issue one of existence? If not of existence, what is the
                    <br />
                    source of the potential non-definitional relation?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy conceived in the first law of thermodynamics on energy
                    <br />
                    transformation is informational in precipitating a new type of energy
                    <br />
                    carrier through cohesive interactions acting among the pre-existing
                    <br />
                    energy
                    <br />
                    carriers.
                    <br />
                <p>May I presume that an energy carrier is an existent energy?
                    <br />
                    (And, note that energy of the first law is of a definition type, or
                    <br />
                    do I misread your intent?)
                    <br />
                    If so, is the existent energy a generic energy?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>Energy transformation is informational in making a new difference.
                    <br />
                <p>Is the &quot;new difference&quot; a non-definable variable?
                    <br />
                <p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A principal energy carrier met with in material processes is a
                    <br />
                    Planck's
                    <br />
                    energy quantum.
                    <br />
                <p>Does the view of an existent energy restrict its manifestation to
                    <br />
                    energy quantum in the &quot;apart from definitional&quot; matter?
                    <br />
                <p>Nonetheless, a Planck's energy quantum does not transform
                    <br />
                    itself within linear quantum mechanics, though it can yield a
                    <br />
                    macroscopic
                    <br />
                    coherence by way of a linear superposition of each microscopic
                    <br />
                    quantum. If
                    <br />
                    the relative time interval for the occurrence of nonlinear quantum
                    <br />
                    coherence
                    <br />
                    is limited, the likely quantum coherence to occur would be at most of a
                    <br />
                    linear type allowing only a linear superposition.
                    <br />
                <p>Why?
                    <br />
                <p>In the absence of definitions, what restricts the domain of
                    <br />
                    interactions?
                    <br />
                <p>In contrast, appearance or
                    <br />
                    emergence of a new quantum of interest may be expected from nonlinear
                    <br />
                    quantum coherence of a lasting type.
                    <br />
                <p>Quantum or quanta?
                    <br />
                    Are &quot;lasting type&quot;s of quantum durable? If so, how does one see the
                    <br />
                    manifestation of the &quot;lasting types?&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>Could you post an experimental description of:
                    <br />
                <p>&quot;The citric acid cycle running in the presence of temperature
                    <br />
                    gradients alone
                    <br />
                    without recourse to enzymes of biological origin is internally
                    <br />
                    coherent only
                    <br />
                    nonlinearly, which Atsushi Nemoto and myself observed in my lab.&quot;
                    <br />
                <p>This experimental result should be of great interest to the
                    <br />
                    individuals interested in biological information.

                <p>The phrase &quot; a non-definitional variable&quot; is a novel contribution to
                    <br />
                    the mathematics of physics. I have no idea what you are trying to
                    <br />
                    communicate. It would be helpful to have other examples of &quot; a non-
                    <br />
                    definitional variable&quot; in mathematics and science.
                    <br />
                <p>Is the issue that is bothering you the necessity to tokenize
                    <br />
                    continuity? Does this issue emerge from the situational tokens of
                    <br />
                    &quot;quanta&quot;?
                    <br />
                <p>Is this logic enmeshed in Russell's denotational fallacy?
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poly-modal nature of biological / biochemical logic does not
                    <br />
                    encounter this challenge to existential identity. Why not? Is it
                    <br />
                    because the natural numbers allow the construction of consistent
                    <br />
                    empirical narratives that are consistently tokenized, consistently
                    <br />
                    named, consistently inferred from?
                    <br />
                <p>Does the issue of a &quot;non-definitional variable&quot; pose an existential
                    <br />
                    threat to a logical conceptualization of quantum types? (I do not
                    <br />
                    understand why one desires to interchange natural existential
                    <br />
                    variables for abstract existential variables; what concept am I
                    <br />
                    missing?)

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this regard, occurrence of a Planck's quantum is very
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; peculiar in that both the context (the particle-like nature) and

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contextual elements (the wave-like nature) appear

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously as bare empirical phenomena, instead of as logic.
                    </em><br />
                <p>A very curious sentence. Do you wish to imply that such a profound
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    in terms of quantum logic, can I? :-) :-) :-)

                <p><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may correspond to appearance of a new type in the sense that it
                    </em><br />
                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; remains robust even in presence of adverse disturbances. It would

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; de novo disturbances are imposed. One unique aspect with a Planck's

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a nonlinear quantum coherence as pointing to appearance of a

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; further new type if it remains robust. This will be a matter of

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck's quantum has been so. Once the robustness is empirically

                    <em class="quotelev1">&gt; guaranteed, one may wish to apply to it propositional logic,

                <p>May I propose a &quot;gedanken experiment&quot;? This experiment is motivated
                    <br />
                    by the intense intensity of concern with the distinction between
                    <br />
                    token and type.
                    <br />
                <p>Suppose that one wished to create a &quot;physics of mysticism&quot;, a magical
                    <br />
                    world:
                    <br />
                    where any logic worked, a world
                    <br />
                    where everyone's thought was logically true, a world
                    <br />
                    where the concept of information was useless.
                    <br />
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Please note, I am only imagining a &quot;gedanken experiment&quot;, I do not
                    <br />
                    wish to offend those with a spiritual bent!)
                    <br />
                <p>I assert that one could NOT create such a physics from the natural
                    <br />
                    numbers.
                    <br />
                <p>Would it be possible to create a &quot;physics of mysticism&quot; from the
                    <br />
                    mathematical concept of continuity?
                    <br />
                <p>If such a &quot;physics of mysticism&quot; was created from the mathematics of
                    <br />
                    continuity, could you propose a theory of information that it would
                    <br />
                    support?
