Dear Loet, Pedro, Jerry, Koichiro and all,
<br />
<p>as you know the word Chemistry has its origin in Arab: 'al-kimiya' which
<br />
means the art of transforming metals (particularly into gold). Chemists are
<br />
in some way experts in metallic 'trans-lations' (= Latin 'transl-latere'= to
<br />
bring from one (local) place into another one and so (!) to change its
<br />
properties).
<br />
<p>There is in some way a chemistry of language, i.e., the art of translations
<br />
and sometimes we dream from a meta-language (the language of unified
<br />
science, as was called in Vienna at the beginning of the past century), and
<br />
some of us might think this is indeed mathematics and nowadays: the
<br />
'im-presssion' or 'in-formation' of the dual code 0/1 into the
<br />
electromagnetic medium. Therefore we may also think today that we have
<br />
understood something in its being when we have grasped it in a digital way
<br />
(also in case we grasp 'material' things or whatever). I call this
<br />
perspective our present 'digital ontology' which does not mean that we think
<br />
(in a New-Pythagorean way) everthing IS digital, this would be digital
<br />
metaphysics, which is in some way the view taken by Italo-Oxford philosopher
<br />
Luciano Floridi with his philosophy of information, see also his book (ed.):
<br />
The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy and Information&quot; 2004) and
<br />
particularly his fascinating essays on this subject in his website.
<br />
What I mean is less dramatic (or metaphysic) it 'just' means that we take
<br />
(in everyday life but also in science) a (mostly implicit) perspective about
<br />
the meaning of being in order to grasp things in their being, and that this
<br />
perspective (which is then more epistemological than metaphysical) is
<br />
characterized today by digital technology.
<br />
<p>This is, so to speak, our (historical) 'local' perspective and... we always
<br />
have a local perspective, as we are 'beings-in-time' (animal rationale et
<br />
mortale). This is where Koichiro's thinking in/about time joins, if we make
<br />
this kind of 'trans-lation' the realm of (scientific) thinking out of what
<br />
happens in/with molecules. Instead of looking for a kind of meta-language of
<br />
science we are looking now, under timely conditions, for different kinds of
<br />
'trans-lations' from one (scientifc) idiom into the other. Ghis question of
<br />
translation was also thematized for instance by Quine and other in the last
<br />
century.
<br />
<p>We could also say, that we cannot grasp anything from all kinds of
<br />
perspectives at once due precisely to the fact that we are 'in' time. We
<br />
have to make our choices, but reality is alwas 'as a whole' there. So when
<br />
we try to 'imitate' something (I join now the discourse and theory on the
<br />
nature of the artificial as developed by Massimo Negrotti, Univ. of Urbino)
<br />
we have to make our choices (concerning its substance and/or processes).
<br />
What we get is something artificial with regard to something considered to
<br />
be 'original' (not: natural, Negrotti criticizes the classic distinction
<br />
natural/artificial). In some sense this is also what happens wenn we
<br />
('chemically') trans-late from one language/place to the other. We have
<br />
sometimes the (mad) idea  (or illusion), we could translate everything
<br />
(every language) into 'our own' (our so called 'mather tongue'), but halas,
<br />
we 'dis-cover' (with time, in time, timely?) that it is much more
<br />
'realistic' (and thrilling!) to 'trans-late' ourselves (and our Selves) to
<br />
other places (and idea developed by Heidegger in some of his late writings
<br />
and not far away from late Wittgestein's 'Sprachspiele') to other 'places'.
<br />
This means also to take this 'metamorphic'  (beyond forms) condition of
<br />
language not as something we should or could avoid (by creating a
<br />
super-language), but something we can profit from as it allows us not only
<br />
to change (ontological) perspectives, but also to grasp beings in their
<br />
specific appearence. This is, I believe, what Jerry tells us with regard to
<br />
the language of Chemistry as grasping the phenomena (of substance structures
<br />
and their possible transformation) less with mathematics that with graphs:
<br />
not that we could not also look mathematically at substances, but then we
<br />
loose a specific 'chemical' perspective.
<br />
<p>If we take this view with regard to the process itself of how scientific
<br />
theories (and other kinds of responses to reality such as religions, art
<br />
etc.) develop, we can conclude (and this was one intention of my mail on the
<br />
historical origins of today's digital ontology) that some transformations
<br />
happen (and other do not) and that we are not the absolute 'masters' of this
<br />
process, i.e., we think and in some way 'are thought' or 'co-respond' (give
<br />
an answer together with....) to what phenomena through our own theories and
<br />
practices tell us they are/can be. In some way we can give reasons for this
<br />
process, historical ones (context of discovery) as well as systematic ones
<br />
(context of justification), but it is amazing, I think, that we respond to
<br />
some perspectives or 'messages' (as we can call them) and not to others.
<br />
What are the reasons for our own theoretical and practical preferences? Why
<br />
do we 'believe' (or 'take for granted') in one message and not on the other?
<br />
Why Newton and not Goethe? Why Galileo and not the Bible? Why Jesus and not
<br />
Mani? why...? What are the 'conditions of credibility' (to speak in a
<br />
Kantian idion) of messages? (and we live more and more in a 'message
<br />
society' where this process is becoming extremely complex...)
<br />
There are of course a lot of possible reasons for these preferences, but in
<br />
some way they (or at least some of them) remain a 'mystery' in the sense
<br />
that there is a chaotic process of trans-mission (also in the sense of a
<br />
'mission' with regard to a 'message) that is not only a question of
<br />
geographical 'location' (and trans-location or trans-lation) but also what
<br />
local expectations (related many times to pragmatic aspects of survival).
<br />
This was the background of my short mail on the origin(s) of today's digital
<br />
ontology going back to Greek speculations on mathematics (numbers and points
<br />
as separated from their 'natural' place in 'natural' beings = physei onta),
<br />
through Logics (Scholastic), Lull etc.etc.
<br />
Just very shortly the question of etymology: it is at the opposite of the
<br />
programm of a unified and univocal (and universal and meta-local or
<br />
meta-physical) language (of 'science'). No question: searching for the
<br />
'true' meaning (=etymon) of words does not solve any problems but it might
<br />
help to weaken the strong illusion of a super-stable language (of course we
<br />
need in science clear concepts and univocity, but as in physics, sometimes
<br />
we take our wishful thinking for the whole of reality and... we loose the
<br />
possibilities offered by 'relativity'). In this sense 'etymological'
<br />
speculations (playing with language and its often absurd and/or joyful,
<br />
ridicoulous, laughable...aspects: but it is in fact the our own 'human'
<br />
medium!....) if we grasp them ironically that might helpf us to make
<br />
solluble (as in Chemistry) what seems to be hart and for ever. Our
<br />
mis-understandings often at the origin of our best (and, worst) ideas (and
<br />
actions)!
<br />
<p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Rafael
