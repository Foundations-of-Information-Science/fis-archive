                <p>
                    Dear colleagues
                    <br />
                <p>I have the impression that there is an agreement about the existence of biological and sociocultural
                    constraints that impact on our ability to understand and manage socioeconomic complexity. These
                    constraints are organized hierarchically, as Stan puts it, {biological {sociocultural }}. As far as
                    I can tell, social science is not much interested to explore the constraints below the biological,
                    and if we take the perspective of evolutionary psychology, than the psychological level may be
                    subsumed in the biological.
                    <br />
                <p>Perhaps we could address socioeconomic complexity from the minimum of three different perspectives:
                    behavioral, informational or semiotic and material (the latter refereeing to the artifacts and
                    material substances that we pile up in our environment and which impact we cannot fully understand
                    nor control; e.g. products of nanotechnology; toxic chemicals, weaponry).
                    <br />
                <p>One behavioral and informational aspect of socioeconomic complexity can be identified in unintended
                    consequences of political actions aimed to design an institutional framework in order to achieve
                    certain social or economic purpose. Consider a simple example of the liberalization of electric
                    energy market in the US, UK and more generally in the EU. The aim of policy makers was to unbundle
                    the vertically integrated companies (power generation, transmission, distribution and supply) in
                    order to create a competitive environment which would ensure investments in new capacity and in
                    energy efficiency, and at the same time drive down the prices of electrical energy to the consumers
                    and industry. What happened after nearly twd decades of liberalization (apart the California energy
                    crisis in 2000/01) is that prices were fluctuating quite unpredictably, originally deintegrated
                    firms (like in England and Wells) started to vertically integrate while cross-border mergers and
                    acquisitions created bigger and more powerful energy companies than before (market concentration was
                    one of the thing that lineralization wanted to change). According to some authors none of the
                    original aims (price reductions, energy-efficiency, new investments) was fulfilled.
                    <br />
                <p>Now, the point for me is not that an unintended consequence did happen but the fact that policy
                    makers in the EU are continuing to push institutional reforms in spite of the fact that it does not
                    seem to work the way they want it. As long as we do not postulate that there is a hidden agenda
                    behind their stated goals, then either the decision makers are not rational (beacasue they push the
                    agenda with full awareness that it will not work) or they do not understand the processes and the
                    constraints they hope to affect. The latter may be the sign of the (social) system inability to
                    achieve certain goals in a complex sociocultural environment. This would not be surprising: the
                    signs that come from the energy market are not fully consistent and thus allow for different
                    interpretations; there are several competing theories that may be used to explain the market
                    dynamics and make predictions; interpretations may be biased by different ideologies and worldviews.
                    <br />
                <p>The liberalization of the energy market is a complexifying process: from the monopolistic, and state
                    regulated to the competitive, and profit driven industry. In this process institutional constraints
                    are continuously added: markets are composite institutions themselves and to these the policy makers
                    add numerous new rules to achieve their specific goals. The aim to streamline the energy sector by
                    using markets with additional institutional constraints may exceed our capability to handle the
                    process and forsee the consequences. To some extent, it may be a sign of diminishing returns to
                    complexity in problem solving that Joe addressed in his book &quot;The collapse of complex
                    societies&quot;.
                    <br />
                <p>If we cannot manage the energy sector to serve certain social and economic goals, how can we hope to
                    be able to manage more complex situations like the climate change, poverty reduction and population
                    growth in the South?
                    <br />
                    Did we reach the limits (cognitive and cultural) to manage our complex world?
                    <br />
                    (I guess I put another crazy question again...)
                    <br />
                <p>Best
                    <br />
