I am having some trouble posting while travelling. Here is another try:
<br />
<p><p>Soren said:
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now this discussion goes deeper into the relation between meaning and information,
</em><br />
<p>and Andrei  and I seem to be more on the same track, that information  - in
<br />
<p>Shannon's sense - can me seen as the quantitative aspect of meaningful messages.
<br />
<p>But does it make it less meaningful talking about information without meaning
<br />
<p>in the physio-chemical world as one aspects of the description of the organization
<br />
<p>processes of life? Such a use seems to be the general way to use it also for
<br />
<p>the Wienerians. But they then forget to talk about meaning.
<br />
<p>The dictionary meaning of &quot;information&quot; is ambiguous between meaningful information
<br />
<p>(interpreted) and mere data. Data does suggest a user, or at least a receiver.
<br />
<p><p><p>Shannon's information concerns channel capacities (an average information per
<br />
<p>message). His brilliance is in showing that there is a best coding for each
<br />
<p>message to achieve maximum channel capacity. I don't really think it has much
<br />
<p>to do with meaning, though his work does imply the existence of &quot;messages&quot;,
<br />
<p>but it seem to me that anything that has the right mathematical properties fits
<br />
<p>his theory equally well.
<br />
<p>In any case, there are many interpretations of what Shannon was doing around,
<br />
<p>and of his place in lareger view of information theory as well. Each of these
<br />
<p>views, inasmuch as they are coherent, has some place in the canon of information
<br />
<p>theory no matter what Shannon's real views were (I understand that he kept them
<br />
<p>pretty close tom his chest).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I feel more and more that one of our purpose could be to classify all the different
</em><br />
<p>approaches, definitions of information and their consequenses to make the positions
<br />
<p>more clear. Part of that could be a working towards the minimum requirement
<br />
<p>for defining a concept of information. Both Wiener and Shannon  reflected too
<br />
<p>little on the metaphysical backgrounds for their conceptualizations and that
<br />
<p>has created a lot of misunderstandings about the subject area of different conceptions
<br />
<p>of information.
<br />
<p>I agree with this completely. On the ontology, I think Donald Mackay had the
<br />
<p>most minimal definition: information is a distinction that makes a difference.
<br />
<p>Everything else is more elaborate. For example, to add the user aspect, we get
<br />
<p>. makes a difference to the state of some receiver. For meaning, we need to
<br />
<p>make the receiver a mind, and so on.
