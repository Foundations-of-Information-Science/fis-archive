<p>
Dear colleagues,
<br />
<p>TECH. NOTE
<br />
Given that we are establishing a record of the whole discussion (thinking
<br />
in possible Publication References) it is better if messages are
<br />
self-contained and do not &quot;drag&quot; the previous ones at the bottom. It will
<br />
also allow a cleaner printing presently, without unwanted repetitions.
<br />
<p>thanks --and enjoy the present anarchy.
<br />
---------------------------------------------
<br />
<p>Some personal COMMENTS on current points:
<br />
<p>- The discussion on the perennial problems of philosophy is fine, it allows
<br />
the emergence of deep views that actually are guiding more concrete and ad
<br />
hoc sci. endeavors of each one. I am skeptical, however, that the very
<br />
small advancements that the fis community has made during these years are
<br />
providing  (YET) a basis to re-enter in such big philosophical topics in
<br />
order to say something relevant.
<br />
<p>- Comparatively, there are significant novelties in some disciplines that
<br />
may allow, in a medium term, the construction of interdisciplinary
<br />
synthesis of some interest. Anyone aware of the biomolecular-neurocomp.
<br />
developments will have to concede that the news about signaling systems,
<br />
second messengers, protein degradation, apoptosis, trophic interactions,
<br />
cytoskeleton, streaming tissues, ontogenic development, synaptic sites,
<br />
neuronal maps... are conveying a sense of elegance and integration in the
<br />
biological way of &quot;being in the world&quot;. That conevergence is actually
<br />
spurring quite a few synthetic attempts (every month a new product of the
<br />
Santa Fe &quot;complexity factory&quot; is in the market).
<br />
<p>- The dissatisfaction with most of those present sci. synthesis, and also
<br />
their scarse consideration on subtle properties of info phenomena and the
<br />
poor connection with other fields of thought and scholarship, is a
<br />
permanent reminder that some other trend of thought will have to make the
<br />
job. Could the fis thought-collective make significant advances? That´s not
<br />
a small challenge to our puzzle-making habilities...
<br />
<p>- Personally, an important new fact, an enormously intriguing new piece of
<br />
the info puzzle, is the intensity and extension of the &quot;negative&quot;,
<br />
degradative phenomena that are inevitably accompanying the selfproducing
<br />
activities. Biologists had completely ignored this fact up to the last 5- 8
<br />
years, now it is trendy. This strange phenomenon, coupled with Per Bak
<br />
&quot;Self-organized criticality&quot; and the new insights on cellular signaling
<br />
systems excites thought about a new info concoction that may have an
<br />
interdisciplinary interest.
<br />
<p>- The formalization of an enlarged (Wolfang would say &quot;unified&quot;) info
<br />
theory, covering also the communication by means of evanescent
<br />
compositions, does not look an impossible thing. Perhaps this is the
<br />
&quot;other&quot; way to put symbols at work. The firmest hunch is that every
<br />
organismic cell has sculpted its own cellular &quot;brain&quot;, cel. signaling
<br />
system, in order to make coherent operations upon such messages and be able
<br />
to speak the language (or &quot;language&quot; if philosophers get too offended) of
<br />
its own tissue. Anyhow, that is the piece of the puzzle I would like to
<br />
briefly discuss during the bio conference. Particularly given that Ray
<br />
Paton and IPCAT colleagues will be around with quite a few other pieces of
<br />
the bioinfo puzzle with interdisciplinary relevance.
<br />
<p>- I cannot help but reiterating my present skepticism about the deepest
<br />
ontological considerations. When Cao and Aitchison (1997, Nature, 388, p.
<br />
340) discuss, in the context of theoretical physics, about STRUCTURAL
<br />
REALISM (I played by heart and partially failed with the term in my last
<br />
message--thanks, Soeren), they hold that &quot;the structural relations between
<br />
entities (often expressed by mathematical structure) in a succesful theory
<br />
should be taken as real, rather than the entities themselves&quot;. Perhaps
<br />
that´s all far we can presently go on most of the paradoxes of &quot;quantum&quot;
<br />
existence, apart from being very suspitious in front of both particles
<br />
and/or waves...
<br />
<p>- There is another realm of human activities that can contribute to sharpen
<br />
our present scientific views, not merely philosophy and religion. It is
<br />
art. Particularly literature, also painting. The intuition of life as
<br />
inexorably linked with its own self-destruction can be found purely and
<br />
elegantly expressed in Virginia Wolf and Marcel Proust (and of course, in
<br />
Cervantes and Goya!)
<br />
<p>bests
