<p>
Dear FISers,
<br />
<p>The very interesting messages recently posted deserve each one a careful 
<br />
reading and discussion --utterly impossible amidst the usual turmoil. So I 
<br />
will reduce myself to briefly deal with a couple of ideas in Kevin's which 
<br />
are easier for my own background.
<br />
<p>On the distinction between form and substance in the living, an extra 
<br />
difficulty is that almost everything we may observe is in the making--and 
<br />
in the dismantling. That concrete ribosome may be targeted for destruction, 
<br />
or in the process of being translocated to some compartment, or in the 
<br />
middle of some other controlling interaction --apart from its &quot;regular&quot; 
<br />
function which involves dozens of specific molecular recognition 
<br />
encounters. I do not mention that as an impediment, but as an extra realm 
<br />
of multifarious interactions that TOGETHER contribute to notably enlarge 
<br />
the &quot;function&quot;. Evolutionarily we may put it under the exaptation 
<br />
label,  or perhaps also under some of the emergent properties of 
<br />
biomolecular networks derived from their peculiar interconnectedness... (it 
<br />
will be quite interesting starting that discussion next weeks!). In any 
<br />
case, it seems that the peculiar embodiment of biomolecular 
<br />
&quot;functions&quot;  grants them a dense lot of &quot;non formal properties&quot; --and 
<br />
tradeoff possibilities.
<br />
<p>About Witgenstein, and the language &quot;running empty&quot;, it also reminds me 
<br />
streaks from a few philosophers who around that time attempted different 
<br />
&quot;organicist&quot; schemes (Ortega y Gasset and his &quot;rationalism-vitalism&quot;, 
<br />
Whitehead, Merleau-Ponty, Needham, ...). Perhaps, as R. Dunbar has more 
<br />
recently dealt with, language emerges as a form of social &quot;grooming&quot; in a 
<br />
primate group scheme--curiously, after laughter and music. More than 70 % 
<br />
of language of anyone is really &quot;empty&quot;, and merely devoted to elementary 
<br />
contacts between individual life-cycles devoid of any substance... Every 
<br />
day the world is circled by a wave of human communications --by any means-- 
<br />
billions of them, and almost all of them saying the same. Could it be, as 
<br />
McLuhan said, that merely &quot;the medium is the message&quot;, or perhaps are we 
<br />
substituting &quot;fullness&quot; and &quot;density&quot; for emptiness? As Karl would say, 
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; appears as &quot;empty&quot;, as distinctions cannot be made. Than, let 
<br />
me try this: the &quot;void&quot; in the plenitude regarding the advancement of the 
<br />
life cycle is the meaning of the information which appears as the empty 
<br />
spot in the everything ---and formally, maybe one has arrived into the 
<br />
province of symmetries, or into Koichiro's boundary crossing...
<br />
<p>all the best
<br />
<p>pedro  
<br />
