<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Stan and I] disagree as to whether or not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;second law is the final cause of all organization. Stan feels it is. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I would like to elaborate on this since that could bring in
<br />
something of importance to economic networks.  I champion full use of all
<br />
the Aristotelian causal categories: material / formal, and efficient /
<br />
final. We could see these as: what something happens to / what happens to
<br />
it,  and, when it happens / why it happens.  All four are involved in any
<br />
event whatever.  Traditionally science has exluded final cause -- why
<br />
something occurs.  However, it would be allowed by most folks that in the
<br />
economic framework finality would have a place, since humans are allowed to
<br />
have agency.  I insist on bringing in final cause to any scientific inquiry
<br />
of any matter whatever.  Examples relative to science would be: classical
<br />
Aristotelian TELOS, which can be seen in the guidance of embryonic
<br />
development by genetic information; development occurs in order to
<br />
materialize a species' information.  In mathematical models we have the
<br />
pull on dynamics of STRUCTURAL ATTRACTORS; e.g., in Darwinian discourse
<br />
reproduction occurs in populations in order to maximize fitness.  In
<br />
dynamical systems we have the governance of dynamics by BOUNDARY
<br />
CONDITIONS; dynamical processes occur at all only because there are in
<br />
place values for CONSTANTS in the governing equations, which 'call for' the
<br />
results.  Of more direct implication in my dialog with Bob is the
<br />
Aristotelian idea that a final cause is that FOR WHICH something occurs.
<br />
Given that (because of its accelerated expansion) the Universe is very far
<br />
from thermodynamic equilibrium, all events tend to contribute to Universal
<br />
equilibration, and locally this goes by way of entropy prduction.  Nothing
<br />
happens irreversibly without producing entropy, and in usual cases more of
<br />
available energy goes into entropy than into exergy.  Because of this
<br />
generally poor energy efficiency, it is legitimate to say that whatever
<br />
occurs does so IN ORDER TO PRODUCE ENTROPY.  The construction of anything,
<br />
as in self-organization, involves this as well.  Self-organization occurs
<br />
so that entropy may be produced.  Now, this is not reductionist because I
<br />
fully acknowledge other finalities, which can be accounted for by using a
<br />
specification hierarchy, such as:  {physical process {chemical interaction
<br />
{biological tendency {sociological intent}}}}.  Thus, ranking final causes,
<br />
we have as a very current example: {entropy production {seeking lowest free
<br />
energy {male agression {warfare}}}}.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My take is that the creation of entropy is &quot;accidental&quot; to all real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes, not always causative.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Thus Bob eschews final causality.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In particular, I see in autocatalysis a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;self-entailing&quot; aspect that is not derivative of any associated gradient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in energy (or exergy, to be more exact.)
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: So autocatalysis can occur without any energy input?
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence, my opinion is that nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not all scripted by the second law.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Note that I do not say everything is scripted by the Second Law; I
<br />
say that it is involved in everything irreversible.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is an opposing tendency,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attributable mostly to the action of autocatalysis (and the partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;autonomy thereof) that acts in almost dialectical fashion against entropy.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: My take is that this works WITH the Second Law.  Indeed, since all
<br />
gradients are unstable to metastable, they all must be dissipated.
<br />
Autocatalysis, and any building-up tendency, is simply parasitic upon this
<br />
necessary dissipation.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The metaphor of the dialectic is important, because the opposing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tendencies are actually mutually obligate at a larger scale. But I won't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bore anyone further with that now.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: I can accept &quot;mutually obligate&quot;.  Dissipation (as a material
<br />
cause)makes autocatalysis possible; autocatalysis furthers the aim of
<br />
dissipation (as a final cause).
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;The issue of loss of socioeconomic diversity is closely related to that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;of scale of dissipative processes: as the number of industrialized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;economies increases (maximum power efficiency increases)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      SS: &quot;efficiency&quot;?  What is this efficiency?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is efficiency in the first law sense of the word, i.e., use of power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is to be distinguished from &quot;efficiency&quot; in its second law sense of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;word, which is extent of utilization. I.e., a given amount of energy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;available to a system. The degree to which that energy is utilized is its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;efficiency in the second-law sense of the word.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: OK. So increasing power results in lowered rnergy efficiency, and
<br />
so more kinds of waste products are produced, so we can easily calculate
<br />
First Law conservation.  So Bob's use of &quot;efficiency&quot; above is really
<br />
anti-energy efficiency.
<br />
<p><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The two senses are not entirely compatible. To utilize power at a high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rate requires a system to export lots of unutilized energy. Conversely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maximal utilization can be approximated only at very low rates, as Odum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Pinkerton explained in their 1955 article (Am. Sci. 43: 331-343.) When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resources are very abundant, efficiency in the first law sense seems more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;significant, whilst when there are very rare, second law efficiency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;becomes the decisive factor. Ascendency was scripted to bridge the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transition from one to the other. When resources are abundant, first law
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;efficiency prevails and maximal power (in the sense of Alfred Lotka, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exhibited by an increasing TST) is a decisive advantage. As they become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rare, increasing ascendency is maintained by second law efficiencies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inherent in a high AMI.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS: Sounds good to me.
