<br />
<p>Response to Comments by Marijuan and Darvas.
<br />
<p>I agree with Pedro that information, in one important sense, must be
<br />
restricted to living things. But I also agree with Gyorgyi that the
<br />
basic way we must understand the emergence and life and information-use
<br />
is within a general framework of cosmic evolution, phase transitions,
<br />
and symmetry breaking. So how to reconcile these two viewpoints?
<br />
<p>I think it is crucial to make a twofold distinction: (1) between
<br />
structure and information, on the one hand; and (2) between intrinsic
<br />
(or what I have called &quot;autotelic&quot;) and extrinsic (&quot;allotelic&quot;)
<br />
information, on the other.
<br />
<p>To take the second distinction first, the way I see it, the term
<br />
information is deeply ambiguous. Most often, we use it to mean any kind
<br />
of reduction in degree of freedom that produces structure, and certainly
<br />
any structure or order whatsoever can be characterized in
<br />
information-theoretic terms. But we forget that, while the order or the
<br />
structure exists objectively, apart from our act of observation, to
<br />
characterize this order as &quot;information&quot; means (or ought to mean, if we
<br />
are careful about how we use words) that we as observers are attaching a
<br />
meaning to the pre-existing structure. That is, I don't think we ought
<br />
to simply identify &quot;information&quot; with structure, not only because it
<br />
offends common usage, but because it glosses over the heart of the
<br />
problem, which is to account for the semantic or normative aspect of
<br />
information use.
<br />
<p>I think we can make all this clearer if we keep in mind the difference
<br />
between considering an organism (say, a living cell) from the outside,
<br />
via an act of observation, versus considering how it goes about its
<br />
business intrinsically, objectively, as it is in itself. That is, we
<br />
must always be careful to distinguish the epistemic and ontic planes
<br />
when thinking about life and information, and realize that our knowledge
<br />
of the cell is one thing, and the cell's own existence is something
<br />
else.
<br />
<p>Now, we can examine any structure at all in the cell from the outside
<br />
and call that &quot;information&quot;. But the way the cell uses &quot;information&quot; to
<br />
organize its own activities is another matter. I have articulated a
<br />
&quot;dynamical&quot; model of how we might conceptualize information in the
<br />
latter sense (as a low-energy trigger correlating functional behavior
<br />
with the appropriate circumstances), but be that as it may, however we
<br />
wish to understand information-use by organisms as it is in itself, it
<br />
is crucial to keep that idea separate from the way in which the
<br />
structure of a cell can constitute information for us as observers. In
<br />
short, we must distinguish information for one organism (us) ABOUT a
<br />
second organism (the cell) from information FOR the cell itself.
<br />
<p>Now, relating this distinction back to Gyorgyi's point about symmetry
<br />
breaking (1) above: We can say that while all order in the universe has
<br />
evolved through a sequence of symmetry breakings, all of which
<br />
consitutes information for us as observers, only one of those symmetry
<br />
breakings---the transition to life---gave rise to a type of dynamics
<br />
that created information, by establishing a dynamical regime with
<br />
conative, normative, and semantic aspects. In short, information, as
<br />
opposed to mere structure, only came into the world with the ability of
<br />
organisms to USE structure AS information in the dynamical sense.
<br />
<p>To sum up, while in the subjective, extrinsic, observer-dependent sense,
<br />
all structure can be considered information---for us, as observers---in
<br />
the objective, intrinsic, observer-independent sense, there simply was
<br />
no information at all before the origin of life, because there were no
<br />
systems yet able to enter into the right sort of dynamical interactions
<br />
that are in fact constitutive of information-use.
