Dear Rafael, Koichiro and All:
<br />
<p>The following comments and questions may be a bit radical for this
<br />
group; nevertheless, it is possible that they are of some interest to
<br />
some.
<br />
<p>Prof. Dr. Rafael Capurro wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I we start (as we do,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when we do science) from the present tense, then, I guess, we have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility (or only the _leap_) to bypass to the other one. But this start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not the original point of view. Evolution starts with the present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progressive tense and science comes (logically and temporally _after_ and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore always too late). So the _leap_ (or _jumping back_) is possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because we are primarily as living beings in the present progressive tense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rafael
</em><br />
<p>I question how any thought, including scientific thought, could be
<br />
initiated outside the present progressive mode.  By what criteria can
<br />
one differentiate active thinking into scientific thought and, for
<br />
example, ethical thought?
<br />
<p>A basic metaphysical question needs to addressed before these
<br />
suggestions become persuasive to me.  Given the limitations of semantic
<br />
expressions, (that is, linear sequences of words composed into
<br />
sentences) which should be given priority in scientific discourse: 
<br />
matter? time? space?  
<br />
<p>These three terms are tightly intertwined and interlinked in empirical
<br />
observations.  What personal values are authors co-communicating when
<br />
one of these three, for example, time, is selectively given semantic
<br />
priority?  (Prigoginian thermodynamics is very forthright in proposing
<br />
that time should be given priority!  And, by separating entropy flow in
<br />
time into endo and exo components, one could argue that space is
<br />
elevated into a secondary position.  This is all rather ironical; if one
<br />
starts with the third law of thermodynamics, then entropy exists only as
<br />
a consequence of matter in motion! (Recall that the third law of
<br />
thermodynamics states that all motion ceases at absolute zero
<br />
temperature. Empirically, experiments by Morowitz in the 1960s showed
<br />
that living organisms could be cooled to very, very near absolute zero
<br />
without significant  loss of viability upon warming to normal
<br />
temperatures.  These empirical  experiments imply that biological
<br />
information is independent of heat entropy.)) 
<br />
<p>If time is given metaphysical precedence over matter and space, then can
<br />
it be treated as anything other than a continuous variable?  If one
<br />
starts with time as a continuous variable, then one is adopting some
<br />
version of the coherence theory of truth.  The flows of time in natural
<br />
systems (as exemplified by expereinces such as watching a river flow, a
<br />
bird soar, a deer flee or a garden grow,) are not readily objectified. 
<br />
In order to objectify, one must imagine objects, objects with at least
<br />
some aspect of stability in time.   Such objects are then subject to
<br />
another theory of truth, ie, the correspondence theory and the
<br />
accompanying rules of counting or enumerating.  (Frege  and Dummett have
<br />
both explored the implications of these two theories of truth.)  
<br />
<p>The notion that:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science comes (logically and temporally _after_ and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore always too late).
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
needs to be critically examined.
<br />
<p>Consider, for example, antibiotic therapy for infectious disease, the
<br />
construction of weapons, travel by jet planes, and internet
<br />
communications, which are based on a sense of trust, intiguity and value
<br />
about the course of future events.  From my perspective, the essential
<br />
nature of science is predictability. In the absence of some sense of
<br />
predictibility, either in the coherent, correspondent or pragmatic sense
<br />
of truth, one is hard pressed to call it &quot;science&quot; in the normal usage
<br />
of the scientific community.  Thus, to me, the profound implication of
<br />
science for values, ethics and morals is the nature of predictions
<br />
emerging from it and the subsequent impact on our humaness and our human
<br />
habits.
<br />
<p>Rafael's suggestions generate the following questions:
<br />
<p>1. What criteria can be formed to assign prioty to matter? time? or
<br />
space?
<br />
2. What mechanisms can be formed within any natural science which allows
<br />
for a &quot;leap in time&quot;?
<br />
3. Is it a scientific or a metaphysical question to speak of the &quot;start
<br />
of evolution?&quot;
<br />
4. Should scientific values be excluded from the set of human values?
<br />
5. How are scientific values differentiable from other human values such
<br />
as those expressed in law, medicine or accounting, or even mathematics?
<br />
6. If one views biological information from the perspective of third law
<br />
and its empirical  existence at absolute zero temperature rather than
<br />
the second law and Shannon information, will a fundamentally different
<br />
perspective of the relationships between science and values, ethics and
<br />
morals emerge? 
<br />
<p>My own thinking and writings are often grounded on a positive answer to
<br />
the sixth question.   
<br />
<p><p>Cheers
<br />
<p>Jerry LR Chandler
