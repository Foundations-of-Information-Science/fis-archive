                <p>
                    Dear friends,
                    <br />
                <p>We have a wonderful measuring instrument, our number system, which is lovely
                    <br />
                    and reliable, tautologic, in itself exact. Our only problem is that if we
                    <br />
                    lay this measurement instrument over the thing we measure it with, we cannot
                    <br />
                    understand the measurement results.
                    <br />
                    Either we say that we cannot recognise the thing measured deeply anyway
                    <br />
                    (Arne), or that we are at loss what to think now, or that we re-check the
                    <br />
                    instrument. The idea that our counting-measuring instrument needs more
                    <br />
                    precision derives from the observation what we measure and by which methods:
                    <br />
                    it is similarity all over the place. We think and count in ideas of
                    <br />
                    similarity.
                    <br />
                    As we state that 12=5+7 we assume that each of the 12 units is alike and is
                    <br />
                    interchangeable with any of the other 11, regardless of in which subset they
                    <br />
                    are in. As we state 5+7=6+6, we consciously disregard the existence or the
                    <br />
                    importance of an obvious difference, namely the arrangement of the cuts.
                    <br />
                    If anyone has jobbed as a student in a clothes factory, he knows that the
                    <br />
                    cutting patterns are as existentially essential to the functioning of a
                    <br />
                    clothes factory as the cloth. Without the archive of cut patterns, no
                    <br />
                    clothes will be produced. The cuts themselves are not easy to see, because
                    <br />
                    they are always represented on something, and as soon as we see something we
                    <br />
                    see something similar, because we are built like this, thanks to Darwin.
                    <br />
                    The cuts do have properties and these properties can be systematised into a
                    <br />
                    counting method (an algebra) with units and operations.
                    <br />
                    We see that genetics operates on the basic principle that it counts dually:
                    <br />
                    something that exists in biology must have existed in a sequenced form (as
                    <br />
                    its dns), exists now as a commutative assembly and will recopy itself into a
                    <br />
                    sequence (by means of the testes). So it does have a double existence in two
                    <br />
                    algebras: in one for sequences and in one for commutative arrangements.
                    <br />
                    Even, if multidimensional partitions are too complex to be defined, they can
                    <br />
                    be counted and we can infer from their number that they are sur-, in- and
                    <br />
                    bijective to the number of linear sequences. The mechanics is complex but
                    <br />
                    logically it is no news. We regard one and the same collection of logical
                    <br />
                    objects that carry symbols at the same time as a collection of named
                    <br />
                    individuals that can be sequenced and as an overlap structure. We can
                    <br />
                    densify information by switching from a sequence into a structure and back.
                    <br />
                    The two logical languages genetics uses are a clever trick. We can copy
                    <br />
                    parts of the trick by using two algebras concurrently. Leaving the old,
                    <br />
                    usual, normal N-based algebra as it is, we parallelly conduct each and every
                    <br />
                    operation on N also in the other algebra, which details the dissimilarity of
                    <br />
                    the objects.
                    <br />
                    In the clothes factory we now check additionally, whether the cut patterns
                    <br />
                    are available for this stitch job. Heretofore we only stated that the
                    <br />
                    material extends enough, we now check how viable is the business from that
                    <br />
                    standpoint that we neglected to regard as we said 3+3=2+4. The kinds and
                    <br />
                    numbers of cuts constitute an algebra.
                    <br />
                    Using the cuts algebra alongside the stitch-algebra presently in use has
                    <br />
                    following immediate effects:
                    <br />
                    About 90 % of additions do not match the test of the D-algebra;
                    <br />
                    The remaining about 10 % have a double .t. value;
                    <br />
                    One counts in a system that works irrespective of size;
                    <br />
                    The natural unit is the saturation numbers of electron sheaths;
                    <br />
                    The counting system is more exact by about 0.3E-96 %.
                    <br />
                    This alone should be worth to look into the matter.
                    <br />
                <p>Let me repeat: using a more complex optical instrument we can recognise muh
                    <br />
                    more. The improvement comes from using a parallel visor which counts in
                    <br />
                    representation of a property of sets which we have heretofore neglected. The
                    <br />
                    resulting counting system is slightly more demanding to use and to service
                    <br />
                    but generates a grid before which quite many impressions can much better be
                    <br />
                    understood.

                    <br />
                <p>Hi Karl,
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    The answer is NO, but then this also applies to many other objects, such as
                    <br />
                    stars and tornadoes. All dissipative systems churn non-linearly, so I guess
                    <br />
                    you would argue that the laws of Newton generally don't apply to dissipative
                    <br />
                    systems as wholes. I wouldn't argue with that; however I refered to the
                    <br />
                    laws of physics, rather than the laws of Newton, which I meant to include
                    <br />
                    far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems, like &quot;biologic bodies&quot;.
                    <br />
                    &nbsp;
                    <br />
                    Regards,
                    <br />

                    <br />
                <p>the laws of Newton do not apply in biology. Or, have you ever seen a
                    <br />
                    biologic body that remains in an idle state or keeps its linear movement
                    <br />
                    forward?
                    <br />
