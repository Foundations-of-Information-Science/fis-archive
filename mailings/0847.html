<p>
dear colleagues, dear friends,
<br />
<p>some comments on the ongoing session.
<br />
<p>pedro in his message from 15th nov was wondering whether the divide between
<br />
the two cultures (natural and social sciences) may easily be overcome. he
<br />
and me and maybe many of us (like heiner in his mail) feel that this
<br />
situation is an expression of still immature science and that a fully
<br />
fledged information science should be able to bridge the gap.
<br />
<p>my own considerations and the considerations of my vienna group (thanks to
<br />
the interventions of godó and christian) which deals with presuppositions
<br />
of an as-yet-to-be-developed unified theory of information advocate to take
<br />
the concept of self-organisation as background to which the information
<br />
concept can be linked. in doing so, a deep unity of social and non-social
<br />
systems can be envisaged: both are just different types of self-organising
<br />
systems. thus, investigations into social self-organising systems (= social
<br />
sciences) and non-social ones (= natural sciences) are not so different as
<br />
they appear in the history of science. they have something in common, and
<br />
on the basis of this commonality they differ. we have to elaborate a
<br />
conjecture of a social theory which hypothesises the differentia specifica
<br />
of the social while having in mind the genus proximum: self-organisation.
<br />
<p>so i am not as pessimistic and would like to encourage directing research
<br />
towards accounts of the generic and the particular in one. this is in line
<br />
with christophe who proposes to focus on the evolution underlying the
<br />
generation of information. for looking at evolution means to filter out
<br />
what is continuous (that is the general) and what is discontinuous (that is
<br />
the particular). i think it is the nature of (not only) scientific
<br />
endeavour to construe generalisations. therefore we are striving for some
<br />
kind of a grand theory (and what john h. suggests when he talks about what
<br />
we term &quot;information&quot; - is'nt this too a generalisation, is it?).
<br />
<p>pedro introduced the distinction between endo- and exoinformation. this is
<br />
certainly an important issue when trying to find out the difference between
<br />
natural information-generating systems and social ones (the endo-side - an
<br />
engine that generates information transformations (by self-organising
<br />
processes?) - being something that links us with the biotic realm).
<br />
<p>pedro uses this distinction at the same time to ask whether or not here
<br />
lies the ground for problems of present information society which he sees
<br />
in the exo-skeleton suffocating the endo-side. yes, there is a trend to
<br />
look upon the information processes going on in our societies only from the
<br />
technical perspective, that is, from the perspective of objectivated,
<br />
materialised exo-things. but isn't it worth trying to put the question
<br />
&quot;what for?&quot;, to regain control over the means of communication, that is, to
<br />
make them instruments for implementing a humane society, for achieving a
<br />
sustainable society? that is what elohim seemingly intends to point out.
