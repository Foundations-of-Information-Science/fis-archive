Michael was a true brilliant spirit and scientist at the same time. It was a wonderful
experience when Pedro and I worked with him on<br>
the FIS issue of Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing. It is a great loss for us all. The best
we can do is to make use of all the wonderful<br>
work he did.<br>

Dear Colleagues,<br>
<br>
still I cannot believe that our good friend Michael passed away. If this is really true we
should do something. What about a special issue<br>
of BioSystems or any other appropriate journal. Since he acted as Co-Managing editor of
BioSystems, may be this journal is most<br>
appropriate to devote several articles to his memory. I would be ready to contribute an
article, who would join me?<br>
<br>
best wishes to you for the New Year<br>
<br>
Werner<br>

I join Werner's proposal. Michael was a person of extraordinary personal qualities,
unforgettable as a friend, and the most distinguished<br>
scientist of our fis enterprise. Perhaps Roberto Kampfner, Koichiro Matsuno, and
Peter Erdi could orientate all of us in the best way to<br>
contribute to commemorate him. During this month I will finally know if a fis
conference is funded in Spain this year. In any case, the<br>
next of our meetings should be devoted to him.</p>

Just now I was informed by Koichiro, Michael passed away. I feel very deeply deporessed,
and remembered his smile.<br>
I also join Prof. Werner's proposal.<br>

I am deeply depressed by the news that Michael Conrad passed away. He was a brilliant
person and excellent scientist. With<br>
gratitude and warmth I remember communication with him at the FIS Congress in
Vienna and later in correspondence. I am<br>
sending condolences to everybody who knew and respected him and support Prof.
Werner's proposal to commemorate him in<br>
the special issue of BioSystems and at the FIS meeting.<br>
