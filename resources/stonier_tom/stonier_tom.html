<p><strong><a name="Obituary">Obituary</a> for Tom Stonier
from the Guardian of England<br>
</strong>by: Geoffrey Goodman</p>

<p>Tuesday June 29, 1999</p>

<p>Tom Stonier A man of computers and peace Geoffrey Goodman
Monday June 28, 1999 Professor Tom Stonier, who has died aged 72, was frequently called
the &quot;professor of futurology&quot;. For more than four decades he examined the
ingredients of technological and scientific change, pointing out how our social, economic
and political environment was in the process of transformation. </p>

<p>He was a humanist, scientist and poet-philosopher. It was
Stonier who, more than 25 years ago, began a campaign to transform our education system,
linking it with the development of computers, which he saw as liberators of human talents.
He recognised very early on that a combination of education and computers would unlock the
door to the information society, and argued that education had to become the most
important investment in the future of all societies. </p>

<p>Stonier was born in Hamburg to a German-Jewish father and a
French mother. In 1939, when he was 12, the family fled to New York, where he read biology
at Drew University before taking a PhD at Yale in 1955. He began his scientific career as
a research associate at Rockefeller University before joining the biology faculty at
Manhattan College, New York, in 1962. </p>

<p>His first book, Nuclear Disaster, published in 1964, was
based on his 1961 report to the New York Academy of Sciences which dealt with the
biological and environmental effects of dropping a 20-megaton bomb on Manhattan. The book
won world-wide attention and drew Stonier into the limelight as a pioneer proponent of
peace studies. In 1973, he came to Britain and founded the school of peace studies at
Bradford University.</p>

<p>In 1975 Stonier was appointed to the foundation chair in
science and society at Bradford, where he specialised in the interaction of science,
technology and society. His six books and countless monographs included The Wealth Of
Information: A Profile Of The Post-Industrial Economy (1983), Information And The Internal
Structure Of The Universe (1990), Beyond Information: The Natural History Of Intelligence
(1992), and Information And Meaning; An Evolutionary Perspective (1997). His most recent
book, No More War: The Hidden Evolution To Peace, will be published next year. Consulted
widely by governments throughout the world, Stonier lectured in Canada, Australia, China
and south-east Asia. He was also consultant to some of the largest international
companies, a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and a life fellow of the Royal
Society of Arts. Stonier reached the conclusion that computers were contributing to a
biological change in the nature of human beings as well as human relationships: &quot;The
increase in computer power has been roughly 10-fold for every six or seven years over the
last 30 or more years,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;At this rate, early in the next century
computer power will be about 1,000 times that of today's machines.&quot; </p>

<p>He is survived by his wife Judith, seven children and six
grandchildren. </p>

<p>* Tom 'Ted' Stonier, academic, born April 29, 1927; died
June 15, 1999.</p>

<p>Dear Judith and family,<br>
Tom was a very brilliant multidisciplinary scientist, pioneering the
creation of this new field of studies of Information Science. But above
all, I personally found him an affable and kind colleague, always
comprehensive of any problems and circumstances one could have in
professional and family life. We all will miss a brilliant colleague and I
will miss a good friend.</p>

<p>My personal condolences and of my family<br>

<p>Dear Judith<br>
We met in Wienna at the FIS conference some years ago. Allthough Tom and I
disagreed very much scientifically we had a very warm relationsship and I appreciated his
attitude towards science and other people very must. I still use his books. He made a
great work!</p>

<p>My heartfelt condolences<br>

<p>Dear Judith and Jefferson,<br>
I deeply regret Toms dead. I remember many interesting discussions we had
had in the Vienna Prater when he attented the FIS conference. I never will
forget his helpful, generous and humorous attitude. His contribution to the
understanding of information will stay within the memory of the academic
community.</p>

<p>Feeling with you<br>

<p>Dear Judith and Jefferson,<br>
I am profoundly touched by your information. Tom was one of the most
brillant espirits I had the oportunity to meet in my life and he had great
influence on my way of thinking.. </p>

<p>With deep respect<br>

<h4>Definition of information</h4>

<p>TStonier (<i>tstonier@compuserve.com</i>)<br>
<i>Thu, 6 May 1999 17:38:44 +0200 (MET DST)</i> </p>

<p>I recently received a communication from Jim Logan of
&quot;Infodynamics, Inc&quot; asking about what appeared to him contradictory definitions of information
in my Information trilogy. Below are the answers that I wrote him. I 
would welcome colleagues' comments. It does fit into the discussion of 
creating a taxonomy of information.</p>

<p>Dear Jim,<br>
Thanks for your communication of May 4th. As you can see, I have retired
to the wilds of Western Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The apparent contradiction in defining information in
various ways is a
reflection of our insistence that information must be one kind of thing. 
That is, one definition fits all. First, we should be talking about
information systems and information processing systems, not merely about
information per se. When we try to define information, we almost always
put it into some sort of system (e.g., DNA, Computer, Human speech, etc.). 
Each of the several examples I cite in Information and Meaning (Chapter 3)
involves entirely different vehicles for the transmission and storage of
information and for interpreting the signals. Second, we should understand
that we are, at the end of the 20th C, about where the physicists were at
the end of 18th C in grappling with the concept of &quot;ENERGY&quot;. We are only
now beginning to lay the foundation of a Science of Information and have
little understanding of the interconvertability of one form of information
for another (Information transduction), but at least I have developed some
quantification of the conversion of information to energy and vice versa. </p>

<p>On pgs. 17-19 (Information and Meaning) I compare how
parallel are the
concepts of &quot;information&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;. Remember that the concept of
&quot;energy&quot; is only a few centuries old and that it was not until the middle
of the 19th C that scientists began to understand that one form of energy
could be transduced to another and to be able to write the equations of
this conversion. The reason I speculate on the existence of &quot;infons&quot; is to
focus attention on the &quot;physical&quot; reality of information. </p>

<p>As to your specific questions. The first and most important
fact is to
understand that Information is a basic property of the universe, like
energy, and like energy it has a reality of its own.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here? First, it leads to a much clearer
understanding
of the transfer and transduction in physical information systems. This
ridiculous concept of &quot;entropy&quot;, dear to the hearts of physical scientists
and engineers, can be done away with and described more simply as increases
in entropy reflect decreases in organization, hence information. And, as
Information and the Internal Structure of the Universe describes, one can
calculate this loss of organization in terms of bits lost.</p>

<p>Second, an organized system may become more organized as a
result of adding
more information to it. If one looks at the evolution of technology, for
example, many inventions became increasingly more efficient by later
improvements added on. The same holds true for biological evolution, and,
for that matter, the evolution of any system (e.g. human language). </p>

<p>The important thing to remember is this. There are
information systems
which are different from, but build on more primitive information systems
in order to exist. There exists a large and very elaborate hierarchy of
information systems. As I said, I believe Information Science to be in a
state which is about 200 years behind the physicists. It won't take us 200
years to catch up, but we badly need to develop a taxonomy of information
and information systems to truly understand the matter. You might find
Chapter 3 of Information and Meaning helpful in these discussions.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for your interest. If you have further
questions or
comments I would be happy to engage in further discussion. I will send you
this by E-mail with hard copy to follow. I may also put it out over the
FIS (Foundations of Information Science) network.</p>

<p>With cordial best wishes. Sincerely,</p>
