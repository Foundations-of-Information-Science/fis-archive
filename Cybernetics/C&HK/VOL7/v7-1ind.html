The Embodied Mind and the Baldwin Effect</font></font></font>
<p>by Bruce Weber and Soren Brier</center>

<p>In early November 1999, a week long, interdisciplinary conference convened
at Bennington College in Vermont to discuss the integration of the evolutionary
origins of mind and brain with emerging principles of developmental and
evolutionary biology. A group of scholars from biochemistry, psychology,
philosophy, developmental biology, and cognitive science discussed how
the interaction of contingency, natural selection, and self-organization
might lead to the open-ended biological order on which development depends.
To this discussion, several participants brought their current ideas about
the contours of an evolutionary synthesis that robustly integrates developmental
biology, psychology, molecular and population genetics. Others brought
approaches related to fundamental problems of brain and mind development,
from movement to language, including issues of meaning.
<p>The question addressed by the invited participants as well as students
and faculty of Bennington College was: can an expanded evolutionary synthesis,
informed by complex system dynamics and enriched by developmental systems
theoretical and semiotic perspectives, bring within its orbit a study of
mind as a biological adaptation? How could ideas of self-organization and
autopoiesis, biosemiotics, Uexk&uuml;llian Umweltlehre and language as
a new social selective environment for the development of the brain inform
modern search for a "second order new synthesis of evolutionary theory"
to deal in a more comprehensive way with the emergence of mind and signification
in human evolution?
<p>In organizing the conference, it was decided early on to focus on the
issue of the "Baldwin effect," originally suggested early in the twentieth
century by psychologist James Mark Baldwin. We did so because it has been
proposed as an important mechanism in the evolution of brain/mind by authors
as diverse as Daniel Dennett and Terrence Deacon. We felt that it was important
to explore the background and history of Baldwin’s suggestion and to evaluate
it in light of current experimental and theoretical knowledge as well as
philosophical analysis. Since Terrence Deacon had argued that the Baldwin
effect might have played a key role in the co-evolution of human brain
and language and utilized semiotic notions in developing his ideas, we
included several biosemioticists in the program to get their perspective
on the Baldwin effect.
<p>This conference was the first in a multi-year series of conferences
and special classes planned at Bennington College on the topic of the Embodied
Mind. In introducing the conference, Dr. Elizabeth Coleman, President of
Bennington College made the following statement.
<blockquote>Not surprisingly, an intellectual frontier generating great
excitement among our students and faculty—artists, scholars, and scientists
alike—is the convergence of biology, psychology, anthropology, philosophy,
computer sciences, and interestingly, the arts around the neurosciences,
the study of mind and brain. The Bennington consortium on Mind, Brain and
Behavior seeks to enter this frontier by pursuing a radical, multi-disciplinary
exploration of the implications of our rapidly expanding understanding
of how the brain works for our less developed understanding of how the
mind works and, ultimately, what it is to be human. We hope to engage artists
no less than scientists in this conversation.
<p>In addition to the intrinsic value of such an inquiry, we think it deeply
embedded in our understanding of a liberal education. Beyond being a subject
of immense value, in effect addressing what it means to be human, we also
suspect that in its need to embrace complexity and to remain dynamic and
open-ended it is also a way of thinking. It has, in addition, so many points
of access, demands so many different skills, capacities and interests and
offers an especially promising way of bringing so-called non-science students
into serious, authentic scientific learning. …
<p>Our working assumption is that whatever else might be said about mind,
it is mediated by the body and its brain. Yet another way to put it: biology
matters. That in turn means you had better get the biology right. And that
brings us to this gathering of scientists from all over the world, and
its coordinator Bruce Weber in the first in what will be an annual event.
Its purpose is to lay a groundwork for our inquiry by exploring the biological
and evolutionary base necessary for a comprehensive theory of mind-one
that robustly integrates developmental biology; psychology, and molecular
and population genetics.&nbsp;</blockquote>
The conference was organized such that there were many opportunities for
informal interaction between the participants and between the participants
and Bennington students and faculty. Bennington faculty members Ruben Puentedura
and Carlin Romano, as well as Bennington College President-emeritus Frederick
Burkhardt gave formal presentations allied to the conference. The conference
sessions themselves were held in the evenings in the Usdan Gallery. This
provided a special venue of contemporary art specifically assembled for
the conference. Bruce Weber, who was a visiting faculty member for the
fall semester, taught a course in the philosophy of biology at Bennington
College. Students from his class (Nathan Anderson, Amy Bashford, Lise Johnson,
Anatte Kormendi, Joseph LaCasse, York Marble, Chandra Reber, Adina Singer,
Dana Visser, Caroline Williams, Katherine Wilson, and Edward Zarsky) presented
formal responses to each of the presentations of the participants in this
conference organized by Bruce Weber.&nbsp;
<p>The speakers at the conference, in alphabetical order were: Robert Berwick
(MIT), S&oslash;ren Brier (Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University,
Copenhagen), Terrence Deacon (Boston University), David Depew (University
of Iowa), Steven Downes (University of Utah), Scott Gilbert (Swarthmore
College), Peter Godfry-Smith (Stanford University), Paul Griffiths (University
of Sydney), Jesper Hoffmeyer (University of Copenhagen), Kalevi Kull (University
of Tartu), Celia Moore (University of Massachusetts, Boston), Susan Oyama
(CUNY), and Bruce Weber (California State University, Fullerton). Most
of the presentations will be prepared as book chapters for a volume edited
by David Depew and Bruce Weber expected to be published by MIT Press in
a year or so.&nbsp;
<p>It was not possible to publish even shorter versions of the full range
of papers here. Therefore, we have instead selected some of the central
papers that address issues about the Baldwin effect for inclusion in this
special issue of Cybernetics and Human Knowing. On the basis of the context
of the idea of this special issue authors were asked to develop journal
articles documenting and explaining the new developing views on organic
evolution and their relation to the original idea of "The Baldwin Effect".
<p>David Depew provides an historical context for the Baldwin effect and
how our changed concept of genes, development and evolutionary mechanism
has paved the way for a new view of the possible role of mind in evolution.
Bruce Weber and Terrence Deacon explore how complex systems dynamics and
developmental systems theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding
evolutionary emergence of life, language and mind including such phenomena
as that purported to occur in the Baldwin effect. Kalevi Kull provides
a semiotic interpretation of the Baldwin effect as a post-Darwinian mechanism
of evolutionary change based on the interesting alternative approaches
to evolution, where selectionism is only a part of a greater concept of
evolution. Finally S&oslash;ren Brier writes about the relation between
cognitive motivation in living systems and linguistic motivation in human
languages. Drawing on knowledge from ethology and cognitive semantics he
shows how the two kinds of motivation can be seen as connected in an evolutionary
perspective. To do this he uses biosemiotics based on Pierce and von Uexk&uuml;ll
and the embodied metaphor theory of Lakoff and Johnson’s version of cognitive
semantics.
<p>Bennington College provided a beautiful and congenial venue for an interdisciplinary
conference exploring such a complex topic. In addition to the special show
at the Usdan Gallery, a group of Bennington dancers led by Susan Sgorbati
made a special presentation instantiating those principles of self-organization
taken as paradigmatic by most of the conference participants. In an effort
to capture the flavor of the vital interactions of the arts and sciences
at Bennington College, we have included two poems by Bennington poet and
Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner Mary Oliver and paintings
by former Bennington art faculty member Pat Adams.&nbsp;
<p>On our request Fredrik Stjernfelt has written a review of Terrence Deacon&acute;s
book The Symbolic Species.
<p>Ernst von Glassersfeld this time writes the ASC-column on the concept
of feedback. In this volume we will alternate between Louis Kauffman and
Ranulph Glanville as columnist to keep the number of columns to two per
issue. Louis Kauffman starts with a piece on infinitesimals and Zero Numbers.
<p>We welcome Terrence Deacon as a new member of the editorial board and
Kalevi Kull as consultant editor.
