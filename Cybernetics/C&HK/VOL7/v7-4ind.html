<p><b>Special Issue: Reflective Practice in Learning and Research</b></center>

<p>The idea of editing a special issue of the journal with contributions
from Hawkesbury arose in conversations between Sriskandarajah and Soren
Brier at the beginning of this year, following the move by the former to
the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University (KVL) in Denmark. He had
been with the Agriculture and Rural Development academic group at University
of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury in Australia for fourteen years. We were
both new appointees to KVL’s Section for Learning and Interdisciplinary
Methods, a small group of faculty dedicated to offering courses in problem-oriented
project-based learning and preparing undergraduates for such a pedagogic
approach.&nbsp;
<p>The curricular initiatives undertaken by this group at KVL over the
past ten years were inspired by developments at Hawkesbury over two decades.
As the Hawkesbury group was known for its innovative curriculum built on
linking a systemic view with experiential learning, and its compatibility
with second order cybernetics and autopoiesis theory, to us it seemed appropriate
to ask some of the pioneers from there to reflect on the Hawkesbury experience
and its possible development and global relevance. Further, we wanted to
connect this to research already ongoing at the national level in agriculture
in Denmark and in the areas of philosophy of cognition, information and
communication science at KVL.
<br>For this issue we invited three papers from present and past members
of the Hawkesbury faculty. Richard Bawden draws from his long experience
leading the curricular reform within the School of Agriculture at Hawkesbury
Agricultural College (later to become the University of Western Sydney,
Hawkesbury). What began as a critique of the limits of the existing techno-scientific
paradigm to explore ‘better agricultures’ and a search for more systemic
ways of developing natural resources evolved into a suite of undergraduate
and graduate systems programs with strong experiential foundations, and
a community of critical, experiential learners made up of students and
faculty alike. Bawden bases his arguments for Critical Learning Systems
and the epistemic development of the people who are part of these systems,
on the experience of the Hawkesbury faculty and its insistence on praxis
— on the knowing and doing for being. Learning then is not simply to know
systemic perspectives or do systemic methodologies as a management practice
on ‘matters to hand’ but also learning ‘about and from themselves as the
basis for the action they take’, to be and become critical learners.
<p>To give voice to the experience of the learner, we bring a poetic reflection
on the lived experience of being a student at Hawkesbury by Michelle Rush.
Michelle’s Masters program required that development of professional praxis
came through reflective practice, and projects and experiences emphasised
core competencies of learning, inquiring, communicating and developing.
<p>The beginnings of the reform in agricultural education at Hawkesbury
in fact were in 1970 when a post-experience program in Rural Extension
was designed for graduates in practice. While the discipline of Agriculture
was being redefined in the context of Rural Development within the School,
a parallel development that took place was the birth of Social Ecology
as a ‘new autopoietic entity’. Robert Woog and Bob Hodge examine the life
cycle of Social Ecology as an academic program at Hawkesbury and present
it as ‘fluid, self organizing’ and switching between a modernist interdisciplinary
project and a post-modern transdisciplinary project, depending on the mindset
of the observer. They propose that an understanding of second-order cybernetics
would enable the academy to recognize and think of such emerging programs
in their ‘full and complex form’ instead of seeing them ‘as a problem of
disciplinary imprecision to be eliminated’.
<p>Ray Ison and David Russell, reflecting on experiences at Hawkesbury
and beyond, discuss the act of making a distinction. They further present
a concept of enthusiasm as theory and methodology and propose that both
have application in the design of purposeful learning systems. They also
highlight the limitations of models of learning and communication that
are based only on dualistic thinking.
<p>But how do we connect this approach to learning with our understanding
of science? Hugo Alr&oslash;e’s paper on science as systems learning deals
with two main perspectives on science as a learning process: research as
the learning process of a cognitive system, and science as a social, communicational
system. A simple model of a cognitive system is suggested, which integrates
both semiotic and cybernetic aspects, as well as a model of self-reflective
learning in research, which entails moving from an inside ‘actor’ stance
to an outside ‘observer’ stance, and back. This leads to a view of scientific
knowledge as inherently contextual and to the suggestion of reflexive objectivity
and relevance as two related key criteria of good science. As such the
systematic reflection on observation and action becomes the link between
the scientific process and teaching. This is much in the original spirit
of the Humboldt university but now at a new level. It could be said to
be at a new turn in a spiral movement now, with an emphasis on the complexity
of both science, learning and praxis and on the ongoing self-reflection.
This reflective practice is informed by the praxis developed by Donald
Sch&ouml;n of reflecting on what we actually do and not only on our established
theory of what we ought to do. See the articles on this in Cybernetics
&amp; Human Knowing vol. 7 no. 2/3 devoted to Sch&ouml;n’s work.
<p>The ASC column is in memoriam of Herbert Brunn who died recently. Louis
Kauffman’s column is on the development from virtual logic to formal arithmetic
through operations on the void.&nbsp;
