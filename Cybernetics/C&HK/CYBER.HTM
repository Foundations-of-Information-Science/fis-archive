<font face="garamond, times new roman, times">Cybernetics and Human Knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;
is a quarterly international multi- and interdisciplinary journal on <b>second
order cybernetics, auotpoiesis</b> <b>and cybersemiotics.</b></font>
<p><font face="garamond, times new roman, times">The journal is devoted
to the new understandings of self-organizing processes of information in
human knowing that have arisen through the cybernetics of cybernetics,
or second order cybernetics and its relation and relevance to other interdisciplinary
approaches such as semiotics (cybersemiotics). This new development within
cybernetics is a nondisciplinary approach. Through the concept of self-reference
it tries to explore: the meaning of cognition and communication; our understanding
of organization and information in human, artificial and natural systems;
and our understanding of understanding within the natural and social sciences,
humanities, information and library science, and in social practices as
design, education, organisation, teaching, therapy, art, management and
politics.</font>
<p><font face="garamond, times new roman, times">Scientific endeavour in
the post-modern age is becoming increasingly complex and transdisciplinary.
Researchers and practitioners in the arts and the natural, medical and
social sciences realize that the sharing of knowledge is both desirable,
necessary and possible. For people working in the IT-sector, second-order
cybernetics can be translated to the understanding of his/hers cognitive
relation to the artificial system "user". In this, Cybernetics &amp; Human
Knowing is a valuable complementary to technologically oriented magazines
as we provide a rich epistemological soil for the emergence of future metaphors.
Our focus is on the need for change in the basic concepts of ourselves,
our cultures, world views, values and views of what "genuine" knowledge
is, and on the call for a new exchange between theoreticians and practitioners.
A basic feature of this work is the attempt to integrate scientific thinking
with ethical and aesthetic perspectives in both theory and practice, in
an attempt to bridge what C.P. Snow called "The Two Cultures".</font>
<p><font face="garamond, times new roman, times">The journal as such is
an autonomous knowledge and communication system, partly affiliated with
the American Society for Cybernetics but with editors from many other cybernetic
and systems organizations and journals and interested researchers from
semiotics. Because of the interdisciplinary character, articles are generally
written in such a way that readers from other domains can understand them.
Authors from a wide range of disciplines, whose common ground is a passion
for interdisciplinary, cybernetic, and semiotic description and explanation,
will write with a sensitivity for language that will make their ideas clear
and their subject fascinating. <i>Scientific papers are of course peer
reviewed</i>. Now and then, space will be given to more technical papers,
and a paper from a practitioner. The journal is thus a meeting place for
those developing cybernetic and semiotics with those doing cybernetics
and systemic work. The lay-out and illustrations of every issue is done
by an artist, whose contribution is an integral part of the journal. Within
this frame, embodying the creative with the (multi)disciplinary, the journal
has a high scientific standard and integrity - following Gregory Bateson's
model of rigor AND imagination.</font>
<p><font face="garamond, times new roman, times">The journal also support
colums where prominent researchers express their views on various aspects
of the subject area.</font>
<p><font face="garamond, times new roman, times">This strategy makes the
journal interesting and readable for those interested in cybernetic and
semiotic practice in government, industry, education, therapeutic fields
and the various fields of <i>information and communication sciences</i>.</font>
