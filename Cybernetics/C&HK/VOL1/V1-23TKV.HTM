<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>The paper explores musical instruments as an example of man-machine
interaction, and argues that the many complex types of interaction found,
may be of interest in a more general study of man-machine interaction.
To understand the relation between input and output, it is argued that
the output has to be viewed in terms of what the operator (musician) intends
to do, and concepts to study this relation in more detail are introduced.
