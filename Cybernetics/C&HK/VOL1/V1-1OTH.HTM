<I>Ethics as Second Order Morality</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>An attempt is made to combine the concept of second order cybernetics,
developed by Heinz von Foerster, with a modern concept of ethics. In this
perspective, ethics has no privileged point of view. Ethics is not a stable,
but a metastable set of rules, developed in a conversation between parties
affecting and affected by actions or decisions (the stakeholders). Ethics
is an example of &quot;obervation of observation&quot;, accepting no metaphysical
foundation, but open to change, relativism and pluralism. Ethics attempts
to integrate conflicting points of view in a frame of shared and revisible
values, thus balancing conflict and consensus. What is ethical depends
on what the stakeholders rationally can accept. The content of ethics is
unstable, while the form - the procedure - is stable. This concept of ethics
is used to combine two different lines of thinking. On the one hand, ethics
is seen as a second order morality, regulating the interaction between
subcultures with different morals. On the second hand, ethics is seen as
the &quot;criteria of criteria&quot; defined by Niklas Luhmann as a needed
regulator of problems arising around the medium-controlled subsystems developed
in modern society (such as economics, science, politics, and the arts).
Finally, these two lines are combined in the presentation of The Ethical
Accounting Statement, which tries to make ethics useful in modern organizations
by increasing their sensitivity to environmental noise. </P>
