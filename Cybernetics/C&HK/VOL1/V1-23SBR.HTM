<I>Information and Consciousness: A Critique of the Mechanistic Concept
of Information</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The paper presents a discussion of the epistemological
and ontological problems of attempts to found information concepts on the
often implicit mechanistic idea that the physical sciences hold the key
to the nature of reality and information. It is furthermore shown through
an analysis of the ethological and the Batesonian understanding of cognition
and behavior that it is impossible to remove the fundamental epistemological
position of the observer through a definition of information as neg-entropy.
Instead Maturana and Varela's concepts of autopoiesis and multiverse are
invoked. But where the idea to derive information from the concept of negentropy
is too physicalistic Maturana's idea of a multiverse seems to be too close
to a constructivistic idealism. To develop a more fruitful non-reductionistic
world view it is shown that the more pragmatic understanding of physics,
where thermodynamics is understood as the basic discipline and mechanics
as an idealization, opens for a non-reductionistic con-ceptualization of
chaos. Attention is drawn to C.S. Peirce's conception of pure chance as
living spontaneity which is to some degree regular as a realistic but non-reductionistic
theory, which comprises a solution to the different world view problems
of Bateson and Maturana. A fruitful connection between second order cybernetics
and semiotics will then be possible and a bridge between the technical-scientific
and the humanistic-social parts of cybernetics can be developed.</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Introduction.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In recent years a new area of growth in the interdisciplinary
sciences has created consider-able confusion about the proper basis for
reflections on the possibilities and limits of human knowledge. This interdisciplinary
growth area, called information science, cognitive science and artificial
intelligence draws on subjects such as information theory, linguistics
and philosophy of language, neuro- and computer science, anthropology.
With behaviorism's fall from greatness, cognitive science is scientific
rationality's newest and most powerful attempt to find a firm foundation
for knowledge. Gardner (1985 p.6 and 8) writes:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;I define cognitive science as a contemporary based
effort to answer long-standing epistemological questions - particularly
those concerned with the nature of knowledge, its components, its sources,
its development, and its deployment. (...)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Approaching these fields from a methodological point of
view, I raise the questions whether philosophy will eventually come to
be supplanted by an empirically based cognitive science, and whether anthropology
can (or even should) ever transcend the individual case study.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The idea of purely objective (empirically based logico-mathematical)
knowledge appears to be inherent to the basic philosophy of modern science
as Galileo formulated it. By insisting on, that the major qualities in
nature can be revealed by methods of measuring and weighing (empiricism),
that mathematics is nature's language and finally that nature is basically
composed of indivisible lumps of matter - atoms - the foundation was laid
for an unhampered hunt for knowledge about nature. There are no limits
to this mathematical, mechanical knowledge. A final insight and thereby
control of nature is seen as possible in this mechanical materialism whose
God is Laplace's demon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The philosophical attitude found in extensive areas of
research on artificial intelligence and the functionalistic areas relating
to it appears to be a type of mechanical materialism. One believes, apparently,
that information is something found in the &quot;world outside&quot;, independent
of the observer. As materialism at the present time is always joined with
a fundamentally evolutionist attitude, this view's logical consequence
is that information must have existed before the emergence of consciousness.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A recently published textbook &quot;Information Science
- Theory and Practice&quot; (Vickery and Vickery 1989, p.43) states that
information is just as fundamental a part of reality as matter and energy.
On the one hand they seem to represent a classical mechanistic view of
nature, and on the other they see nature as being full of information.
There is no doubt that Vickery and Vickery are promoting a materialistic
world picture where knowledge is more fundamental than the observer. A
world picture, where energy, matter and information are the basic elements,
as they state (Vickery and Vickery p.43). This makes life, consciousness,
humans and language later by products, whose creation and function they
probably expect science to explain &quot;in the long run&quot; through
the study of evolution, genes and artificial intelligence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In this fashion energy, matter and information become
mutually joined concepts that explain the emergence, formation, structure
and dynamic of mind and knowledge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>According to this world view <B>natural objective information</B>
must have been present before the living beings and the human minds occurred
on the scene in the history of the expanding Universe. In this view information
is more fundamental than the observer or interpreter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the mechanistic scientific view of knowledge knowing
is eternal and universal mathematical structures or laws which control
all movement, matter and force including those determining the behavior
of the living beings and language and rationality of the humans. It is
believed that the sciences have and will give us access to the fundamental
natural laws behind all matter. Mechanical scientific ideology would thus
seem to be close to the final scientific totalitarianism, where philosophy,
cosmology and epistemology are wrested from philosophy - as Gardner hints
at in the above quotation - and then become a total science that can be
formulated in &quot;nature&quot;s own language&quot;: mathematics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Accepting information as such an objective universal law-determined
thing, which humans absorb into their minds and machines from nature, change
and multiply by thinking, and bring into society through language, means
it must be possible to establish a new unifying science of information.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Information science then will also include cognitive science,
and all epistemological problems will be solved empirically. It is this
development - along with the development of the cognitive science(s) -
which has promoted the idea of a unified information science for man, machines
and animals. (The Vickery's even include all other natural systems). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The basic idea of cognitive science seems to be that information
processing follows certain <B>&quot;universal syntactic, logical and mathematical
laws&quot;</B>, among other things inspired by a mechanistic view of all
nature and by Chomsky's theory of a common &quot;deep&quot; generative
grammar behind all languages. This is the Cartesian foundation for cognitive
science. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Gardner (1985 p.6) sums up the basic goals and beliefs
of cognitive science very aptly:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;First of all, there is the belief that, in talking
about human cognitive activities, it is necessary to speak about mental
representations and to posit a level of analysis wholly separate from the
biological or neurological, on the one hand, and the sociological or cultural,
on the other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Second, there is the faith that central to any understanding
of the human mind is the electronic computer. Not only are computers indispensable
for carrying out studies of various sorts, but, more crucially, the computer
also serves as the most viable model of how the human mind functions....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The third feature of cognitive science is the deliberate
decision to de-emphasize certain factors which may be important for cognitive
functioning but whose inclusion at this point would unnecessarily complicate
the cognitive-scientific enterprise. These factors include the influence
of affective factors or emotions, the contribution of historical and cultural
factors, and the role of the background context in which particular actions
or thoughts occur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>As a fourth feature, cognitive scientists harbor the faith
that much is to be gained from interdisciplinary studies... .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A fifth and somewhat more controversial feature is the
claim that a key ingredient in contemporary cognitive science is the agenda
of issues, and the set of concerns, which have long exercised epistemologists
in the Western philosophical tradition.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So the idea is that feelings and cultural context are
not essential, the model for cognition is the algorithmic machine, and
the goal is that epistemology and cognition will be understood as aspects
of &quot;Human Information Processing&quot;. This is the title of Lindsay
&amp; Normann's widely used cognitive science supportive textbook on psychology
(Lindsay &amp; Normann 1977, and later editions). Here is an example of
how they state their view:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Nevertheless, the principles of information processing
are highly relevant to all systems that make use of information, including
the human mind. The general principles of information processing must apply
to all systems that manipulate, transform, compare, and remember information.&quot;</FONT></P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>(Lindsay &amp; Normann p.579)</FONT></P></DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This will eventually become a new super science: Information
science. This science will restructure the whole field of knowledge. It
will be a true science of sciences! And clearly mechanical physics is its
ideal of science.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Stonier (1990) writes about the need to develop a general
theory of information based on a physicalistic paradigm:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot; To create such a theory, we need to start with
the most fundamental aspect of information. And the most fundamental aspect
of information is not a construct of the human mind but a basic property
of the universe. Any general theory of information must begin by studying
the physical properties of information as they manifest themselves in the
universe. This must be done before attempting to understand the various,
and much more complex forms of human information. The next step must involve
an examination of the evolution of information systems beyond physical
systems - first in biological, then in the human, cultural sphere&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>(Stonier 1990 p.112-113)</FONT></P></DIV>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>My rejection of the above described paradigm of information
science is based on views similar to Machlup's (1983) and Winograd &amp;
Flores' (1987) statement that <B>information</B> basically is something
a <B>person communicates to another person</B>. And the <B>meaning</B>
of information <B>can only be understood considering living mindful beings
in a social/cultural context </B>and in an <B>historical perspective</B>.
Furthermore I agree with Machlup, when he points out, that you cannot even
define all sorts of information as having the ability to reduce uncertainty.
But the fact is, that some kinds of information will even make the receiver
more uncertain than they were before. I further agree with Searle (1986),
when he states, that the common link between information processing in
man and machines is not, that they both follow rules. Machines behave according
to causalities, only conscious beings can choose to follow rules.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In my opinion knowledge - or knowing (to underline the
process) - is a far more complicate &quot;thing&quot; or process than expected
from the above described &quot;information processing paradigm&quot;. According
to Thomas Kuhn's philosophy of science nature and human mind is not directly
linguistically connected through perception. Nature does not - in the usual
meaning of the word - talk to us or transfer information to us through
our observation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I think that a more fruitful way to look at it, is to
say, that nature is full of differences, but - as the ethologist and the
cybernetician Gregory Bateson (1973) points out - only some of them make
a difference to us and thereby they become information for us. Although
both theories represents fruitful alternatives to positivistic and mechanistic
thinking both the ethologists and Bateson look for a physicalistic foundation
for their theory of information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In this paper I will show how the works of the ethologists
and Bateson gives an alternative scientific explanation of what the nature
of information and cognition is. I will then analyze the shortcomings of
the search of the ethologist and Bateson for a physical foundation of a
theory of cognition and information for animals and man in the relation
between thermodynamics and information theory. I will show how the theory
of autopoiesis solves some of Bateson's problems about who the difference
makes a difference for, even though it is still unclear about the relation
between mind and matter. Finally I will show how the founder of semiotics,
C.S.Peirce, long ago gave a more frutful foundation of a theory of information
and knowing than any form of physicalism, has ever done.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>An ethological approach to cognition</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Approaching the problems of the mechanical foundations
of information it is relevant to discuss the fundamental problems of ethology,
the biological science of behavior, as ethology in a general way deals
with the cognitive and behavioral interaction between the organism and
its surroundings. (See Tinbergen 1968, 1973)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Ethology observes the interaction between organisms' behavior
and their milieu. Ethology is behavioral research with a theoretical foundation
of biological-natural history and asks questions as: how has behavior developed
phylogenetically and ontogenetically and how does it contribute to the
survival of the organism as an individual and as a species. Ethology's
goal is to describe and explain of the cognition and behavior of organisms
within an evolutionary-ecological frame of reference. Ethology is first
of all concerned with the instinctive forms of the specific innate behaviors
of species. Furthermore, ethology deals with the various forms of learning
that the different instinctive conditions make possible (see Bittermann
1965, and Lorenz 1976), partly where they show themselves as &quot;constraints
on learning&quot;, and partly where they occur as surprising outbreaks
of &quot;intelligent thinking&quot; (for instance, the special abilities
of rats to find their way in labyrinths). As Reventlow (1973) writes:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;As ethology demands that animal and human behavior
be examined in relation to their biotopes and at all times strives to understand
psychological phenomena on the basis of the relationships between stimuli,
motivation and behavior, ethology becomes one of the broadest psychological
theories in existence - and certainly the most ecologically oriented&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The model of reaction and releasing of behavior arrived
at after 50 to 60 years of work concerning behavior's internal organization
(a motivation model) is an attempt to &quot;integrate in a simple way the
effect situation, inner motivation and the outer-observable behavior&quot;
(Reventlow 1970) in a theory based upon the central concept of the &quot;innate
release response mechanism&quot;, which ethologists believe is found between
perception and the primarily instinct-guided behavior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Now, focusing on the concept of information, it is particularly
relevant to analyze at the innate release mechanism. Seen from the point
of view of the human observer, only small parts of the stimuli which usually
occur in nature are used to activate the behavior. These parts have been
characterized as &quot;sign stimuli&quot;, i.e.,stimuli which without previous
learning activate certain behaviors in an organism. Sign stimuli lead to
sensations which corporate with internally motivated conditions in such
a way as to release the genetically determined behavior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The salient point is that the action-releasing perception
of these sign stimuli is always connected to definite states of motivation!
When von Frisch's - the discovere of the language of the bees - studies
of the color sense of bees were published, von Hess denied that it was
possible for bees to differentiate between colors. The experiments he himself
had done on bees' escape behavior showed that they always flew toward the
patch of light with greatest intensity, regardless of color. Recent studies
shows that he was right, - but von Frisch was also right in claiming that
bees have a sense of color which they use when seeking food; there were
two different innate release response mechanisms, related to flight motivation
and the search for food, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The significant result from ethology concerning the relation
between reality, perception and information is that perception is not a
purely mechanical process where objective information is passively taken
in, - on the contrary perception requires motivation. All of ethology's
explanations of the release and functionality of behavior build upon this
concept of action specific motivation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>From an ethological point of view this type of process
is the primitive starting point for human perception. Our cognition of
information is controlled by &quot;interests&quot; that derive partially
from the nature of the perception apparatus (Lorenz 1976) and partly from
the innate release response mechanisms found in our organism. In his development
of the concept of instinct and motivation, Lorenz fought for a long time
with the causal role of the organism's mental experience in the release
of behavior (Brier 1980), but apparently ended in 1950 by finally denying
that it should have any causal role. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But in his later development of a theory of learning,
based on the instinctual structure as the foundation and constrain of the
organism's learning abilities, he again emphasizes experiential-emotional
aspects as reinforcements of in the trial-and-error process (Lorenz 1976).
Since it is basic to the theory that instinct and learning always function
together a shift in attitude is indicated (Brier 1980). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Beer (1982) (unfortunately without precise indication
of source) has found an apt description of this motivational-intentional
drive in the following quote from McDougall's pre-ethological definition
of instinct as: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;...an inherited and innate psycho-physiological
disposition which determines its possessor to perceive and pay attention
to objects of a certain class, to experience an emotional excitement of
a particular quality upon perceiving such an object, and to act in regard
to it in a particular manner, or at least to experience an impulse to such
action&quot;. </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Where organisms have to adapt fast to changes in their
environment their instincts eventually in the course of evolution &quot;open&quot;
different parts of their &quot;program&quot; towards learning; this often
often takes place in so called &quot;sensitive periods&quot;. Examples
are the &quot;imprinting&quot; of ducklings, the song learning of many
birds and children's language-learning. In the culturally based upbringing
of children the basic human motivations and needs are developed and differentiated
and with self-consciousness feelings are developed. From the phylogenetic
perspective of evolution, the differences that observers register are heavily
dictated by biologically and culturally created interest. To some extent,
different species and different cultures live in different worlds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Influenced by mechanistic thinking ethologists for many
years have attempted to find physiological explanations for the different
kinds of motivation and their influence on perception. Under the headline
&quot;Evidence for drive&quot; Thorpe (1979) has written the following,
which I consider to be very typical of the English school's relation to
the ontological status of the concept of motivation: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;We have shown above that a very real problem is
raised by the question of the motivation of particular stereotyped actions.
The name used by the pioneer ethologists, following Lorenz, was &quot;action
specific energy&quot;. This was a thoroughly bad term and was later softened
to &quot;specific action potentials&quot; etc. The increase in responsiveness
is an outward sign of an internal change, and what most, if not all, ethologist
want to discover is the physiological basis for such change. So the very
question of the internal motivation of specific acts leads us straight
into the general problems of &quot;drives&quot;&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But in a conclusive analysis of the role of the concept
of motivation in ethology and comparative psychology Hinde (1970) shows
that this is a logical category mistake. Hinde's conclusion on his critical
analyses is that explanations of motivation are founded on an entirely
different descriptive level from the physiological and behavioral descriptions.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One can perhaps expand the perspective in his conclusion
by pointing out that the concept of motivation can be said to occupy the
same position within ethology as the concept of life in biology and the
law of gravity or the attraction of masses in Newton's classical mechanics.
It is, in other words, an &quot;occult&quot; basic concept which cannot
be explained within the paradigm but which one cannot ignore.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Danish psychologist K.B Madsen (1978) documents this
position of the motivation concept in ethology and other schools of thought
within behavioral research in a paper summing up his many years of research
into the concept of motivation (Madsen 1974). He writes: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Under the name of &quot;instinct&quot;, &quot;need&quot;,
&quot;motive&quot;, &quot;tendency&quot; etc. the motivation variable has
been introduced into psychological theories to explain behavior. Therefore
one does not find the motivation variable in the psychological epochs or
schools of thought where psychology's task is looked upon as the description
of consciousness. One can not find motivation variables in classical experimental
psychology (Fechner, Wundt, Ebbinghaus, etc.) Only with the advent of Freud's
psychoanalysis and American learning theory did one attempt to explain
behavior by introducing concepts such as &quot;drive&quot; and the like
(for instance Freud's &quot;Trieb&quot; and Woodworth's &quot;drive&quot;.)
The concept of motivation spread from psychoanalysis to the theory of personality
(for instance, Murray's &quot;need&quot;). After world War II, motivation
psychology gradually became an independent psychological discipline...&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The concept of motivation would thus appear to be a &quot;remnant&quot;
from the classical psychology of consciousness in mechanistic behavioral
research. The desire to explain the release of observable behavior as dependant
on &quot;inner&quot; motivation, drive, tendencies, or needs appears to
be an attempt to turn the original phenomenological description level's
incentives and intentions to something a bit less subjective and anthropomorphic!
But this is not the proper way to make a theory of cognition more scientific.
Concepts of consciousness cannot in this way be reduced to physiology.
One can, at the most, claim that there is a one-to-one correlation between
mental conditions and (neuro) physiological states.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But as Jensen (1973) has shown such a correlation theory
can not be maintained. The human brain and the brain of the higher mammals
are so complex that it is highly unlikely that any nerve impulse would
ever run the same way, even in simple reflexes. Here we face an immense
complexity!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The complexity of neurophysiological states makes it necessary
to classify them based on some kind of interest or point of view. Jensen
points out that it is culture through language that performs this classification
for the referrals of the concepts via the conventions determined by the
surroundings during a child's upbringing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Karl Popper (1972 A) argues along the same lines in his
clash with the idea that scientific hypotheses via induction emerge spontaneously
from the researcher's observations. No matter how many times we have predicted
and observed an empirical phenomenon we can never prove the existence of
a natural law because, among other things, the experience of something
repeating itself is not a value-free, absolutely objective observation
but one based on a judgement of similarity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Hume's argument, which Popper develops further, is that
repetition is based on similarity. But repetition-for-us is based on similarity-for-us,
that is, we identify situations as identical. But it is highly unlikely
that the situations we observe are completely identical (they are in reality
too numerous and varied in composition and appearance). It can only be
a matter of similarity. The danish psychologist A.F. Petersen, who is developing
on Popper's theories within ethological perspective, writes (1972 p.46):
</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The problem of repetition arises the moment an organism's
viewpoint is introduced. The world of phenomena can not be shown to be
repetitive in its own right; we do not know whether the laws of nature
that have been revealed to us will apply in the future. The world of phenomena
has an objectively historic course, but no one can guarantee that the historic
laws we find apply for all time and in every milieu which might arise.
This does not mean that the knowledge an organism can possess must be subjective.
Figuratively speaking, the organism finds itself in the objective stream
of phenomena and by assuming certain attitudes towards this stream of phenomena
the organism will perhaps be able to discover phenomena which, seen from
its particular perspective, repeat themselves. This will perhaps reveal
itself at the first step to understanding certain connections between the
phenomena and to explain the respective connections within the given spatio-temporal
region&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Summing up, we can add that things can only be classified
and become identical or different in this way, i.e. by being placed in
relationship to needs or interests. This rule applies not only to animals,
but also to human beings - even to scientists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So the concept of information - although not purely subjective
- cannot be defined without the observer and his/its motivational and intentional
selective attention. How then can this problem be solved? I believe that
Gregory Bateson's cybernetic theory of mind is an interesting attempt to
give a new fruitful non-mechanical understanding of the relation between
the concept of motivation-intentionality and information.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Gregory Bateson's concept of information.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One of the major projects in Bateson's books (1973, 1980)
is an attempt to solve the problem of explaining the nature of mind on
a modern scientific basis, avoiding a metaphysical dualism &agrave; la
Descartes and the mechanicism of Laplace. Bateson is able to provide a
new delimitation of the concept of information, which attempts in a more
consistent way to unite a scientific and materialistic world view with
the concept of mind in agreement with a non-mechanistic view of ethology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Ethology then - in my view - provides a scientific basis
for understanding Bateson's redefinition of the concept of information:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;In fact, what we mean by information - the elementary
unit of information - is a difference which makes a difference,....&quot;
(Bateson 1973, p. 428)</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is a wonderful foundation for the understanding of
cognition in a world of complexity. The world view is not subjectively
idealistic or solipsistic. There is a world of differences or potential
information, but it is the observer who has to &quot;bring them forth&quot;
(to use the expression of Maturana and Varela 1986). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Bateson's world view is scientific and materialistic but
not mechanicistic. His &quot;working hy-pothesis&quot; of the world is
that its basic constituents are space, time, elementary particles (matter)
and energy. He thinks that science will come to an end if we have to endow
the elementary particles with mind qualities (Bateson 1980 p.103). His
project is to explain mind as a function of complexity and cybernetic organization.
Bateson believes that the strength of cybernetics lies in its ability to
provide a more profound understanding of what the mental is, incorporating
his concept of information in a universal cybernetic philosophy. Bateson
thought that his cybernetics could provide an understanding of mind which
was neither subjectively idealistic or mechanically materialistic. In his
work to unfold this vision he contributes to the development of the classical
cybernetics into second-order-cybernetics. There are two major reasons
why he did not quite succeed: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. He did not manage to develop the concept of autopoiesis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. He was not able to liberate his concept of information
from Norbert Wiener's. Al-though Bateson's definition of information seems
well suited for second-order-cyberne-tics he had - as I will show - tied
it to the concept of neg-entropy, which gives his theory a physicalistic
flavour.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Mind, information and entropy.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To Bateson mind is a cybernetic phenomenon, a sort of
mental ecology. The mental relates to the ability to register differences.
It is an intrinsic system property. The elementary, cybernetic system with
its messages in circuits is in fact the simplest mental unit, even when
the total system does not include living organisms. Every living system
has the following characteristics which we are accustomed to call mental:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;1.The system shall operate with and upon differences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2.The system shall consist of closed loops or networks
of pathways along which differences and transforms of differences shall
be transmitted. (What is transmitted on a neuron is not an impulse, it
is news of a difference).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3. Many events within the system shall be energized by
the respondent part rather than by impact from the triggering part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>4. The system shall show self-correctiveness in the direction
of homeostasis and/or in the direction of runaway. Self-correctiveness
implies trial and error.&quot; (Bateson 1973 p. 458)</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Mind is synonymous with the cybernetic system which is
comprised of the total, self-correcting unit that prepares information.
Mind is immanent in this wholeness. When Bateson says that mind is immanent
he means that the mental is immanent in the entire system, in the complete
message circuit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One can therefore say that mind is immanent in the circuits
that are complete inside the brain. But mind is also immanent in the greater
circuits which are complete inside the system &quot;brain + body&quot;.
Finally mind is immanent in the even greater system &quot;man + environment&quot;
or - more general - &quot;organism + environment&quot; which is identical
with the elementary unit of evolution, i.e. the thinking, acting and deciding
agent. This is the mind-system:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The individual mind is immanent, but not only in
the body. It is immanent also in pathways and messages outside the body;
and there is a larger Mind, of which the individual is only a subsystem.
This larger Mind is comparable to God and is perhaps what some people mean
by &quot;God&quot;, but it is still immanent in the total inter-connected
social system and planetary ecology. Freudian psychology expanded the concept
of mind inward to include the whole communication system within the body
- the autonomic, the habitual and the vast range of unconscious processes.
What I am saying expand mind outward. And both of these changes reduce
the scope of the conscious self. A certain humility becomes appropriate,
tempered by the dignity or joy of being part of something bigger. A part
- if you will - of God&quot;. (Bateson, 1973, pp. 436-37).</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Bateson is also clearly in line with the ethologists when
he resists the positivistic split between the rational and the emotional
in language and thinking which is so important for cognitive science. He
writes ( Ibid p. 438):</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;It is the attempt to separate intellect from emotion
that is monstrous, and I suggest that it is equally monstrous - and dangerous
- to attempt to separate the external mind from the internal. Or to separate
mind from body. Blake noted that &quot;A tear is an intellectual thing&quot;,
and Pascal asserted that &quot;The heart has its reasons of which reason
knows nothing&quot;. We need not be put off by the fact that the reasoning
of the heart (or of the hypothalamus) are accompanied by sensations of
joy or grief. These computations are concerned with matter which are vital
to mammals, namely matters of relationship, by which I mean love, hate,
respect, dependency, spectatorship, performance, dominance and so on. These
are central to the life of any animal, and I see no objection to calling
these computations &quot;thought&quot;, though certainly the units of relational
computation are different from the units which we use to compute about
isolable things&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It thus seems obvious that Bateson's &quot;pattern that
connects&quot; includes the phenomenological-emotional dimension in its
concept of mind. In my opinion this cybernetic viewpoint tells a great
deal about what motivational and emotional functionality is, seen in an
ecological and evolutionary framework. It seems to avoid physicalistic
explanations. But it has its limits.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Autopoiesis, mind and information.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The first major obstacle for Bateson's theory in its attempt
to become a general theory of information and knowing is the difficulty
of determining to whom or what the difference makes a difference. His concept
of mind-system is too general to be the agent to whom the difference makes
a difference as it extends from the smallest feedback loop in machines
to the working cybernetic system of Gaia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In my view Maturana has developed this analysis an important
step further. Maturana's and Varela's (1980) definition of the autopoietic
system answers the question as to whom the difference makes a difference.
It is the autopoietic system that is able to react to differences (perturbations).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The point is that the autopoietic system does not receive
information in an objective physical sense and responds to the stimuli
or information as it would be understood in a mechanistic paradigm. No,
it is a closed organization whose main concern is to stay organized, to
survive. It does so by changing its organization when its coherence is
threatened by perturbations from &quot;outside&quot; or by spontaneous
behavior from inner parts. This we can observe as physiological reactions
and behavior. Through this autopoietic process the organism brings forth
a world. Maturana (1988 p.26) writes:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;... a composite unity whose organization can be
described as a closed network of productions of components that through
their interactions constitute the network of productions that produce them
and specify its extension by constituting its boundaries in their domain
of existence, is an autopoietic system; and second, that a living system
is an autopoietic system whose components are molecules. Or in other words,
we propose that living systems are molecular autopoietic systems and as
such they exist in the molecular space as closed networks of molecular
productions that specify their own limits...&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the next step of developing the theory Maturana tries
to show that this is not only a scientific theory of knowledge - it is
a general science of knowing. He now uses this theory of knowledge obtained
by thinking within a biological frame in a reflexive manner, to make a
general philosophy: a self-organizing and self-sufficient epistemology
with no need to refer to an objective existing world of ideas and theories:
the autopoietic epistemology. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The argumentation is as follows. When we realize that
there is no objective reality for any autopoietic (biological) system,
then there is no objective reality for us - or science - either. There
are no autopoietic systems without an observer who &quot;brings them forth&quot;.
This means that there is no objective reality that can legitimize our claims
to truth. The universe is a multiverse (Maturana and Varela l987, Maturana
1988). Together, through languaging and social practice we bring forth
our worlds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I find that his theory gives a better foundation for Bateson's
theory of information through the important point that the autopoietic
system does not receive information but only perturbations of its organization.
The so called reaction is internal adjustments to preserve the internal
organization of the system. It underlines the distinction between the world
and its being of differences - potential information if you like - and
information processing of the autopoietic systems. In fact neither Maturana
or Varela like to use the concept of information.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>The limits of &quot;bring-forth-ism&quot;.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Krippendorff (1991) mentions the many different kinds
of constructivism flourishing within second-order-cybernetics, and mentions
Maturana and Varela's &quot;bring-forth-ism&quot; as one of them. Without
choosing any of them he sums up the essential goal of second order cybernetics
and constructivism:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The task of constructivism, as I see it, is <B>to
describe a system's operation within its own domain of description</B>
and <B>account for the constitution of its identity </B>and <B>the conditions
of its continued persistence in its own terms</B>. Said differently, constructivists
need to find a way of <B>putting the knower into a known that is constructed
so as to keep the knower viable in practice.</B>&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To accomplish that would - as Nagel (1986, s.74) points
out - be an important step forward in objectivity:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;We tend to use our rational capacities to construct
theories, without at the same time constructing epistemological accounts
of how those capacities work. Nevertheless, this is an important part of
objectivity.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is clear that Maturana and many cybernetic constructivists
have good arguments against physicalism. But when Maturana writes and talks
about the autopoietic system and the domain its organizational closure
creates - and underlines the general point that there are no autopoietic
systems without an observer to distinguish them - then he seems to be in
a pure phenomenalistic and solipsistic position. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Behind this position lies, however, the basic problem,
that one can't talk about reality in itself. It makes no sense to talk
about reality without being able to have access to the operations which
bring forth this result (Maturana 1990). In other words it is illusory
to talk about reality because each of us will assume we know what the other
means. But it is an assumption only. We are safer not to talk about reality
at all. It is more scientific not to talk about autopoietic systems when
there is no observer. This understanding gives a much softer version of
Maturana's basic epistemology . </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Talking of languaging as a kind of co-evolution between
two or more autopoietic systems stabilizing a common domain of distinction
of distinctions, he seems to adhere to some kind of social constructivism,
which is the general trend among the second order cyberneticians because
most of them deal with social systems, without being primarily interested
in natural phenomena. But that will not explain the very rigid and narrow
constrains physical things put on our constructions, and Maturana (1988)
is aware of the thermodynamic conditions for existence of living beings.
That again leaves us with Maturana's fundamental question of the relation
between the observer and the observed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The problem is that where &quot;bring-forth-ism&quot;
and constructivism seems to reveal something important about the relativity
of social concepts, belief-systems and institutions it is very difficult
to reconcile with the experience of material things. They seem to force
themselves upon us with independent necessity no matter how we choose to
perceive them or ignore them. It was well founded that the concept of 'things'
was so central to the philosophy of Aristotle. Only in mystical (and magical-occult)
traditions we have theories on how to change things through mental operations
alone and claims that it has been done. This is clearly not what Maturana
has in mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the other hand there seems to be a great problem in
establishing the same kind of independent reality in the sub-atomic worlds
of quantum mechanics (uncertainty principle, Bohr's theory of complementarity,
EPR-paradox etc.). Although we have gained knowledge about some of the
organizing patterns in the natural macro world, we seem forced to recognize
that the knowledge we get in experiments -especially in the realm where
the quantum effects are of significant importance - is not a picture of
material mechanisms working independently of our doing. The concepts of
particle, wave and field seem to have intermingled in such a way, that
they obscure our previous vision of the elementary particles as the material
building block of nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So it seems to be fruitful to accept <B>a great deal of
independent reality</B> to &quot;things&quot; including living &quot;things&quot;
and living languaging &quot;things&quot; as a part of the basic distinctions
which are prerequisites of the human knowing on which science is built.
The other prerequisite for science is languaging and thereby the existence
of <B>conscious</B> beings as ourselves. So to accept that the scientific
endeavour in fact gives us intersubjective knowledge of survival value,
we have to accept that the languaging living &quot;things&quot; are conscious
minds existing relatively independent of our own. As von Foerster (1980)
points out this is a basic epistemological choice, but it is fundamental
for the game called science. Maturana (1988) seems to recognize this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But the question still remains with us: how can we catch
anything &quot;out there&quot; of some general value if there are no mechanisms,
no structures and no things to be uncovered, and if our concepts are purely
social constructs? It is important to remember that this kind of question
takes precedence of <B>scientific</B> theory of evolution and natural selection.
There seems to be an unavoidable philosophical obligation to say at least
something more of the world than to characterize it as a multiverse, if
one wants to do a fair job in putting forth a view in philosophy of science.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This bring us to the second shortcoming of Bateson's attempt
to build a theory of information and knowing. As with Maturana he has problems
with his world view. But they are of another kind. The problem is his attempt
to raise his theory on the foundation of a unification between thermodynamics
and information theory.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Information and negative entropy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In &quot;Mind and Nature&quot; (1980 p.103) Bateson further
develops his criteria for a cybernetic definition of mind:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;1.<I>A mind is an aggregate of interacting parts
or components.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2.<I>The interaction between parts of mind is triggered
by difference,</I> and difference is a nonsubstantial phenomenon not loca-ted
in space or time; difference is related to negentropy and entropy rather
than to energy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3.<I>Mental process requires collateral ener-gy.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>4.<I>Mental process requires circular (or more complex)
chains of determination.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>5.<I>In mental process, the effects of difference are
to be regarded as transforms (i.e. coded versions) of events preceding
them</I>. The rules of such transformation must be comparatively stable
(i.e. more stable than the content) but are themselves subject to transformation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>6.<I>The description and classification of these processes
of transformation disclose a hierarchy of logical types immanent in the
phenomena.</I>&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>These criteria are all famous within cybernetic understanding
of mind, and I will not discuss them further here. My critique is concentrated
on the foundation of the second criteria: &quot;difference is related to
negentropy and entropy...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is problematic, that Bateson is following Norbert Wiener's
idea of a basic community between thermodynamics and Shannon and Weaver's
theory of information based upon a shared starting point in the concept
of entropy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Regarding the problem of the relation between the concept
&quot;information&quot; and the concept &quot;negative entropy&quot;. Bateson
writes (Ruesch &amp; Bateson 1968, p. 177):</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Wiener argued that these two concepts are synonymous;
and this statement, in the opinion of the writers, marks the greatest single
shift in human thinking since the days of Plato and Aristotle, because
it unites the natural and the social sciences and finally resolves the
problems of teleology and the body-mind dichotomy which Occidental thought
has inherited from classical Athens&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>However, Shannon's theory of information has never had
anything to do with the semantic content of messages. Shannon and Weaver
(1969 p.31-32 ) write:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that
of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected
at another point. Frequently the messages have <B>meaning</B>; that is
they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical
or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant
to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that they are <B>selected
from a set</B> of possible messages.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So, what people and animals conceive as information is
something quite different from what Shannon and Weaver's theory of information
is about. As von Foerster (1980 p. 20-21) concludes:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;However, when we look more closely at these theories,
it becomes transparently clear that they are not really concerned with
information but rather with signals and the reliable transmission of signals
over unreliable channels ...&quot; </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a conclusive analysis summing up many years of work
with the concept of information in the physical sciences and information
theory Voetmann Christiansen (1984) points out, that it is in fact a materialistic
reductionism to claim that one's theory of information is based upon the
physical concept of entropy:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;....in as much as the intentional aspect of entropy
is its meaninglessness and uselessness. The measure for information which
was introduced by C. Shannon and N. Wiener, among others, is also in the
theory of information designated &quot;entropy&quot;, as it formally is
identical with the measure of entropy in statistical mechanics. One attempts
in the theory of information to get out of the oddity of entropy in physics
being a measure for missing information about the distribution of energy
among the degrees of freedom by placing a minus sign in front of the entropy
measure. &quot;Information&quot; is de-fined as &quot;negative entropy&quot;
(negentropy): i.e. information theory's message to us can be summarized
in the following manner: &quot;You must not at first be interested in meaning,
but you will learn to measure the meaningless in a precise way. This way
one can always learn to understand meaning afterward by changing signs
for meaninglessness&quot;. </FONT></P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>(Voetmann Christiansen 1984)</FONT></P></DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>According to Voetmann Christiansen, Bateson's theory would
appear to end in a materialistic short-circuit. It is also well known that
to determine the entropy in a system it is necessary in advance to determine
what will count as macrostates. Further it is necessary to determine the
probability of every state in advance. There is no room for the complete
unexpected. But as Bateson's original definition goes, it is the observing
system that determines which differences make a difference as it goes along
in its historical drift. We are then back to the problem about which basic
assumption we have to make about the world/reality and the relation between
the observer and the world - including the theory of evolution - to &quot;...find
a way of <B>putting the knower into a known that is constructed so as to
keep the knower viable in practice</B>&quot; as Krippendorff has stated.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>How can we create a viewpoint which is neither physicalistic
nor an idealistic form of con-structivism? How can we make a - non-re-ductionistic
- foundation for second-order cybernetics which is compatible with our
knowledge in the sciences as well as in the humanities and in the social
sciences, and do not fall into any of the known traps of our tradition
of philosophy? I do think that Maturana is well under way. But I think
it is possible to create a bit more clarity by analyzing the foundation
of physics and especially its use of the concepts of entropy and chaos.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>The problem of order and chance in physics</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The concept of entropy was introduced by Claudius around
1865 as an expression of the dissipation of energy as heat into the many
degrees of freedom of the movements of the molecules in the surrounding
space in such a way that it cannot be recovered again to perform the work
from which the concept of energy was originally defined. In other words,
a degradation of energy had occurred. Only the so-called free energy could
be used to do productive work. Based on his reflections, Claudius then
advanced the two famous dicta of thermodynamics:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. The total amount of energy in the world is constant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. Entropy seeks a maximum.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In this way - in opposition to the mechanical idea of
particles, whose movements are determined by deterministic, mathematically
describ-able and time- reversible laws - a time direction and thus evolution
in physics was introduced.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Soon, however, it turned out that there are divergent
views on the epistemological status of thermodynamics and, consequently,
the physical concept of entropy. Can thermodynamics be reduced, in principle,
to classical mechanics? or is it a science - irreducible in principle -
so fundamental that the inclusion of mechanics is an intrinsic part of
it? The cardinal point in a century-long discussion is the question about
the ontological status of the concept of randomness in physics. Thermodynamics
seems to break fundamentally with the determinism and time reversibility
of mechanics by being a basically statistical theory. Indeed in classical
mechanics the direction of time is not a significant parameter, whereas
&quot;the arrow of time&quot; is introduced in and with thermodynamics
- if one accepts its fundamental status. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At precisely this point Prigogine and Stengers (1984)
intervene with a reflective argument. They indicate that evolution, life,
and therefore the conscious of mankind is not possible without the increasing
entropy of irreversibility and thereby an increase of objective randomness.
If one now insists that this randomness is not objective but only an expression
of our limited knowledge - well, one is in reality insisting that our physical
bodies are merely products of our own ignorance!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Notice how closely the mechanical paradigm is connected
to the idea of objective materialistic information. Laplace's demon succinctly
expres-ses the idea that the world consists of a mathematically-describable,
completely exhaustible information. If it had knowledge of the position,
speed, direction, mass and acceleration of all the &quot;particles&quot;,
it could compute all the events of the past and the course of the entire
future. If this mechanistic world view were true, then reality would be
full of objective information waiting &quot;out there&quot; independent
of any observer. As Stonier (1990) for example thinks:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;<B>In the present work</B>, and it is crucial to
the entire analysis, <B>information is consi-dered to be distinct from
the system which interprets, or some other way processes, such information.</B>&quot;
(p.18)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;<B>Information exists.</B> It does not need to be<B>
perceived </B>to exists. It requires no intelligence to interpret it. It
does not have to have<B> meaning </B>to exist. It exists.&quot; (p.21)</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But in the further development of thermodynamics Boltzmann
had to give up the idea of a basic simple objective order between the movements
of particles to make comprehensible the thermodynamic evolution towards
states of equilibrium. The idea is that it is impossible to initiate the
description by noting every single position, speed, etc. when dealing with
large populations (ensembles) of particles. It is therefore unrealistic
to construct a classical mechanical calculation on this basis. Out of this
molecular chaos one is on the other hand able to define a mathematical
density function in phase space. The mathematical model which emerged from
this work represented a considerable scientifically advance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Boltzmann introduced probability as a basic concept in
order to explain how systems consisting of large populations of particles
eventually &quot;settle&quot; in stationary conditions in which the mixture
of the elements is most random. This state is called thermodynamic equilibrium.
It functions as a general attractor. In other words, if a liquid containing
white and blue particles is mixed, the most probable state of rest is not
blue particles in one side of the glass and white particles in the other,
but a more random mixture with a light blue color. The system has &quot;forgotten&quot;
its original state. Boltzmann's principle of order asserts that the system
seeks the state in which a large number of events occur simultaneously
- statistically speaking - cancelling each other. Entropy increases because
probability increases!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The important point is, that Boltzmann's principle of
order is based upon the assumption that molecules behave independently
of each other before they mix and collide. This state is called &quot;molecular
chaos&quot; and it was in fact a manifestation of the abandonment of Laplace's
deter-minism and Leibniz' &quot;prestabilized harmony&quot;, both based
upon an idealistic assumption that the attainment of total knowledge of
every single &quot;particle&quot; is possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The more general modern pragmatic view of physics sees
classical deterministic mechanicism and the use of its paradigm in quantum
mechanics as an idealistic view of the world which has given us some very
useful models for calculation of certain types of systems. But it is not
the basic model of &quot;reality&quot;. As Prigogine points out we must
accept randomness as a basic property in the physical world, and not just
as a result of simple ignorance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>From this point of view Voetmann Christiansen (1970, 1975)
shows the impossibility of establishing a materialistic concept of information
by pointing out the impossibility of registering all the connections in
a given field of measurements. In the thermodynamic chaos of the micro
world there is actually an infinite and unattainable mass of potential
information because the microscopic variables are so numerous (magnitude
about 10 to the power of 23) that it must be supposed an impossibility
in principle for man to achieve more than an infinitesimal fraction of
the information necessary to plot the values which determine the Brownian
movements of the molecules.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Voetmann Christiansen shows that the starting point for
the concept of information must be phenomenological, but still within a
realistic - but not mechanistic - world view. And on this basis Bateson's
definition of information as a difference which makes a difference is still
valid. Information is what you get in reply to a question. One defines
the question's limits and area of measurement, and from these one can connect
hypothetical probability values. One must then from this point work towards
the sole form of objectivity that is given ordinary people: intersubjectivity.
The chaos of thermodynamic microcosms can be characterized as objective
ignorance in as much as the amount of energy and time which must be expended
in the attempt to attain complete knowledge about it would create such
massive amounts of entropy that the world would be considerably altered
before the project was well under way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But is this not a reflective trap? Won't our argument
for a logical connection between chaos, irreversibility, time and evolution
lead us to the claim that man as an evolutionary product is the result
of this physics-determined chaos? This is still the most common way to
comprehend the neo-Darwinist theory of evolution, which is basic to the
science of biology. Somehow, scientists and philosophers imagine, life
and consciousness emerge out of the physical universe. Non-equilibrium
thermodynamics, dissipative structures and self-organization are evoked
as explanations - also among many second order cyberneticians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Von Foerster is well aware of the problem. He writes:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;... I propose to continue the use of the term &quot;self-organizing
system,&quot; whilst being aware of the fact that this term becomes meaningless,
unless the system is in close contact with an environment, <B>which possesses
available energy and order</B>, and with which our system is in a state
of perpetual interaction, such that it somehow manages to &quot;live&quot;
on the expenses of this environment.&quot;(von Foerster 1984 p.4)</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Later in the same paper he goes on:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;... to show that there is some structure in our
environment..., by pointing out that we are obviously not in the dreadful
state of Boltzmann's &quot;Heat Death&quot;. Hence presently still the
entropy increases, which means that there must be some order - at least
now - otherwise we could not loose it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Let me briefly summarize the points I have made until
now:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(1)By a self-organizing system I mean that part of a system
that eats energy and order from its environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(2)There is a reality of the environment in a sense suggested
by the acceptance of the principle of relativity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(3)The environment has structure.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>(von Foerster 1984 p.8)</FONT></P></DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We must accept some kind of structure of the world/reality.
But physical structure alone won't do it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is not difficult to point out the inconsistence in
attempting to account for human consciousness in terms of physical determinism
(which we have already dismissed). One cannot be a determinist because
it is a true philosophy, but only because one is predestined by the physical
chain of causes and effects. But in this way these views loose their logical
and truth dimensions which are a pre-requisite in the analysis of the views.
Not only do they claim to be in accordance with the physical sciences,
but they also claim to be logically valid and true. And that is something
fundamentally different, which requires consciousness and knowing - and
those were the things we set out to explain!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The questions of origin, the nature of reality and how
to know it are logically necessary in their form but impossible to give
an explicit and final symbolic answer. It seems always to end in self-circularity
and paradox. This insight is basic to second-order cybernetics (see for
instance von Foerster 1990). But by asking these questions we can delimit
some of the premises for the possibility of raising these questions at
all. A total paradox-free self-reflection does not seem to be possible
in language without incorporating some kind of falsehood as is shown for
example in G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem for mathematics. There will
always be indecidables. In von Foerster's (1992) view this is where ethics
and aesthetics come in.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We have some knowledge, and we know that we can obtain
more. But we must admit that we do not have universal knowledge neither
in the physical sciences nor in philosophy. Human knowledge is the meeting
point between the subjective (autopoietic) and the objective (partly independent
reality) and so it is relational and prone to mistakes. It is an ongoing
process. It is human knowing. Information always has a historical index.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We strive for universal knowledge. At least it is part
of the ideal of philosofy and science. But the fact is that our knowledge
is always contextual, and therefore limited to a part of reality. We are
not even able to give a simple description of the limits of the truth-content
in our knowledge (models, theories) in any absolute theoretical way before
the practical testing and the attempts of falsification. To use a modern
image: the border between the areas in which a given model makes true and
untrue statements is not a smooth curve but seems rather to be a fractal
one. Science probes, it does not prove, says Bateson.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So when we try to generalize knowledge it is always prone
to failure. This is intrinsic to what we call human knowing. But if we
not able to recognize when we are mistaken, our knowledge could not grow.
It is through our original ability to make distinctions in particular matters
that we are able - by way of logic - to falsify our general models.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is not only the so-called &quot;outside&quot; world
that persists in surprising us with its complexity and spontaneity, it
is also our so-called &quot;inner&quot; world, the &quot;subconscious&quot;
complexity and spontaneity behind our acting in the world including languaging
(as Maturana calls it to underline a process we are in rather than the
conscious instrumental use of language). This basic incompleteness in our
knowledge of our-selves, the reasons for our acting and lack of absolute
conscious control over speech are a the same time the prerequisite for
our ability to say something new and to cognize something new; to be in
our basic flow of knowing and languaging. To realize that is not the end
but the beginning of science, or rather of second-order-science.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But in relation to the indeterministic view one could
furthermore ask how this world can exist at all and how scientific gathering
of invariances is possible if the fundamental nature of reality is objective
chance. If the world is governed by chance, how can any form of structure
and law exist? The solution can only be found in a world view on a higher
level, above determinism and indeterminism. One that does not contradict
determinism in terms of the world of experience, but which turns it into
a partial feature of a more extensive total point of view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the last part of this paper I will analyze such a candidate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>Living chaos as a basic concept in a theory of information</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A possible solution to this paradox is given by C. S.
Peirce (1891,1892). Peirce points out that randomness or chaos must necessarily
come before lawfulness and determination in an evolutionary philosophy!
In accordance with the above-mentioned analysis by Voetmann Christiansen
regarding information defined as negentropy, Peirce makes it clear that
one cannot in a positive way base chance on the physical concept of laws
- but only on a purely negative definition such as absence of law or absence
of knowledge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But Peirce (1892B) - in opposition to most modern scientists,
among them Prigogine - then very clearly sees that his concept of chaos
then cannot be limited to the mechanistic concepts of a dead and mechanical
world. You cannot in advance - so to say - remove life and mind from the
basic undifferentiated chaos from which worlds are initiated. The fundamental
chaos is not the absence of law, it is the mother of law. It is not only
empty, it is also full of possibilities. It is not only &quot;dead&quot;,
it is also full of life and mind, and then Peirce coins a concept to explain
at the same time evolution and regularities of nature. He writes, that
it has a tendency to be habit forming. Peirce therefore boldly calls it
<B>pure spontaneity</B>! It is the spontaneity of living feeling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One can determine law from chance, i.e., as 'habits'.
&quot;The laws of nature are the habits of the cosmos&quot;, says Peirce.
The laws of nature we find are exact only in their mathematical descriptions,
whereas the measurements on which they are based are always vitiated by
uncertainties. The laws are only approximate model descriptions of a far
richer and more varied, spontaneous and living reality. Peirce writes (1892):</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;To undertake to account for anything by saying boldly
that it is due to pure chance would indeed be futile. But this I do not
do. I make use of chance chiefly to make room for a principle of generalization,
or tendency to form habits, which I hold has produced all regularities.
The mechanical philosopher leaves the whole specification of the world
unaccounted for, which is pretty near as bad as boldly attribute it to
chance. I attribute it altogether to chance it is true, but to chance in
a form of spontaneity which is to some degree regular&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In order to impart meaning to this philosophy we must
view chaos as spontaneously dynamic with a tendency to form habits. Symmetry
breaking is a more modern scientific concept for the same phenomenon which
is used in both quantum field physics and in thermodynamics. If we are
going to accept chaos as a concept as fundamental as the concept of natural
law, then we should not conceive of chaos as the absence of regularity
or the absence of the ability to create structures. It should be viewed,
rather, like all possibilities, as a hyper-complexity of potential structure
and potential information in a living, infinite dynamics. It could thus
be possible to transcend the dilemma between determinism and indeterminism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Peirce's argument now is that if chaos is the fundamental
concept then law is the unusual, unexpected thing, and thereby the thing
to explain. It is not the other way around. From the point of view of the
statistical information of Shannon and Weawer there is maximal information
in chaotic random behavior. But not so with Peirce. Here it is the departures
from the random which are interesting, which gives us information on structures
and lawlike behavior (the habits of matter as Peirce calls them). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Talking of law coming from the random, Cosmos coming from
Chaos, the habits of the universe coming into being, then the creation
of the World and our own world melts together in a way; which the new cybernetics
and constructivism has for a long time been on the track, for instance
with Maturana and Varela's concept of autopoiesis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>As Peirce has noted, it is necessary to transcend the
fruitless antagonism between idealism and materialism. Mechanism is what
exorcises the spirit from nature and converts it into a machine. As soon
as one perceives that deterministic mechanics has no ontological status,
one sees that this presupposition about reality is not justifiable, and
the way is paved for a more comprehensive view. About this, Peirce writes
(1892 a, p. 335):</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;On the other hand, by supposing the rigid exactitude
of causation to yield, I care not how little it be but an strictly infinitesimal
amount - we gain room to insert mind into our scheme, and put it in the
place where it is needed, into the position which, as the sole self-intelligible
thing, it is entitled to occupy, that of the fountain of existence; and
in so doing we resolve the problem of the connection of soul and body&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The latter statement is perhaps a bit extravagant but
it is true that we long ago had to accept that a stimulus-response theory
of learning within the framework of a mechanistic ontology would not aid
us significantly in understanding what knowledge is and how it is at all
possible. Since Descartes, the dualistic philosophy of mechanism has driven
the spirit from the world and the world from the spirit and, as a result,
encountered the most fearful problems in attempting to reunite them through
knowledge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I think that Peirce provides us with a basic world view
which can unite a form of realism with Maturana and Varela's biologically
inspired concept of autopoiesis and the theory of the social construction
of knowledge. Creating what I would call a conscious myth in that we explicate
the prerequisites necessary to explain the abilities and knowledge we actually
have. Peirce realizes, that such an ontology must include a view of the
&quot;creation of the world&quot;, which is not in conflict with our present
scientific knowledge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Peirce (1891, p. 170) describes a possible model of the
creation of world and order in the following way:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;It would suppose that in the beginning, - infinitely
remote, - there was a chaos of unpersonalized feeling, which being without
connection or regularity would properly be without existence. This feeling,
sporting here and there in pure arbitrariness, would have started the germ
of a generalizing tendency. Its other sportings would be evanescent, but
this would have a growing virtue. Thus, the tendency to habit would be
started; and from this with the other principles of evolution all the regularities
of the universe would be evolved. At any time, however, an element of pure
chance survives and will remain until the world becomes an absolutely perfect,
rational, and symmetrical system, in which mind is at last crystallized
in the infinitely distant future&quot;.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This statement is very much in agrement with Einstein's
theory of general relativity, where the Universe is seen as the unfolding
of space-time. In modern physical cosmology - the Big Bang theory and the
superstring theory - the universe is seen as arising from a random sporting
from the vacuum field. It is very small in the beginning but rapidly it
expands and thereby unfolds space-time. The difference is, that most modern
physicists believe that chaos is non-living and non-mental. They have a
physicalistic world view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Peirce solution to Maturana's problem of the world's existence
before and partly independent of the observer is a unique variation of
the objective idealistic position, which is - as far as I can see - the
only position that can support Maturana's philosophy that there is no system
without an observer. Peirce (1891, see Buchler 1955 p.322) writes:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The only intelligible theory of the universe is
that of objective idealism, that matter is effete mind, inveterate habits
becoming physical laws&quot;. </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On p.321 he explains a little more:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The law of habit exhibits a striking contrast to
all physical laws in the character of its commands. A physical law is absolute.
What it requires is an exact relation. Thus, a physical force introduces
into a motion a component motion to be combined with the rest by the parallelogram
of forces; but the component motion must actually take place exactly as
required by the law of force. On the other hand, no exact conformity is
required by the mental law. Nay, exact conformity would be in downright
conflict with the law; since it would instantly crystallize thought and
prevent all further formation of habit. The law of mind only makes a given
feeling <I>more likely</I> to arise. It thus resembles the &quot;non-conservative&quot;
forces of physics, such as viscosity and the like, which are due to statistical
uniformities in the chance encounters of trillions of molecules.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The old dualistic notion of mind and matter, so prominent
in Cartesianism, as two radically different kinds of substance, will hardly
find defenders to-day. Rejecting this, we are driven to some form of hylopathy,
otherwise called monism.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>From this position he goes on to develop the theory into
the realm of semiotics and knowing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Voetmann Christiansen (1970, pp. 1-15) is on the same
line of thought in his discussion of how one can meaningfully conceptualize
the connection between the information-theoretical entropy concept H and
the thermodynamic entropy concept S avoiding to base them upon the negatively
determined concept of chaos of mechanics:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;H and S represent in reality exactly the same thing
- that is, &quot;missing&quot; information, i.e., information not received
but awaited when we have undertaken measurements. To avoid confusion over
concepts such as negative information and negative entropy, it would be
preferable to say the &quot;missing information&quot; means subconscious
or preconscious information. Information is always positive, be it conscious
or unconscious. The concept of &quot;negentropy&quot; is science's defense
against the inclusion of consciousness in the description of nature...&quot;
</FONT></P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>(Christiansen 1970, p. 1-15)</FONT></P></DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I believe that in this way it is possible to outline a
consistent and meaningful foundation for Bateson's concept of information.
It will not only make possible the inclusion of the entire range of Peirce's
semiotic reflections, but it could also be reconciled with the important
further developments of Bateson's modes of thought which have been made
by Maturana and Varela.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Conclusions</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I agree with Bateson (1973) that we have to start our
understanding of information with the process of knowing. I think that
Bateson's definition of information as a difference which makes a difference
is very fruitful. His problem is that he nearly makes every cybernetic
system a communicator and a knower.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Seen from this way of formulating the problem, the main
achievement of the work of Maturana (1983, 1988) and Maturana and Varela
(1987) is that they have conceptualized the basic requirements for a system
to be living and knowing, in short to posses mind: it has to be autopoietic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>They underline an important aspect of Bateson's theory
of information when they stress that the autopoietic system does not receive
information but only perturbations of its organization. The so-called reaction
is internal adjustments to preserve the internal organization of the system.
It underlines the distinction between the world and its being of differences
- potential information if you like - and information processing of the
autopoietic systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Maturana's theory of autopoiesis and knowing is clearly
not physicalistic. But on the other hand he says so little of the world
and the problems of independent structures in it, that it almost seems
as if the observers create the physical world totally by themselves, although
this is not his view. There still seems to be a philosophical gab in the
theoretical foundations of second-order-cybernetics, or at least its for-mulations,
with which cyberneticians has to deal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In his creation of a basic semiotic Peirce did some very
fundamental thinking about the necessary relationship between the interpreter,
the sign and the object and the minimum qualities he had to ascribe to
them to make a realistic model of the process of knowing and sign making.
I have not focused on his doctrine of sign in itself in this paper. My
main focus has been on its epistemological and ontological foundations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In accordance with modern thermodynamics - but not built
on it - Peirce sees the basic quality of reality as randomness or chaos.
He then clearly sees, that if chaos is basic then you cannot explain it
as the absence of law, because chance or randomness is before law. So you
have to explain law from randomness, not the other way around. Chaos, chance,
randomness must then be seen not only as emptiness but also as fullness,
i.e. as a hypercomplex dynamic process, which includes the characteristics
of mind, matter and life. He calls it pure spontaneity, and living feeling,
somewhat mystically inspired. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To explain how law and structure comes from randomness
Peirce finds it necessary to endow chaos with one more quality, namely
the tendency to form habits. Evolution of order - emergence - demands a
projection of the quality of the tendency to form habits into the world
substratum. In this minimum statement he avoids saying too much about a
virtual order in the transcendental and on the other hand he avoids denying
such an order. Furthermore he does not start with an elimination of mind,
living and knowing from reality. Thereby he avoids to have to reinvent
them later on by &quot;changing signs for meaninglessness&quot;. In this
way he creates a fruitful non-reductionistic philosophical foundation (world
view) for the theories of Bateson and Maturana, and more generally speaking
for second-order cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We cannot say that the world we live in has no structures,
on the other hand we cannot say that our process of knowing has no influence
on these structures. We cannot say that the world is basically logical
and determinate or that it is absolute irrational and chaotic. We cannot
say that reality is basically simple (and logic) or that it is too complex
to be even partly understood. We cannot say that reality is basically &quot;dead&quot;
material or that it is basically &quot;pure spirit&quot;. Our theory of
knowledge/of knowing must be based somewhere between these positions. I
therefore think that Peirce's theory of basic reality as a hypercomplexity
of living feeling with a tendency to form habits, is a good and fruitful
supplement (or vice versa) to Bateson's and Maturana's theories of information,
communication, knowing and languaging. I see here a fruitful theoretical
connection between second order cybernetics and semiotics which will give
both theories more strength. How that is to be done in specific areas and
practices must be dealt with in further development within these areas
in an exchange between the general theory and the specific area or practice.</FONT></P>

Maturana (1988) insist that what he does is science. But in the usual way
of using the word what they do is philosophy. There is both an epistemology
(and within that a philosophy of science), a world view and an ethics in
their writings.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>There is no logical necessity here between biology and
philosophy. The broadening of the theory is the result of what Maturana
- when asked - calls historical drift (Maturana 1990). It is with thought
as with language, that we have no final causal control over where it will
lead us. But still in their writings their is a lot of arguing from a biological
scientific level of thought to a more general philosophical level (see
Maturana 1988).</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Thanks to Hugh Gash for a helpful critique of my viewpoints
on Maturana's work.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The notion of the amount of information attaches
itself very naturally to a classical notion in statistical mechanics. That
of <B>entropy</B>. Just as the amount of information in a system is a measure
of its degree of organization, so the entropy of a system is a measure
of its degree of disorganization; and the one is simply the negative of
the other.&quot; (Wiener 1961 p.11)</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>This might be true on a spiritual level. But the present
claim is in the context of objective science.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>I am using the concept &quot;particle&quot; as a general
theoretical concept encompassing molecules, atoms and sub-atomic &quot;particles&quot;
(and which in reality is used also &quot;upward&quot; in the scientific
hierarchy when one limits the units as passive and independent in stimulus-response
psychology and in sociology, among others). The essential point is that
the discussion is relevant on all levels, especially physics and chemistry.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>We do not deal with Prigogine's controversial theory
of micro-entropy in this context.</FONT></LI>
