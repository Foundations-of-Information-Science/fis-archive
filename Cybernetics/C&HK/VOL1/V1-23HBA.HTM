<I>Activity Theory and Radical Constructivism - What do they have in common,
and how do they differ?</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>Related to the interpretative needs of qualitative empirical investigation
a short account and comparison of Radical Constructivist and Activity Theory
approaches is offered. The two competing models for human epistemology
seem to be very near in their accentuation of the importance of human action
and its constructive nature, the role of adaptative processes for learning
and the function of social interaction. A closer look albeit reveals certain
contradictions, in particular when extrapolations for the orientation of
education and innovation are drawn. </P>
