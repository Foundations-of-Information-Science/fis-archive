<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>How can we understand and account for the often striking differences
in the meanings made and the realities found by another when we are confronted
with what might seem to be the &quot;same&quot; phenomena? Focusing on
musical phenomena, I argue first, that a hearing is a performance, and
then ask: what are specific differences in the hearings individuals actually
make in listening to the same piece of music, and what can we take as evidence
for such differences? Arguing further, that because it is considered professionally
correct to report only the neat and clean results of research without making
the reader privy to the circumstances that led to the questioning of basic
assumptions or to the subsequent invention of novel experimental designs,
readers are left with only the possibility to assimilate new ideas to the
still unquestioned assumptions that they hold already. To confront these
issues directly, I describe how and why I came to question assumptions
hidden in the initial interpretation of my own research findings, and then
ask readers to live through this process themselves, by following a dialogue
between two students and myself as we experience the confusions and surprises
involved in coming to hear even simple rhythms in new ways. </P>
