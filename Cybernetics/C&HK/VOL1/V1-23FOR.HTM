<H3>FOREWORD</H3>

<P>S&oslash;ren Brier</P>

<P>In this double issue of Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing we have collected
articles on teaching seen from different constructivist positions by Heinrich
Bauersfeld, John Frode Blichfeldt. Related to that we have two articles
on the cognition and performance of music in the self-organizing relations
between hearings, notations and practices by Jean Bamberger and Tellef
Kvifte. Behind these discussions are the questions of the relation between
cognition, information and reality which are discussed in a paper by S&oslash;ren
Brier.</P>

<P>We continue to bring papers which introduce to cybernetics on a high
level. The former president of the ASC, Fred Steier, who has made a big
effort to make this journal possible writes among other things about the
relation and differences between system science and second order cybernetics.
We also reprint Rodney Donaldson's Prolegomenon because illness and some
unfortunate events resulted in fallouts of important words and a sentence
in his short paper. </P>

<P>The paper from practice is written by Per Thygesen Poulsen from the
Academy of Practical Philosophy. He writes about how second order cybernetics
is fruitful in understanding management and organizational problems.</P>

<P>The artists of this issue are Eli Ponsain in corporation with the crystallization
process of a special photographic developer which organizes itself in the
most astonishing &quot;intelligent&quot; forms. In this process seeing
and creating are intimately connected. Poul Erik T&oslash;jner writes about
his art.</P>

<P>In the name of self-organization our policy is that we offer the journal
as an international exhibition for artists whose art in some way relates
to cybernetic themes. We offer the artist and the readers the possibility
respectively to sell and buy the exhibited pieces. And we welcome short
papers on the relation between the artistic expressions and cybernetics.
Interested artists should send their material to the art editor Bruno Kj&aelig;r.</P>

<P>As the journal moves into its second year and volume we will welcome
guest editors on different themes within second order cybernetics. Suggestions
should be sent to the editor S&oslash;ren Brier.</P>

<P>Finally it is time to think of renewing your subscription if you want
to be sure to avoid delays in delivering. The last issue of this year will
be published in december. It is very important for the continuation of
the journal that we receive payment from the subscribers in advance.</P>

<P>As the american dollar has fallen considerably since the start of the
journal we have to put 10$ on the price of individual subscriptions and
20$ on institutional subscriptions to cover some of our losses. The price
outside Europe for individuals will be 60 US$ (or 340 danish kr.) and 110
US$ (or 620 danish kr.) for institutions including postage and handling
of currencies. We will ask all European subscribers to pay in danish kroner
from now on. As the postage now is lower here and we will not have to handle
foreign currencies the price in Europe outside the Nordic countries will
be 310 kr for individuals and 560 kr. for institutions. In the Nordic countries
the price will still be 250 kr. for individuals and 500 kr. for institutions.</P>
