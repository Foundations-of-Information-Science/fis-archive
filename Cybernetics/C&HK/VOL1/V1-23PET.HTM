<I>Natural Beauty - about Eli Ponsaing&acute;s chrystallograms</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It has become both the burden and the priviledge of art
in modernity on the one hand to confirm the split between nature and humanity,
on the other to contain a longing for reconciliation between these two
poles. The concept of a similarity between the forms of nature and the
forms of art manifested by the unity of the supreme good, truth and beauty
was wrecked in the end of the 18. century and this essentially gave birth
to modern art that never since really let the idea of a primordial unity
disappear. The avantgarde has always even in its most subjectivist forms
insisted on the epistemological power of art. From suprematism to abstract
expressionist painting art is connected with forces outside time and space
of the single work - and even in movements that insist emphatically on
the autonomy of art one finds in one sense or another the concept of the
work as an entrance to something great and unknown being within the reach
of the magic forces of art.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The kind of subjectivism that has characterized modernity
and especially modern art one could thus also describe as a prayer or plea
for contact with nature an sich, nature in itself. And nature understood
not as chaos but as order, as a both selfsufficient and comprehensive order
that might even function as a consolation to modern man's experience of
living abandoned in the shadow of a vacuum, threatened by total contingency.
August Strindberg, the world-famous Swedish writer and painter, worked
with and in this conflict and is hence the modern artist par excellence.
On the one hand he is part of the radical modernist movement which in the
end of the 19. century together with Nietzsche made any given order vanish
and sanctified man as his own sovereign. On the other hand he is sitting,
one summer in the middle of Europe, laying photosensitive paper out in
the night under the shining stars with the purpose of eliminating the human
mediation of natural order and beaty. He sees the photographic lenses almost
as symbols of the agonizing distance between humanity and nature and he
hopes to be able to represent without distorsion. Without mediation. Hopes
that photography can be replaced by the photogram - a less manipulated
representation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Now one thing is mediation as possible distorsion of natural
order, quite another matter is the question whether nature has such a thing
as order. In many ways Nietzsche's perspectivism has during the 20. century
and especially during the last decade been revised due to scientific research
and reflection. The concept of autopoietic processes has thus made parts
of science more edifying than art has ever dreamt of, namely by bringing
forth a new realism that might conceive cultural phenomena - language and
iconography for example -as isomorphic with what we normally categorize
as natural phenomena. So nature turns out to be the order that artist have
dreamt of during modernity. Or to put in other words: chaos is also order.
The opposition between chaos and order is not ontological, it is epistemological.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The danish artist Eli Ponsaing, born 1922 and professor
at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, has for many years worked
in this modern tension between nature and art, between world and work.
The word that points out the tension and at the same time marks the center
of his oeuvre is the word 'composition'. Composition is something else
than creation. Composition is intervention in or administration of something
given and thus confirms already on this conceptual level a relation between
the material of the work of art and its expressive gestures. One of the
most evident media concerning this relation is of course photography, and
Ponsaing has for many years in fact worked graphically with photography.
He has transformed for example apparently chaotic ruins into states of
compositional equilibrium and thereby pointed out both a potential order
in the world and the compositional eye not as invention but discovery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Recently, Ponsaing has narrowed his eye but only almost
magically to widen out the perspectives of his work. He has found a vertigous
beauty and order in processes of chrystallisation. The discovery in itself
is not new - man has for centuries been fascinated by chrystal phenomena
like ice flowers and snowflakes -, but Ponsaing has turned the discovery
into graphic works and hereby created an art that is both new and has the
above mentioned relations to the most intrinsic dreams of modern aesthetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>His graphic works are a result of photoengraving with
photopolymer-plates. Ponsaing produces a chrystallisation of a chemical
substance on transparent foil. He then transfers a chosen sector hereof
- normally not more than one square centimeter - to the sensitive photopolymer-plate
from which he finally can print. Ponsaing's interventions are partly compositional,
partly they relate to some kind of control with the proces of chrystallisation,
which for example depends on phenomena like temperature, time and gradient
of the foil during the proces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The result is surprising, thought-provoking and -beautiful.
Surprising because the chrystallisations reveal not only an order, but
also an order that we know from daily macrophysical experience. It is namely
in many ways the structure and form of plants that shows itself in Ponsaing's
graphic works. Leaves, branches, boughs, trees form a magic forest whose
perspective space takes us to the category which describes the essence
of the works: landscape. And this is thought-provoking because precisely
the concept of nature as landscape has had, during the history of art,
the function of reconciliation between humanity and nature. Even in its
sublime forms the effect and metaintention of landscape painting have always
been the producing of a place where man and nature can meet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Ponsaing's graphic worlds are such landscapes, where more
or less sensitive plants dramatize their growth between the organic order
of gemmation and the aggression of fire. Some of the works can thus be
ominous in their letting a world come forth, where spawn, weeds, and filth,
a leprous scum, has made the running rivulet thick and dumb, and at its
outlet flags huge as stakes and dammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes...
-- while other works give the mind the peace of meditation, the almost
empty concentration on the oscillation between repition and variation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Finally, Ponsaing's graphic works are beautiful both for
the thought and for the eye - in opposition to the fractals that until
now have only been producing kitsch. And precisely by speaking both to
thought and the eye Ponsaing's graphic works place themselves in another
aesthetic tradition which however has had the same purpose and intentions
as our landscape painting. It's the tradition of ornamental painting, the
tradition of ornament. Precisely ornament can be seen as a manifested boundary
between humanity and nature. A boundary however that is binding. When Kant
in his &quot;Kritik der Urteilskraft&quot; talked about art he just thought
of ornament and horticultural beauty - and modern art can in many ways
be related to kantian concepts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>With his graphic works, his chrystallograms, Eli Ponsaing
thus continues essential reflections on modern art and on the boundary
between art and science.</FONT></P>
