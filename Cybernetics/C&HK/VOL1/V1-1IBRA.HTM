<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Learning Cybernetics</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Steve Heims, a physicist turned historian of science,
explored two influential figures in early cybernetics in his excellent
book, <B>John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener</B> (MIT Press, 1980, 547
pp.). Now he has turned his attention to a wider group of cybernetic forebears,
those who gathered at the annual Macy conferences 1946 through 1953. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>The Cybernetics Group</B> (MIT Press, 1991, 334 pp.)
is as quirky and enjoyable a piece of science history as the previous book,
presenting in turns the intellectual biographies of the key people involved
(McCulloch, Mead, Bateson, Kubie, Savage, Frank and more) and the debates
at the conferences, as revealed through the extensive recorded proceedings.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Heims' interest is with science as a process occurring
through dialogue and group exchanges. Thus, in true cybernetic spirit,
he ends the book with a phrase, &quot;The conversation continues,&quot;
that mirrors the title of one forerunner of the present journal, the American
Society for Cybernetics newsletter &quot;Continuing the Conversation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Archival work of similar historical importance has been
performed by Rodney E. Donaldson, tender of the Bateson archives, who published
a collection of previously unpublished, little-known or hard-to-get papers
by Bateson: <B>A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind</B>.
A. Cornelia &amp; Michael Bessie Book. An Imprint of Harper Collins Publishers,
1991, pp. 364. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The younger Bateson, Mary Catherine, who recently enjoyed
bestseller status in the US with her multi-woman biography <B>Composing
a Life</B> (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1991), is reportedly at work on a manuscript
that develops her father's thinking on learning and adaptation. She argues
for an empathic and ethical way of knowing, according to which knowledge
arises out of action and participation in the world, rather than from the
detached position of the &quot;objective&quot; observer. Tentative title:
<B>Peripheral Visions: Learning Out of the Corner of Your Eye</B> (Harper
Collins, 1994?).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Complexity</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The next two years are going to see a handful of semi-popular
books on the science on complexity. All of them lean heavily on work done
at two New Mexico institutions that have dedicated themselves to the study
of complex, self-organizing phenomena, such as nerve cells in the brain,
genes in the genome, species in an ecosystem and consumers in an economy.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One institution is the Center for Non-Linear Studies at
the federally funded Los Alamos National Laboratories, the other is the
independent Santa Fe Institute (SFI). The former is a long-time leader
in the physics and computer-science aspects of systems with simple elements
and complex overall behavior, while the SFI is only half a dozen years
old and harbors broader, interdisciplinary ambitions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One of SFI's trustees is Murray Gell-Mann, Nobel-Prize
winning discoverer of the quark, who has since developed an interest in
the vagaries of complex systems. His 32-page proposal for a book on this
topic, <B>The Quark and the Jaguar</B>, was well handled by his New York
literary agent: within a few weeks it was sold to Bantam and over fifteen
foreign publishers, fetching advances at well over a million dollars (this
according to the trade magazine Publishers Weekly). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Judging by these amounts, which are right up there in
the stratosphere with Stephen King and Judith Krantz, this book is poised
to continue the mega-bucks bestseller tradition of Hawking's A <B>Brief
History of Time</B>, Gleick's <B>Chaos</B> and Penrose's <B>The Emperor's
New Mind</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Stuart Kauffman, a University of Pennsylvania biochemist
and sometime paricipant the Gordon conference on cybernetics, is a regular
at Santa Fe Institute seminars. Drawing on his experience there and his
own extensive research on genetic networks, he is under contract to write
a book titled <B>Complexity: The Discovery of Anti-Chaos</B>. Unlike the
semi-retired father figure Gell-Mann, who is promoting a field somewhat
alien to his training, the younger Kauffman is an active researcher in
the midst of things.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Two science writers have cast their eyes on complexity
research. <B>Complexity</B> is the title of a Macmillan publication by
Roger Lewin, whose previous books include <B>Bones of Contention</B> and,
with Richard Leaky, <B>Origins</B>. The forthcoming volume presents a story
in the manner of Gleick' <B>Chaos</B>, that is, a story of the people,
ideas and places that come togehter to make a new science. Presented are
Stephen Wolfram and cellular automata, Danny Hillis and the Connection
Machine, Manfred Eigen and life as a dynamic system, Kauffman's new Darwinism
and likely many more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The other journalistic account is by Kevin Kelly, hacker
organizer and editor of the Californian eco-techno magazine Whole Earth
Review (formerly Co-Evolution Quarterly). <B>Emergent Worlds: The Rise
of Artificial Evolution</B> examines the unintentional self-evolution of
organic and man-made systems, computer simulations, cybernetic worlds and
virtual realities -- such dreams as stuff in the 1990's is made of. The
book is due out in early 1993, from Addison-Wesley. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Lastly, rumor has it that Christopher Langton, a Los Alomos
biologist and computer expert, is at work on a book on Artificial Life
(AL), a research program he has helped launch by hosting conferences on
the topic. AL promises to do for biological order and evolution what Artificial
Intelligence promised (but failed) to do for the mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>While we wait for Langton to write his probably serious
treatment and some science journalist to elevate AL to the next New Science
in the making, a book by a Consulting Editor to the present journal, the
Danish biologist Claus Emmeche, seems to be the only popularly accessible
title on AL on market: <B>Det levende spil: Biologisk form og kunstigt
liv</B> (&quot;The Living Game: Biological form and AL&quot;) (Munksgaard,
Copenhagen; so far only available in Danish).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Neural Philosophy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The 1980's saw a surge of interest in neural networks,
the parallel computers modelled on the architecture of the nervous system.
Just as the conventional von Neumann-computer led countless researchers
and philosophers to ponder the von Neumann-like aspects of the mind, so
the neural computer is beginning to inspire serious reflection on the part
of philosophers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Patricia Smith Churchland, a current MacArthur Fellow
and professor at one of the major centers of cognitive science and neural
network research, University of California at San Diego, got off to an
early start in 1987 with her 550-page <B>Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified
Science of the Mind-Brain</B> (MIT Press). The book features a presentation
of elementary neuroscience, a review of functionalist philosophy of mind
and a sketchy 80-page section on &quot;A Neurophilosophical Perspective&quot;
that presents odds and ends from recent research in neural modelling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Since then, Churchland has prudently teamed up with a
neural network expert, Terrence Sejnowski, Director of the Salk Institute's
Computational Neurobiology Laboratory. Their book, <B>The Computational
Brain</B> (MIT Press, May 1992, 576 pp.) presents more neural network research
with a view to what is biologically relevant. The publisher's preview speaks
of a focus on visual perception, learning and memory, and sensory-motor
integration, while general principles applicable to other levels of neural
and mental organization are abstracted along the way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A promising-looking compilation of texts is the forthcoming
<B>The Philosophy of Mind: Classical Problems, Contemporary Issues</B>
(eds. Brian Beakley and Peter Ludlow, MIT Press, 464 pp., June 1992). Included
are classics from Plato and Hobbes to James and Ryle, as well as a dozen
more recents ones from either side of the AI vs. neural networks debate:
Chomsky, Fodor, Dennett, Kripke, vs. McClelland, Rumelhart, Hinton, Smolensky
and Patricia S. Churchland. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Somewhat distanced from this fray we find the most recent
philosophical effort by Francisco Varela, <B>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive
Science and Human Experience</B>. It was co-written with Evan Thompson,
a young philosopher and son of the cultural critic Willian Irwin Thompson,
and with Eleanor Rosch, a Berkeley psychologist (MIT Press, 1991, 308 pp.).
Previously circulated in xerox copies as &quot;Worlds Without Ground,&quot;
the book says that although the neural network approach to modelling the
human mind may include much more of the emergent processing involved in
learning, perception and intuition so ignored by rationalistic AI, something
very important is still left out: the body.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To include the body, the authors propose an &quot;enactive&quot;
approach, which derives from Varela's previous work with Humberto Maturana.
This centers on the bodily actions performed by the agent and their role
in shaping experience and intelligence. One prominent example and source
of inspiration used throughout the book is the authors' personal experience
with a particualr brand of Buddhist meditational practice. -- The book
is a very unusual and also accessible attempt to bring a spiritual perspective
to cognitive science. </FONT></P>
