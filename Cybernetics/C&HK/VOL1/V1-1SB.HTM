<I>About flat earths<SUP>1</SUP></I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I address you on this important and joyous day on the
Nature of Unreality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Unreality I define as the world in which we <B>consider</B>
that we live. And I explain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is a recent development in human understanding to accept
that our Earth is roughly spherical. Not so long ago, most people believed
it to be FLAT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Indeed, the Flat Earth Society had a considerable membership
- until the Russian satellite Sputnik went aloft.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>What is the cosmic situation today?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Let's look at the heavens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Surely that is the <B>real</B> universe out there, with
the Constellation Orion (one of the two that I can recognize) marching
across the sky.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But consider:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>The light we see reflected from the moon took little
more than a second to get to us;</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>but the light we recognize as Jupiter is already seven
hours old.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>The Orion <B>Nebula</B> appears as it used to be - 1500
years ago;</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>while the Megallanic Cloud Galaxies, which we can see
without a telescope, looked like that once... but that was two hundred
thousand years ago.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The night sky looks to us like a snapshot - a simultaneous
presence of reality. In fact, what we see represents a slice through time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Universe out there is absolutely not as it appears
- never was - never will be. It is manifest unreality. That is, if you
can ever find it.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Do you think that you new graduates could overcome your
embarrassment at being asked to join in a moment of audience participation?</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Would you please point to the stars.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Let the record show how many hands are pointing to the
ceiling!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We just agreed that the Earth is not flat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The stars are in whatever direction that anyone cares
to point. But...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We are stuck with an acceptable illusion of an unrecognized
unreality. Let's bring that - literally -down to Earth.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Our planet is our home. It has finite resources.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>We are systematically destroying Gaia, our Mother, Earth,
and all her species - at the rate of many-a-day.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Everyone here knows this well-researched reality. But
in our Unreality we find ourselves demanding more &quot;jobs, jobs, jobs&quot;
for despoilation</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>- and to support the military-industrial complex that
points the road to Armageddon.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It is because this unreal world is our familiar world,
and people do not have</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>- the insight<BR>
- the courage<BR>
- the ability<BR>
- the zeal<BR>
to question and confront it.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We do not allow ourselves to dwell on facts of war, of
famine, of torture. It is not conceivable, in our Unreality, that forty-thousand
children are <B>actually</B> dying every day. As Buddhists know, there
are burdens of common suffering that not everyone is able to bear. We live
in Unreality instead.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Let's take a local example:</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The facts of acid rain are clear enough, but the unreality
of practical politics has firm hold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So: the maple sugar industry in this Province is dying
now, and soon it will be dead -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>before the problem is addressed to scale on the unreal
calendars that politicians use.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So how can each of us take responsibility for the models
of unreality in which we live?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>They are prisons from which we can burst.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I'm afraid that the first of these prisons is the education
that we have received. It will be rough on brand new graduates - and on
their worthy teachers! - to hear that said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But not only technology is changing fast; so too are its
validating sciences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We are subject not only to amazing socio-political change,
but to underlying philosophic change as well.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Philosophy has been fitfully asleep for some two hundred
years; but</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>- in liason with a fast-evolving physics,<BR>
- and an adolescent neurocybernetics,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I expect a phenomenal breakthrough on the philosophic
front by the turn of the century. Look especially for revelations on the
epistemology of the SELF-AWARE.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So I want to congratulate you all on gown and hood - not
because of past achievements that they represent, but because you have
earned the rights and duties of updating the models that are the best that
we can teach today.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Now what about the <B>problems</B> that this responsibility
unfolds? Why should it be so difficult to &quot;update models&quot; (as
I put it) - which sounds like simply &quot;keeping abreast of your field&quot;?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Oh no, it is not just a question of <B>models</B> of Unreality.
It is a question of <B>paradigm</B>. I define a paradigm as a model that
exhibits a closed logic. It means that our attempts to break out of a fixed
pattern of thinking are constantly defeated - by running headlong into
our own premises.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Here is a delicate example:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>A small boy came up to me. He looked pointedly at my
beard and said:</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Were you in Noah's Ark?&quot;<BR>
I repudiated the suggestion.<BR>
&quot;Then&quot;, he said, &quot;why weren't you drowned?&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I have worked in eighteen countries now. If you do that,
watch out for cultural distinctions - for different models of society,
for difficult techniques of political adroitness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But look out the more for PARADIGMS that RESIST CHANGE.
<B>They</B> are common to all humanity.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;We cannot do as you propose, because our society
is corrupt.&quot;</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>After you have heard this eighteen times, you come to
realise that <B>all</B> societies are corrupt - including those who feel
free to lecture the others. <B>They</B> are constitutional liars and hypocrites
as well. The universal paradigm this represents is one which says:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;We cannot do as you propose because - you don't
understand - <B>that's</B> not how we do it.&quot;</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is the Noah's Ark Syndrome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A CHANGE, you must challenge not
only the models of Unreality, but the <B>paradigms</B> that underwrite
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Dangerous work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Out of my eighteen countries, I choose my homeland Britain
to make what I am saying exact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Unreality in which people live is a newly prosperous,
booming economy. The reality is that since 1979 the numbers living below
the Poverty Line have increased by 85%.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So today one third of British people subsist below Poverty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>What then has been done about that?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Money has been taken out of social welfare at a catastrophic
rate, and dispensed to the rich in tax rebates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I am often asked why this has not yet led to revolution.
Well: two thirds of the people are <B>not</B> in poverty, and the top half
are doing very well indeed. All that's left is to find a way to sustain
belief, at home and abroad, in the Unreality of Success.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Easy:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>The measure of Poverty has been officially abolished;</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>there will be no comparable statistics about which to
complain after this year.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Let us celebrate the fact that the vital place in which
to initiate change, to break the prison walls, to destroy paradigms, and
question models, is a private place where it can certainly be done.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It is within your own spirit;</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It is within your understanding;</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It is within your love for this miraculous life.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Withdraw from the Unreality we live, and find reality
itself. If you can find it within, then you have a chance to project it
to others and the world. Not otherwise. That has been said by every great
spiritual teacher....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But to renew that quest, consciously, every day, and to
question paradigms at every turn, is a peculiarly modern need.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And to embrace that challenge is perhaps more difficult
for the older among us than for the young.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>First, you have to resign publicly from the Flat Earth
Society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>That might mean resigning, as it has for me on several
occassions, from some prestigious and lucrative affiliations.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It's no good going on with paradigmatic nonsense - claiming
to be a liberal - if being liberal means conceeding the right to a contrary
opinion - on the understanding that it is absurd.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It's no good going on with paradigmatic nonsense - if
it involves a compromise that evades the issue (that will return next year),
by calling that compromise &quot;a victory for common-sense&quot;.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>It's no good nominating as &quot;principles&quot; a morality
that simply determines that I am right and you are wrong -</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>and calling &quot;facts&quot; those observations of the
world that validate one's &quot;principles&quot;.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Yes: qualifications are fine, even if they need to be
updated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But you cannot sit for a degree called CONTRAPARADIGM.
There are no qualifications in Insight, Courage, Ability or Zeal. And you,
and I, are going to need all four.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The acronym for Insight, Courage, Ability and Zeal is
ICAZ. And I wish it were more memorable! I have tried to steer you instead
towards ICAZ and the inner strength. It's all you've got in the end.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I said at the start that we deal in Unreality, that we
are stuck with <B>Illusions</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In his book of that name Richard Bach says this:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The simplest questions are the most profound.</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Where were you born?</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Where is your home?</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Where are you going?</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>What are you doing?</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Think about these once in a while, and watch your answers
change.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thank you.</FONT></P>
