<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Starting from its initial insights in the 1940s into the
nature of &quot;feedback&quot; and &quot;circular causal systems&quot;
(which by virtue of their circularity exhibit properties remarkably different
from those possible in the realm of linear cause and effect), cybernetics
has continued to unfold its seminal ideas and apply them to itself as a
domain of understanding - with the result that it has become (at least
for me) the science and art of the understanding of understanding.<SUP>2</SUP>
Indeed, my mentor, Gregory Bateson, called cybernetics &quot;the biggest
bite out of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that mankind has taken in
the last 2000 years&quot;.<SUP>3</SUP></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But what does that mean?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We have only to look around us (and inside our souls)
to see that something is wrong with the path that most of late twentieth
century Western culture seems to be taking. Unaware that &quot;the organism
which destroys its environment destroys itself&quot;,<SUP>4</SUP> we are
triggering potentially irreversible changes in the ecological system of
which we are a part. We also have a habit of seeing &quot;problems&quot;,
attempting to &quot;fix&quot; them, and then finding that, in a longer
time frame and in a wider spatial context, our very &quot;solu-tions&quot;
as often as not make things worse. Finally, we also do not suspect that
our very perception of &quot;how things are&quot; is grounded in habits
of thinking - which may be outmoded, and possibly lethal. Indeed, we are
mostly unaware that we have - or are - <B>an </B>epistemology . (And as
Gregory Bateson once wryly observed, &quot;You can-not claim to have no
epistemology. Those who so claim have nothing but a bad epistemology.&quot;)<SUP>5</SUP>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>What is epistemology? Human knowing (as well as that knowing
which is characteristic of all living systems).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a sense, there is nothing new in all this. Aspects
of Humberto Maturana's brilliant analysis of the difference between transcendental
and constitutive ontologies<SUP>6</SUP> have been intuited by many wise
women and men in past millennia and in a variety of cultures - but not
by very many, and not with the clarity and scientific sophistication which
Maturana's cybernetics offers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Heinz von Foerster, the father of the idea of second-order
cybernetics, refers to it as &quot;[a] turn from looking at things out
there to looking at looking itself&quot;.<SUP>7</SUP> And of course the
two moments of this turn are inseparable: you can-not have explicits without
implicits, and vice versa. (Notice that we can resolve the seeming dualism
between &quot;sub-ject&quot; and &quot;object&quot; by substituting the
words &quot;implicit&quot; and &quot;explicit&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To take seriously that everything said - <B>every-thing
said</B> - is said by an observer (an epistemology) to another observer
(again an epistemology), is to revolutionize human experience. It is to
hear every assertion not as a &quot;fact&quot; or a &quot;truth&quot; but
as an <B>invitation to orient</B> in a particular manner - and no more.
It is also to see that habits of orienting depend upon (inter-)personal
<B>history</B> (based, of course, on our initial biological structure)
- and no more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This realization - once real-ized and operationalized
- invites us to something we often wish to avoid but find much harder to
avoid once we understand second-order cybernetics: namely, human responsibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For one thing, we find ourselves invited to a whole new
understanding of the so-called &quot;mind/body problem&quot;. Mind/body
unity or dualism becomes a question not only of so-called &quot;fact&quot;
but also of ethics - of integrity, of integration, of being whole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>These understandings also bring into question some of
the early metaphors of cybernetics itself. Once we grasp that, as Maturana
phrases it, &quot;there are no instructive interactions&quot;<SUP>8</SUP>
(that -for example, in the case of human knowing - we are not built such
that some externality called &quot;information&quot; can enter us without
some operation on our part which in fact constitutes &quot;information&quot;
as &quot;information&quot;) - once we recognize that perception is an activity
and not a passivity<SUP>9</SUP> - the notions of &quot;communication&quot;
and &quot;control&quot;, as well as &quot;information&quot;, either require
redefinition or become quite obsolete; and we see that our responsibility
for our understandings is total. But we are not talking solipsism, for
language is constituted in our <B>interactions</B> (specifically, in our
consensual coordinations of consensual coordinations of actions), not in
our brains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We also learn that the past and future are stories we
tell ourselves in the present - again, inviting us in the direction of
responsibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Our very notions of &quot;change&quot; change. Paradoxically,
we find that we change, not by trying to be some image of self different
from who we are, but precisely by accepting who we are - and then finding
ourselves changed by virtue of having undergone that acceptance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Above all, we learn that &quot;responsibility&quot; and
&quot;ethics&quot; are not bludgeons with which to beat others about the
head: they are matters between oneself and oneself. As Heinz von Foerster
points out, it is the difference between &quot;Thou shalt&quot; and &quot;I
shall&quot;.<SUP>10</SUP> But even the &quot;shall&quot; drops out, because
ethics is not a matter of prescription but of taking responsibility for
one's actions. Thus, ultimately, we find that responsibility has to do
with <B>reembodying</B> ourselves - existentially healing the mind/-body
split in which we have lived for so long. Why? Because responsibility turns
out to be about <B>emotioning</B>, about our bodyhoods - specifically,
our awareness of our liking or disliking of the consequences of our actions.
And the experience of freedom is found to consist in our awareness of our
responsibility, i.e. in our awareness of our awareness of our liking or
disliking of the consequences of our actions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In short, if we wish to be free, we must be responsible
- or at least such is my understanding of the implications of Maturana's
cybernetics<SUP>11</SUP> (from which I have borrowed extensively in these
remarks).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To say it all slightly differently, we have the opportunity
to emerge from what Arthur Koestler<SUP>12</SUP> called &quot;the Cartesian
catastrophe&quot; (i.e. &quot;the identification of 'mind' with conscious
thinking&quot;) - into a lived awareness that, in the final analysis, caring
and clarity, far from being opposites, require each other in order to be
genuinely that which each aspires to be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In short, we can become whole - simultaneously integrating
mind and body as well as humanity and biosphere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Again nothing new - but something of considerable importance
to the fullness of our living, to the quality of our relationships, and
perhaps to the survival of our biosphere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So - why <B>Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing?</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Because it promotes the adventure of being <B>alive</B>
in our time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In this connection, it is noteworthy that Herbert Brun
defines cybernetics as &quot;the ability to cure all temporary truth of
eternal triteness&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The American Society for Cybernetics is proud to support
this journal of genuine cybernetic co-exploration into matters that concern
all of us. I applaud S&oslash;ren Brier's efforts and voice the fervent
hope that <B>Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing</B> will become an unparalleled
advocate for nontrivial exploration of a kind desperately needed in the
current age, fearlessly embodying that combination of rigor and imagination
which Gregory Bateson loved and lived, and which may well be balm for us
all.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Notes:</FONT></B></P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>1.I wish to make it clear that cybernetics - as befits
a science and an art which is vitally alive - consists of a wide variety
of theoretical positions, of which my own is only one. My particular understandings
owe much to Gregory Bateson, Heinz von Foerster, and Humberto R. Maturana.</FONT></LI>
