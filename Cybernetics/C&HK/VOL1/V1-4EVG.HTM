<h3 align="left">Ernst von Glasersfeld: <br>
<em>Discussions <br>
Questions rather than Answers</em></h3>

<p><font size="3">At the end of his paper, Dave Johnson says that
philosophy is a kind of narrative. I agree - and, as I have said
many times, my story makes no claim to be &quot;true&quot; or to <b>describe</b>
a &quot;real&quot; world; it wants to illustrate a way of
thinking I have found useful. I have told it often enough,
sometimes better than at others.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dave makes some claims here that prompt me to
ask questions:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.2: You say that, unless one makes the
distinction &quot;between what we think or say of the world and
the way the world is&quot;, it makes no sense to claim that a
certain wall was once a mere collection of stones.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Why should this be so? It surely would be
a sensible claim for the person who transformed a collection of
stones into a wall, and it would be a sensible claim on my part,
if I could tell from the look of the wall that, with the help of
a sledge hammer, it could be transformed again into a collection
of stones. I am dealing with nothing but experiential items and
operations which, in my past experience, have proved fairly
viable in the context of building walls and knocking them down.
Why, in either of the two cases, should I have to worry about
&quot;the way the world is&quot;? Or are you simply begging the
question by assuming that my experience is <b>necessarily </b>determined
by &quot;the way the world is&quot;?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.3: &quot;When I cannot predict the weather, I
look beyond myself to nature, its form and conditions, for an
explanation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Precisely: You <b>look</b> - and what you
see is what you see, and it can hardly have any but the
&quot;forms&quot; and &quot;conditions&quot; that you ascribe to
it. In other words, you're expanding your experiential horizon
and you call what you see &quot;nature&quot; - but it's still
part of your own experience - or do you want to spell nature with
a capital N, implying that it is what Vico called &quot;God's
world&quot;? &quot;The world itself&quot; is <b>your </b>phrase -
shouldn't you explain how you can come to &quot;see&quot; or
&quot;known&quot; it, when all you have are concepts and
conceptual operations that were derived from your experience?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.5: &quot;It is a truism that every theory of
knowing has psychological and ontological assumptions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: This sounds as though you were subscribing
to the rather recent fad of confounding ontological assumptions
with theoretical presuppositions. Would you go so far as to say
that Euclid's Elements are ontological assumptions, rather than
presuppositions for his geometry? If you do, wouldn't you have to
say that Riemann based his theory on a different ontology? And
would it not follow from this that the &quot;ontic&quot; world
must be either Euclidean or Riemannian? Or could there be
different &quot;ontic&quot; worlds? - Anyway who decreed that it
was unlawful to design a model of the experiential world based on
a number of presuppositions that explicitly disclaim any
ontological assumptions?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.5: &quot;Notice, too, that questions of
ontology and epistemology are reciprocally related from the
start:...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: The start of what? <b>Our</b> evaluation
of &quot;the conditions for success or failure&quot; and our
wondering how our thoughts might &quot;relate to a world outside
thought&quot;? Why, after 2500 years of fruitless wondering, is
it so reprehensible to try something else, viz., to see how far
one gets in constructing a model of the human knower and his or
her &quot;knowledge&quot; that does not assume the knowability of
ontological reality?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.7: The two quoted phrases of mine do
embarrass me now. I have learned how important it is to stress
that one can never be sure of ontic constraints (this was
implicit in the context - hence:).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: I wonder why you seem to have disregarded
what followed the second quotation, namely: &quot;...since this
'reality' manifests itself only in failures of our acting and/or
thinking, we have no way of describing it except in terms of
actions and thoughts that turned out to be unsuccessful (i.e.
negatively)?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.9: &quot;Other times, constructivists sound
more like realists, freely invoking the posits of commonsense and
science ...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Are &quot;posits&quot; not constructs?
Would you not agree that the history of science is a great
hunting ground for examples of posits that were considered
&quot;true&quot;, but turned out not to be viable in new or
expanded domains of experience?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.10: &quot; . . . since every instance of some
x &quot;fitting&quot; the constraints of the world (meaning-1)
will entail a positive description of that world; namely, <b>that
it so structured as to allow x to occur.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Does this not mean that there is an
infinite number of &quot;world-1&quot; structures that would
&quot;allow x to occur&quot;, and that occurrences of x,
therefore, bring us no nearer to a &quot;positive description of
that &quot;world-1&quot;?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.13: &quot;Notice that this claim involves
both realism (the idea of a reality beyond the isolated subject)
and idealism (the idea of cognitive isolation).&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: I'm glad you supply your definitions of
these terms. Now I can agree that I am a &quot;realist&quot; of
your sort (but of course not in the usual sense of a realist who
believes that he can make &quot;positive descriptions&quot; of
that reality beyond). But then I am driven to ask why your kind
of &quot;idealist&quot; in his &quot;cognitive isolation&quot;
should not be able and willing to accept, as so many sages have
done, the notion of an unfathomable world beyond cognition?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.13: &quot;... constraints emanating from the
world (meaning-1) that strikes the realist in von Glasersfeld as
relatively invariant or universal, and not to be paraphrased away
in terms of any one person's 'experiential world'.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Why &quot;universal&quot;? In my view, my
experiential world consists of invariants that I am able to
construct; and among those (relative) invariants are also the
items I call &quot;others&quot; to whom, after a while, I <b>impute,
</b>as Kant said, much the same constructive capabilities that I
ascribe to myself. The autonomy of the others (p.14), surely,
would be put in question only if I claimed that my constructs
were &quot;true&quot; rather than moderately viable (from my
point of view)?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.l5.: &quot;How, then, shall we defend the
idea that everyday objects like cats, trees, and other people are
both knowable and essentially independent of our every effort to
know them?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Indeed, how do you defend the idea of,
say, cats that are independent of &quot;our every effort to know
them&quot;?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.17: &quot;... we cut up the world into
objects when we choose a scheme of descriptions of the
world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Though I am not offended by being cited
together with Putnam and Rorty, here I don't agree that the
&quot;cutting up&quot; necessarily involves linguistic
descriptions. Having lived most of my life between languages, I
have come to believe that one can operate with concepts that are
not altogether determined by a given language (in this, of
course, I also differ from Maturana). But I would like to know
how our &quot;concepts or experience&quot; enable us &quot;to
judge ... whether our theories are true of the world&quot;?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.17: Quotation from Weissman.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Would it not help both Weissman and you to
adopt Hans Vaihinger's distinction between hypothesis
(=conjectures whose viability one expects to demonstrate by
experiences) and <b>fictions</b> (=inventions on the basis of
which one intends to make new conjectures) ? (Die Philosophie des
Als Ob, Berlin, 1913).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">p.l8: &quot;And that noumenal world will
certainly not fulfill the constraining, explanatory role
constructivist idealists require of it if their theory is to
avoid idealism or solipsism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Qu.: Why &quot;explanatory&quot;? You may
dislike the idea that the noumenal world may have something to do
with the viability of our constructs - and I have said often
enough that we cannot be sure in any particular case that the
constraintstems from &quot;it&quot; (pace Maturana - the French
expression <b>je ne sais quoi </b>would be better, I agree!). I
have great respect for what Vico called the <b>poetic wisdom </b>of
mystics and poets (to whom I would add metaphysicians) but I
cannot tell whether it provides them a glimpse of the noumenal.
Even if it did, it could not serve as explanation in my model. Do
you want to claim that an agnostic must not assume unknowable
things? - If you do, what would he be agnostic of?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If you feel like answering these questions we
might get closer to specifying the differences between our views,
rather than continue trying to prove the other wrong. From my
constructivist point of view, as you know, problems always offer
more than one way to find a solution.</font></p>
