<I>The Metaphysics of Constructivism</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>I assume that every theory of knowing presupposes an ontology or metaphysics,
identifying the organization of beings capable of knowing something and
the domain of objects and relations to which their knowledge claims might
apply. Constructivist epistemology will be no exception. In particular,
Ernst von Glaserfeld's &quot;radical&quot; constructivism and Humberto
Maturana's &quot;bringforthist&quot; position incline toward metaphysical
idealism, as both theories overstate the antirealist implications of a
trivially true version of perspectivalism. My outline of hypothetical realism
is designed to highlight several constructivist misconceptions, including:
(1) the idea that there can be no meaningful access to a world that exists
and has a nature independently of our making; (2) the idea that constructivism
alone recognizes the irreducible plurality of our perspectives on the world;
and (3) the idea that constructivist anti-realism is compatible with a
focus on the social or linguistic nature of experience. </P>
