<h3>Søren Brier: <br>
<em>Conversational Ethics and the Global Environment</em></h3>

<p>In recent years there has been much discussion about the
ability of ethics to construct a lasting foundation for corporate
cultures for businesses and institutions. The desired result
should hopefully be greater stability in a turbulent economy; and
a common framework which makes it easier to decentralize decision
making and responsibility. It should therefore be possible to act
faster and more effectively on local problems. In this extension
to Ole Thyssen's article on &quot;Ethics as Second Order
Morality&quot; in the first issue of this journal and Per
Thygesen Poulsen's article in no. 2/3: &quot;Turbulence and
Responsibility&quot; I will go a step further than just talking
about a company's or an institution's relationship to its
employees, customers and the surrounding society to talking about
its relation to the environment in a global perspective.1 </p>

<p>To behave decently towards nearly everyone is a part of what
we in our culture regard as good behavior. A common understanding
of what it means to behave properly is an important civilizing
element in any society. We all know that at times it can be very
difficult to be wellbehaved. But we have also learned to believe
that in long term it is worth the trouble, if only for the sake
of culture and civilization.</p>

<p>The basis of the democratic culture's conception of good
behavior is the view that other people are unique and free beings
with the same inherent qualities, aspirations and rights as
oneself. This has as a consequence that one can never
characterize another person fully via some kind of assessment
scale, such as work ability or intelligence. As a unique being
each person is of infinite value. This does not mean that we
cannot in principal always be replaced as workers precisely
because of the limitations of the situation.</p>

<p>Uniqueness and freedom have as their consequence that one can
never regard other people merely as means, but must always treat
them as ends in themselves. As beings they have the fundamental
authority to define their existence and its meaning themselves,
including their own values and their morality. And that entails
simultaneously that we must respect other people to do the same.
In this way it becomes not morality but ethics - understood as
the meta-discussion of morals and how they can function together
in a common system which is the universal basis for any
discussion of values. We must therefore accept that we can find
no universal morality. There are many ways of defining and
composing an assessment scale within the given ethical limits.
The consequence of this is that when one would fix a common
morality for others, as for example with the introduction of a
corporate culture, then it must be developed through discussion.
If one &quot;bosses&quot; one's morality through, then one
oversteps fundamental ethical rules. It is exactly these rules
that are the foundation of our democratic form of society.</p>

<p>This of course does not mean that one must not try to persuade
others through a rhetorical praising of the beauty, rationality
or effectiveness of one's own values. Neither does this mean that
one necessarily must be completely in agreement with everyone on
all details. But it does mean that it is necessary for each
person to find an acceptable and constructive form of working
relationship.</p>

<p>The difficulty with the use of discussion as a medium is, that
it demands an awareness of one's own values, an ability to
formulate them clearly, and to accept that this is just one way
out of many to do so. The three things go together since an
explicit formulation always demands a larger logical constancy
than meanings and feelings and strives to distinguish one's point
of view from that of others. Such an awareness of one's own
opinions of people, society and the world is decisive for being
able to use one's values creatively as a manager. The management
of free and responsible individuals, e.g. through a management or
corporate culture, presupposes such a formulation and awareness.</p>

<p>Management today is becoming a more generalized field of human
activity. Specialists can only deliver pieces of the jig-saw
puzzle, often too few, plus some that do not fit. The role of
management will be to set limits to the specialist's work, to
define the whole. The manager must first of all work with large
quantities of information. The task is to reduce the almost
limitless amount of information and degrees of freedom (possible
actions and choices). This can happen through rational
considerations, technical as well as economic and judicial. But
the technicaljudicial-economic rationality is in itself not
enough in a modern information society. The aesthetic and ethical
demands are coming increasingly into focus as an important
parameter in that decision process to reduce complexity for
specific decisions and for actions. Decisions are founded on
values values that spring from our own humanity, our
consciousness. To a considerable degree we create the world we
live in through our aesthetical views and ethical discussions and
dispositions with our peers.</p>

<p>Ethical consciousness is precisely the instance that should
guarantee the relationship between part and whole. As a part of
our culture, we have developed an overall ethic that considers
the individual and provides rules for the relationship between
different moralities and interests through human rights and the
idea of the hegemony-free discussion. Consequently, corp- orate
cultures should develop that build on mutual responsibility. It
is a question of making the values visible, the values that are
contained in long-term responsibility, in cooperation with all
stakeholders.</p>

<p>We must learn to express our basic values in a way that allows
us to enter into a dialogue with the values that are expressed
through the economic and scientific power-languages. This is if
we are to maintain our humanity as human beings in an
international multi-faceted culture based on democracy, human
rights, and a more or less free market, then we are obliged to
bring power, money, rationality and values into fruitful
dialogue. These domains often function in their own closed
systems in modern society.</p>

<p>The problem in the global market of the global city is not
just to behave decently in relationship to what our culture has
implanted in us. In a global perspective the task is much more
radical, namely to consider if we as a culture behave with
propriety towards other cultures and the environment. Even if we
act locally, we will be judged globally!</p>

<p>This, as far as it goes, is what we have always have had to.
But it has become more urgent over the last few years, because
the world and the market in increasing degree have undergone -
not just an internationalization - but a globalization. This is
because our technology has become so powerful that we can and
actually do undertake actions that have global range, such as
sending carbon dioxide, sulphur and ozone disintegrating
materials into the atmosphere, or spreading radioactive isotopes
over the whole planet when our atomic energy plants break down.</p>

<p>The starving children in the third world, increasing desert
growth in Africa, famines, the spread of AIDS and the increasing
number of pollution problems and accidents turns up not only in
the medias' collective conscience, but makes itself felt directly
now in the world economy, and threatens the liquidity of the
international banking systems.</p>

<p>In a longer perspective, one can for example just mention the
pollution of our own drinking water and the destruction of the
lakes' and coastal waters' capability to produce fish that will
influence our economy and our way of life for at least two future
generations.</p>

<p>Thus our own economical and technical development forces us
into a consciousness of this temporal and global development of
consciousness. It is this, more than anything else that in
reality forces us from the local morality towards a universal
ethic.</p>

<p>Our main problem seems to be that unfortunate side effects
from our way of producing and living have grown so much that it
is necessary to reevaluate our &quot;development paradigm&quot;.
Our materialistic growth paradigm seems to build upon an
unreasonable exploitation of nature and other cultures. The
surplus production we create does not benefit the needy on
anything that resembles a reasonable scale.</p>

<p>It is of course good to give aid to developing countries. But
how much does this actually help, when we year after year in fact
pull money out of the countries whose populations are starving?
This we do - among other things by keeping their industrial
products out with trade barriers, forcing them to export raw
materials and commodities to us for falling prices. Their
environmental problems increase, not least because they use
&quot;modern&quot; agricultural methods to cultivate saleable
crops to the West to enable them to pay off the interest rates of
their debt to us. At the same time we show contempt for the
violent nationalist and religious fundamentalist movements that
arise in these developing countries, - and which cut their
terrorist tracks deep into our culture, often supported by agents
from our own class or ideological conflicts.</p>

<p>But these violent methods - although we do not accept them -
cannot surprise us as long as we ourselves through our economic
industrial display of power ruin the quality of life and shorten
life in these countries. The North-South dialogue is still not
taking place according to the basic demands of the ethical
dialogue and Canada and Denmark are so far the only nations who
have given land back to the original inhabitants.</p>

<p>We are therefore forced to a higher degree of responsibility,
to think globally before we act locally and this is difficult
because our society and its various offficial and private
institutions are not at all geared to take such large
perspectives seriously. We have a long tradition of agreeing with
the futility of such universal speculations. We call it
&quot;philosophy&quot; and &quot;metaphysics&quot;.</p>

<p>The problem is that a greater part of our culture still seems
to be affected by a simplified mechanical understanding of nature
that leads us into the error that nature is a dead and relatively
simple thing which is &quot;outside&quot; us, and which we - for
these very same reasons - believe that we can obtain an almost
complete knowledge about and control of.</p>

<p>But new developments in thermodynamics, quantum physics,
mathematics (the theory of deterministic chaos and
non-liniearity), biology etc. seem to point more clearly towards
the view that a simple much less exhaustive picture of nature
cannot exist. In contemporary language one can say that the
amount of &quot;information&quot; about nature's objects is
infinite, and even the information found in a single grain of
sand can never be exhausted.</p>

<p>If one limits ones comments to our epistemological situation,
we must admit - as we in our time did with religion - that not
even natural science constitutes a special privileged road to the
ultimate truth about reality.</p>

<p>If one dares to say something general about the world or
reality on this basis, then one can say that this epistemological
reflection is in agreement with a world view that sees the world
as being infinitely complex, infinitely &quot;deep&quot; in its
structure, or &quot;possessing&quot; an infinite structural
wealth.</p>

<p>It is because of this impenetrable complexity that one cannot
give a finite or exhaustive description of the world or nature in
such a way that it can be used to direct or prescribe our actions
witb deterministic precision.</p>

<p>We have therefore no special precedence in relation to other
cultures when it comes to defining absolute aspects of reality.
Here it is as with morality: there are many useful local models
of reality. The basis for their communication and the possibility
of finding constructive convivial forms is the acceptance of that
none of them are universal.</p>

<p>It is crucial for the establishment of a new ethic that we
make clear to ourselves that &quot;the Truth&quot; is not given
by the sciences, in religion or (political) ideologies, or poetry
or myths. They all add valuable aspects to enlighten what life is
about, but none of them have &quot;the Answer&quot;.</p>

<p>This epistemology excludes certain types of conceptions,
namely those we usually call the fundamentalist. The
fundamentalists are typically convinced that they have understood
either the whole truth or anyway the most important parts of it
and that their conception is beyond every discussion or
interpretation. Amongst contemporary religions, it is at present
Islam that seems most inclined to show its fundamentalist side.
But our own materialistic scientific ideology combined with an
atheistic rationality is also a candidate, at least if we do not
open up for a discussion with other cultures!</p>

<p><strong>Ecology and Ethics</strong></p>

<p>Our ecological experiences have taught us that when we burn
our outrageously large amounts of refuse; Dioxin is produced,
which through the chain: grass, cows, women, mother's milk,
breast babies, ends up in our children in overdoses. Also when we
spray with DDT in Africa, the global ecological connection
manifests itself in the DDT that accumulates in the penguins at
the South Pole.</p>

<p>There is very strong ecological evidence that we have a very
close connection with the rest of nature (through biogeochemical
cycles in ecosystems) and through that to the other cultures and
their treatment of it, and vice versa. We are ourselves an open
self-organized system which is dependant on the flow of energy
and material we receive from nature. Therefore environmental
problems are all very important for our health.</p>

<p>One can actually say that our health ultimately through
ecological systems and the nutrient cycles - is connected with
the earth's &quot;health&quot;. Nature does a good job
&quot;for&quot; and &quot;in&quot; us which we tend to ignore in
our rationalist culture.</p>

<p>But we have nothing on which to base our ethics in relation to
our society's ecological foundation, even if we, scientifically
via ecology, try to establish an extended rationality with regard
to nature. Real responsibility also builds on caring, empathy and
values - and thereby to a certain degree on identification. But
we have lost that interdependence with nature. We have separated
ourselves from nature through our culture and our technology.
Therefore it is important that we reassess this subject in an
ethical connection. We must learn again to commit ourselves to
the unity that constitutes culture and nature.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that nature, with its vast complexity and
dynamics can carry itself in thousands of ways, that will be in
agreement with a humanly desirable existence. Therefore we can
not determine a final correct, original or natural state of
nature: This would be ecological fundamentalism. And this is the
third of the great fundamentalist dangers that threaten our
culture, in addition to the religious and the mechanical natural
scientific.</p>

<p>We<em> are</em> able to determine a series of states of nature
which lead to undesirable human conditions, such as the painful
and limited conditions which develop when our organisms
accumulate too many heavy metals, (such as mercury, lead and
cadmium) or poisons such as DDT and Dioxin.</p>

<p>Our problem is to take the ethical and moral consequences of
this knowledge into a society whose institutions are not at all
geared to the necessary kind of action and cognition. It is very
difficult because amongst other things we are talking about
intangibles such as our responsibility towards other living
creatures; the future generations and the poor in underdeveloped
countries; as to what culture and the quality of life is about;
and as to how we ourselves can decide the direction of
development. It is clear that an embedding of environmental
considerations in our economical system through the establishment
of a series of environment taxes is desirable, not just on a
national scale but also on a global scale combined with
prohibitive legislation. But legislation in itself is not enough.
There must also be an elucidation of attitudes, and the
consequences they have both in the private and working lives of
both the individuals and the company/institution. We often see
how an individual feels trapped because society and institutions
do not take clear moral and ethical stands. In our society it is
not - in contrast to the fundamentalist desirable to be a martyr.</p>

<p>If we accept ethics as second-order morals - and with it
conversation - as the forum in which the voluntary choice of
values and actions should take place, then it must also apply to
other peoples and nations independent of the position of power
they actually have in relationship to us. And this must also
apply to children, who will inhabit the world they inherit from
us. Our actions must also be valued in a future perspective.</p>

<p>Therefore, what we need is for businesses and institutions -
private as well as public - through discussion with all who work
there to publically clarify their values, concerning the
environment and First/Third world difficulties. In this way it
will be legitimate for workers and leaders to participate
creatively in producing good environmental and global cultural
resonsible answers to the company's, the institutions' - and
ultimately - society's problems.</p>
