<I>The Possibility of the impossible</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Swedish artist Oskar Reutersv&auml;rd has made a series
of drawings under the common title &quot;perspective japonaise&quot;. They
show us seemingly three-dimensional objects which on closer scrutiny are
found to be &quot;impossible&quot;. An example is shown above. Of course
you could look upon these drawings just as a good joke. But the drawings
- like the well-known pictures of Escher - bring up a question of far-reaching
importance: Exactly what do we mean when we say that a fictitious object
is &quot;impossible&quot;?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The first reaction would be to regard the Reutersv&auml;rd
pictures as optical illusions. After all, we are spontaneously interpreting
a drawing on a flat surface as representing a three-dimensional solid object.
This, however, is only due to our perceptual habits. The picture could
as well represent, say, a flat sculpture made of metal wires. The depth
we perceive in a picture is always illusory. But what then? I would not
say this is the essential point in discussing these drawings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The most challenging question is not whether the pictures
may be `explained' in terms of what we know about visual perception, but
rather, what such pictures, deliberately regarded as representations, can
reveal to us. If we accept what we see - what do the pictures tell us;
what kind of reality do the depicted objects have? And, again, what makes
us call them &quot;impossible&quot;?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In fact, this is not quite as trivial a question as it
might seem. Let me render it more incisive. How do we <B>know</B> that
the object represented on the drawing cannot <B>exist</B>? - Is it because
we have never seen a body of that particular shape? No, it is not merely
a question of what we are accustomed to seeing. We feel sure that we will
not some day come across an object of this odd shape. Nor is it a logical
conclusion, since who is prepared to state on the spot the axiomatic premises
from which such a conclusion could be drawn? But if it is neither an empirical
fact nor a theoretical conclusion - what is it? I would suggest that it
is a <B>practical</B> conclusion. We just cannot imagine how to <B>make</B>
such an object.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I mean, suppose we regard the drawing as a design for
an object to be fabricated, say, out of pear-wood. And let us try to realize
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We start by making a number of straight, square beams.
Then we put them together, one after the other, starting somewhere in the
structure, following the drawing. To begin with, it works well enough.
But very soon you find that you cannot manage to join two ends that should
be joined according to the drawing. The object cannot be finished, you
have to leave it &quot;open&quot;. If you start anew, putting beams together
in another order this time, you will sooner or later get stuck again. In
this way you get a number of unfinished objects. It seems as if the impossibility
at issue is the impossibility of making one uniquely connected object,
as shown on the drawing. (In a way you could say the drawn object is a
`synthesis' of a number of related possible objects.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The paradox is, however, that if you consider a sufficiently
small region of the drawing the oddness disappears. That is to say, the
`impossibility' is not here, or here - it is something about the object
<B>as a whole</B>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Nothing is wrong with the beams that make up the structure,
nor with the way two beams are joined together orthogonally to each other.
Locally the object is quite all right. But the local consistency of the
structure does not guarantee the consistency of the whole of it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But does not this give you an uneasy feeling? I am afraid
that we usually design complex structures just by putting well-established
facts together in a clever way, and relying on `continuity' to secure the
feasibility of the whole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At least this seems to be the way our bureaucrats try
to organize society. In our desperate efforts simultaneously to follow
all rules that together should make our society perfectly organized, we
probably look like people trying to put together one of Reutersv&auml;rd's
impossible structures!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the case of a Reutersv&auml;rd drawing you can without
much difficulty directly `see' whether it will do as an ordinary three-dimensional
body or not. But suppose we invent a complicated system, made up of parts
or sub-routines, that are in perfect condition taken by themselves, and
which are interconnected in a reasonable way, we still cannot be sure that
the structure as a whole in reality will not turn out to be nonsensical.
I think some people's ingenious designs for a perpetuum mobile belongs
here (and by the way one of Es-cher's famous pictures shows us one!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Moreover, is this not the way we scientists make up our
`world picture' - each research worker contributing his straw to the big
ant-hill? But if local consistency does not guarantee the consistency of
the whole....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So what hope do we have that our scientific world picture
is not an impossible drawing, like the Reutersv&auml;rd ones?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Now, to put it in more general terms, let us regard Reutersv&auml;rd's
axonometric drawings as a kind of `<B>picture language</B>'. Any `sentence'
in this language is constructed in strict adherence to a set of rules,
that is to say, a simple grammar. Each sentence can be interpreted as a
`proposition', i.e. a suggested design for any of the three-dimensional
objects that the language `is about'. Some propositions are semantically
true, others false. To be able to distinguish the `true' designs from the
`false' ones you have to take a position `outside' the picture language,
since you must know what the symbolic constructions `are about'. In complicated
cases, it may not be until you put a proposition to practical test that
you find that it tells sheer nonsense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If you are a pupil learning the noble craft of making
axonometric perspective drawings, and you happen to draw an `impossible'
figure, your teacher would tell you: &quot;No, this is <B>wrong</B>, you
are not allowed to draw these lines here, you see&quot;. In this way the
pupil develops a skill to avoid making `wrong' pictures. But in the case
of very complicated structures, he would still, at some rare occasions,
make a mistake and draw an impossible connection. Would it not be better
to include among the rules of the axonometric perspective a rule to prevent
the drawing of non-permissable connections? Well, the problem is that in
order to apply such a rule you must refer to the drawer's idea<B> about
what kind of object he is drawin</B>g. i.e. which one of all possible figures
he intends to represent. So it cannot be a formal rule within the grammar
of the axonometric perspective. All pictures are <B>formally</B> correct.
The settlement, whether a drawing is `true' or not, must be done on the
level of a <B>meta-language</B>, which comprises the interpretation of
the sentences of the picture language.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To formalize such a meta-language would be quite a tedious
procedure, I am afraid. It must include the axioms for some kind of `space'
in which the structures extend themselves, and where the terminal points
of beams can meet - or not meet, as the case may be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Look at figures A-E below! A is an impossible figure,
which is a `synthesis' of B-E. If you would prevent the drawing of a figure
of type A, which connections should be forbidden? In fact, <B>any</B> line
in A must be permissable, since it appears in some or other of the <B>possible</B>figures
B-E. If you do not know which one of B,C,D,E is intended you cannot tell
<B>a priori</B> which line connections should be forbidden and which not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If you asked Reutersv&auml;rd when drawing one of his
figures: &quot;What do you intend to represent in this drawing?&quot; he
would answer &quot;I don't know. I am just making one of my pictures, following
the rules of the `perpective japonaise'. Let's see what comes out&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, it cannot be said that the Reutersv&auml;rd drawings
are wrong or that they do not make sense. It is only that they do not <B>refer</B>
to anything - at least not in our ordinary world of tables and chairs.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../C&HK/vol1/vol1-1ps2.gif" HEIGHT=258 WIDTH=262></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For comparison consider the well-known creature called
<B>centaur</B>. It is half human being, half horse, and has been depicted
countless times. So the word certainly has a meaning, although the creature
in question does only have a mythological existence. Let me bring another
example, this time from mathematics. In elementary arithmetic the expression
&Ouml;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not make sense (and it does not on your pocket
calculator either!). However, at the more abstract level of algebraic notation,
&Ouml;&nbsp; is a meaningful expression, since it says &quot;take the square
root of the number a&quot;. It is only that for a&lt;0 it does not refer
to any real number. But then, if we just <B>postulate</B> the existence
of numbers being referred to by the expression in case of a&lt;0, and try
to construct these numbers in a logically consistent way, it turns out
that a fruitful theory of so called `complex numbers' can be developed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Well then, let us permit ourselves to speculate freely
about what the challenging drawings of Reutersv&auml;rd could possibly
refer to! First, suppose the drawing above shows the result of the mapping
of a huge object that we explore by moving about on it. Without our observing
it, the object changes its shape in the course of our investigation. So
far, we have taken it for granted that Reutersv&auml;rd's pictures represent
synchronous slices of space-time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But who says an artist must act like a camera? And who
says he must show us ordinary, rigid bodies of invariable shape?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Secondly, I observe tmolecular level, if quantum mechanics
is taken for granted. A fundemental principle in quantum mechanics states
that any superposition of observable states of a system is to be regarded
as a possible state of the system as well. In discussing the structure
of molecules and the nature of the chemical bond, the phenomenhat some
of the `impossible' objects make one think of the world of atoms and molecules.
Now, as a matter of fact, the relation between the whole and its parts
turns out to be rather paradoxical at the on of <B>mesomerism</B> means
that the actual electron distribution must be conceived as lying somewhere
&quot;between&quot; the electron distributions implied by the limiting
formulae, the so called <B>canonical structures</B>, which are possible
to illustrate by concrete models on the macroscopic level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the other hand, a so called `impossible object' might
be looked upon as a `superposition' of a number of possible objects (i.e.
the various configurations you arrive at in trying to assemble the impossible
one!) So, maybe, Reutersv&auml;rd shows us a world of quantum-mechanically
indeterminate objects - the possibility of the impossible!</FONT></P>
