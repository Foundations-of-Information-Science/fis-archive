<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>In the beginning was the word, and primitive societies

who would perpetuate their history in song;</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Kevin Crossley-Holland, <B>The Norse Myths</B>, p. 190</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In reading Norse Mythology, one is faced with the task
of understanding the deeply condensed metaphors, or kennings, that imbue
the sagas with much of their flavor and character. The myths build on themselves
and embody their own evolution in such a way that it becomes essential
to know that 'Otter's ransom' and 'Fafnir's lair' are kennings for 'gold.'
In the Prose Edda, particularly in the part called 'Skaldskaparmal' (Poetic
Diction), Snorri Sturluson describes rules for poetic diction and links
knowing how to compose in the scaldic tradition to being familiar with
(knowing, in this sense) the kennings (Crossley-Holland, 1980). In so doing
he links human knowing to an understanding of the traditions and history
of interactions of which we, by our participation, become a part, AND to
the mutualness that inheres in metaphoric processes of &quot;seeing-as&quot;
- a connection that might find more modern parallels in the later Wittgenstein
(cf, <B>Philosophical Investigation</B>, 1958), and modern cybernetic thought.
Indeed, it is useful to understand that the meaning of kenning has its
roots in the Old Norse, <I>kenna</I>, which has been translated as &quot;to
name with a kenning, or to know&quot;. So a kind of metaphoric process
is inextricably linked with a kind of knowing. I say &quot;a kind of&quot;
here, not in any strictly classificatory sense, but rather to acknowledge
that many languages, including the Scandinavian languages, have different
terms for describing what become for English speakers, different kinds
of &quot;knowing&quot;. Thus, in learning a Scandinavian language, or many
other languages for that matter, a native English speaker must defamiliarize
himself or herself with usual orientations (Becker, 1989), and, for example,
learn to separate knowing facts from other sorts of knowing processes,
including those, as the idea of kenning evokes, of &quot;becoming familiar
with.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a journal that chooses its entitlement as <B>Cybernetics
and Human Knowing</B>, linking knowing processes to cybernetics means becoming
acutely aware of the ways of forming connections, of the ways of seeing-as.
And as Bateson (1991) did in &quot;Men Are Grass&quot; [Grass dies, men
die, men are grass], it means becoming aware of metaphoric process as itself
a root metaphor in the production of knowledge - a production that in Western
thought has often been tied exclusively to certain kinds of syllogistic
reasoning, such as the &quot;Barbara&quot;, or Socrates syllogism [Men
die, Socrates is a man, Socrates will die]. Indeed, it was precisely this
exclusivity that Bateson tried to dispel in linking knowing to metaphoric
process, and ultimately, to a cybernetic epistemology. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Cybernetic knowing embraces kennings and metaphoric process.
Yet, in an anti-discipline such as cybernetics, we must become aware of
the metaphors we use to refer to those selfsame knowing processes. Thus,
as Salmond (1982) notes, there is quite a difference between the English
metaphor of knowledge as a landscape, which invites having perspectives
of a ground that is inexhaustible, and, for example, Maori metaphors of
knowledge that evoke its exhausti-bleness and destructibility, and require
a sensitivity to the need for its continual production and reproduction
(in a tradition evocative of that which Snorri Sturluson attempted to create
and sustain in his reliance on kennings in his Prose Edda). Indeed there
is not only a difference between different ways of forming the usu-al 'knowledge
as vision' metaphors (a cyber-netic 'perspective' , or 'point' of view,
compared to cybernetics as a &quot;<B>way</B> of seeing&quot; that features
a process), but also an awareness of the different kinds of <B>con</B>sensuality
(feeling, hearing) through which we might &quot;envision&quot; different
manners of knowing practices. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Further, in an anti-discipline such as cybernetics, where
self-reference is legitimized as both explanatory and evidentiary, we must
become sensitive to the mutualness of any metaphoric process. That is by
referring to something (or some process) as something else, we cannot assume
the referent as having a fixed meaning for all. Any meaning-creation is
shaped by what is &quot;doing the referring&quot; and who is forming the
connection, the &quot;seeing-as&quot;. Thus, in saying &quot;Our organization
is a family&quot; it cannot be assumed that we all think of family (and
then, of course, our organization) in the same way - for some may use the
metaphor to construct a happy and harmonious family (and then organization),
while others create one founded on constant bickering. In addition, such
a connection allows for a re-understanding of &quot;family&quot; through
the very process of its being referred to in that particular manner and
context (cf, Sapir, 1977, for an extension of this point). We must be aware
of how, as Wagner (1986) notes, symbols can stand for themselves. Yet,
this 'symbolic' self-reference is done with an other, through which we
make and see our 'selves'. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We must also be aware of how our process of forming connections
and mutualnesses is integral to any seeing or feeling in a <I>new</I> way
that is at the heart of any creative enterprise. Indeed, just as scientific
and technological discoveries are often imbued with a (sometimes mystical)
flash of a 'seeing-as', as with Watson and Crick's double helix or Kekule's
ring, new knowledge becomes equated with being able to effectively use
a metaphor which has socially situated currency. I mention this here because
cybernetics, which is so often linked to a new age of technological wizardry
in cyberspace by cyberpunks, can and must relocate these strictly techno-metaphors
- without losing them - in a broader landscape or even a broader process.
While we rely heavily on such kennings as Ashby's homeostat and the Turing
machine as part of the history we, as cyberneticians, sustain and recreate,
we also need to be aware of the process of <I>how</I> WE generate these
particular ways of forming connections. Cybernetic connections are born
of a tradition of centrality of &quot;mutual and circular feedback processes
in social and biological systems&quot; that were the Macy conferences (c.f.,
Heims, 1991 for an elaboration of these crucial meetings). In this tradition
we have evolved to embrace, through second order cybernetic ideas, what
Shotter (1990) identifies as a critical circular relationship between making
and finding worlds. Shotter notes how what we find (&quot;finding&quot;)
in our worlds is rooted in how we construct those worlds (&quot;making&quot;),
while our &quot;finding&quot;, in turn, 'lends' structure to the very &quot;making&quot;
of those worlds we construct. Processes of making and finding (worlds)
thus mutually determine each other and then, themselves. Processes of making
and finding mutual relationships (which we can call mutualling) is cybernetics.
</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>A cybernetic tradition</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A recognition of circular processes of many kinds has
become the hallmark of a cybernetic epistemology (Bateson, 1972). In fact,
as von Foerster (1987) notes, &quot;Should one name one central concept,
a first principle, of cybernetics, it would be circularity.&quot; Cybernetics,
in its early formulation, was concerned with communication and control
<B>in</B> the animal and the machine (Wiener, 1948). In defining cybernetics,
the choice of &quot;in&quot;, rather than &quot;of&quot;, was not whimsical,
for it allowed for a focus on processes of <B>self</B>-regulation and <B>self</B>-organization
(McCulloch,1974). Early cybernetic work focused on circular causal feedback
mechanisms, and applications of these mechanisms, together with the principles
underlying them (see, e.g., Heims, 1991), - principles which, in many views
(cf, Gardner, 1987) underlay the explosion of the computer/cognitive sciences,
and indeed are credited with being at the heart of connectionist and neural
network approaches in computing. This focus on connections of many different
sorts was achieved through developing an understanding, in both a theoretical
and a practical sense, of processes involving circularity and self- reference.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Margaret Mead (1968), in a paper entitled, &quot;Cybernetics
of Cybernetics,&quot; spoke to a desire and hope for cybernetic understanding
to foster a development of a new &quot;language&quot; to deal with interdisciplinary
issues, and to the need for cyberneticians to examine their own organiza-tion,
effectively applying cybernetics to itself. Second-order cybernetics was
thus born. Heinz von Foerster (1974, 79) then forced the issue by shifting
the focus from a cybernetically-oriented concern with systems that could
be ob-served, to one more clearly including and then focusing on those
doing the observing -- hence, his identification of second order cybernetics
with that of <B>observing systems</B> (and what we might call &quot;observing
observing&quot;). The implications of this shift are enormous, but have
yet to become fully realized, particularly with regard to epistemolological
and methodological concerns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It can be argued that although it might make sense to
apply any process to itself (such as the physics of physics), the practice
of cybernetics, by definition, necessitates that we do so. What has emerged
as cyberneticians have turned cybernetics onto itself, is a concern, not
just with distinctions that create &quot;circular feedback mechanisms&quot;
and &quot;mutual relationships&quot; that may be observed, but also with
<B>our observing processes and actions</B> that allow our observations
to become realized. A second order cybernetics forces us to recognize ourselves
as observers, and to accept responsibility for our observations, descriptions
and explanations, rather than merely reporting the state of an independently
existing universe. But rather than being subsumed within a strictly cognitive
enterprise, an awareness of the embedded relationships of observing forces
us to contextually recognize the various mutually defining relationships
to which <B>our</B> knowing activities are tied. In short, we must concern
ourselves with how WE build up our systems of knowing and acting. Cybernetic
knowing is a self-reflexive enterprise, but it is a self-reflexiveness
that is at once a <I>social</I> process, accomplished in dialogue, and
indeed requiring <B>others</B> (cf, the various essays in Steier, 1991).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Understanding the processes of our own constructions as
revealed in our systems of knowing and acting, and locating them in a tradition
within which they fit (or make sense) and, in turn, sustain, has had dramatic
effects on the ways that cyberneticians have come to understand their own
everyday activities. Indeed, it is through what might be called a cybernetic
awareness that such everyday activities have been redefined within the
cybernetic community and in those whose lives are touched by our interactions
and conversations. We thus have witnessed more relational formulations
of such traditionally univocal and strictly other-directed activities as
planning and designing (c.f., Richards [1989], Herbst [1974], Greenbaum
and Kyng [1991]) and research (c.f., Steier, 1991) such that they become
rethought as more participatory (other based) AND more selfreflexive. Designing,
planning and researching become activities in which knowing in those domains
is embedded in relationships that are best understood by cybernetic principles.
They are activities in which knowing is participatory and embedded in what
Vickers referred to as an <B>ecology</B> of ideas (1968), a concept later
developed and extended by Bateson (1979). It is an ecology of ideas whose
eco-ness depends on an appreciation of the participation of those others
whom our activities both affect and rely on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, cybernetics has evolved to include a mutualness
of self-reference through the observing of otherness coupled with the otherness
of observing. As cyberneticians, we have done this through a continual
recursive (in the second order sense) re-enactment and then re-creation
of our own tradition, knowing it in the scaldic sense (&quot;being familiar
with&quot;), while continuing to develop ways of expressing to ourselves
and others the mutual processes that we mark as important.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Those interested in where cybernetics has evolved today
can look at the names that have been offered as titles of the most recent
(American Society for Cybernetics) cybernetic conferences. Today's conference
organizers are as poets who have the power to name and thereby create possibilities
for particular kinds of connections for all of us: Cybernetics as Connections,
as Ecological Understanding, and as its own Evolution and Praxis<SUP>1</SUP>
are three most recent offerings. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>From hierarchy to participation: Contrasts with systems
theory</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In its inherent concern with interdependence formed of
relationships between parts of a system, rather than an atomistic reduction
of systems to separable component parts, cybernetics has often been linked
to general systems theory. While it is true that there is much in common
between systems theorists and cyberneticians, there are also crucial differences.
One main difference centers on what is offered as a main principle of systems
theory, (as put forth by systems theorists, for example, von Bertalanffy
[1968]), concerning the necessity of a particular form of relationship,
namely that of hierarchy. The necessity of hierarchy is often linked by
systems theorists to any evolution of complex systems, and to their understanding
(cf, Simon, 1969). Hierarchy, as a property of complex relationships, is
then often taken axiomatically as an unassailable 'given' to which one
must be true in order to claim a systems approach. Unfortunately, we have
moved from recognizing hierarchy as a useful organizing device for some
systems of relationships (as Simon [1969] notes in his parable of the watchmakers,
Hora and Tempus), to seeing it as necessary in all systems. Further, we
have failed to consider the consequences for systems of human knowing (and
for what a <B>systemic</B> approach might actually minimally require) as
well as for organizations, built on principles of hierarchy. Indeed, as
Herbst (1976) points out in his <B>Alternatives to Hierarchies</B>, it
is precisely this reliance on hierarchy as a system of thinking that leads
to a totalitarian (in the sense of dictated from the top) logic. Herbst
(1976, 87) calls for replacing the totalitarian logic which forms the bedrock
of our dominant systems of knowing with a contextual logic (tied to, and
growing from Spencer-Brown's [1969] self-referential based <B>Laws of Form)</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Herbst's contextual logic is classically cybernetic in
its reliance on a mutualness inherent in any self-referential system. It
is not mere coincidence that he links his contextual logic to a way of
researching where the product of research is a new (self-maintaining learning)
process tied to a collaborative researcher/ 'researched' relationship.
It is here that the difference between systems theory and cybernetics is
most striking. As noted above, cybernetics, from its inception, has insisted
on mutualnesses and circularities of many forms. Causality, if one chooses
this explanatory route, is but one of many possible circular relationships
that define how we construct the systems in which we are embedded and with
which we interact. Indeed, circularity is but one of many kinds of [spatial]
metaphors of mutualness, as has been noted by those trying to enable a
more emancipatory process out of reflexive concerns (e.g., Steier, 1991;
Gergen and Gergen, 1991) with a spiraling whose &quot;referring back&quot;
moves a knowing process to a different, and unspecifiable in advance, dimension.
Additionally, it is a &quot;referring back&quot; (or self-reference) that
is done through or with an &quot;other&quot;, an other that simultaneously
participates in <B>its</B> own self-reference. Cybernetics thus is immersed
in logics of participation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A consequence of the connectivities of this sort is that
cybernetics becomes a way of knowing that <I>gives voice</I> to all of
those who participate in the knowing process, in Herbst's collaborative
sense, and in a decidedly nonhierarchical fashion. It is a paradigm of
<B>conversing</B> in the sense of turning together, with others, [cf, Steier,
1992], rather than a reliance on a <B>universing</B> dictated by those
who claim to be objectively outside of, and unaffected by their knowledge
claims and observations, and whose research subjects are subjected to being
told what they &quot;really are doing.&quot; A choice between cybernetics
and systems theory is then a <I>political</I> one that has implications
for an ethic one embraces with regard to an attitude towards human knowing
in many senses. Indeed, colleagues and I have taken to referring to those
with whom we are engaged in research, traditionally referred to as subjects
or informants, as <B>reciprocators</B>, following Ortega y Gasset [1957].
(Of course, reciprocation is a kind of mutualness). By so doing, we seek
to recognize the importance of how we refer to each other as another kind
of mutualness connected to systems of human knowing. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>An Eastern connection</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Cybernetics can be seen as the most Eastern of Western
philosophies; postmodern concerns with the harmony that results from giving
voice to multiple descriptions, and with <B>relational</B> understanding
mark this interhemispherical connection even more strongly. It is interesting
to note that Takeshi Umehara (1992), in discussing the Confucian roots
that may be at the heart of postmodernism, refers to a reliance on both
<B>mutualism</B> and <B>cyclicity</B> (where cyclicity can be understood
as a kind of a mutualism and self-reference across time). Umehara notes
that in Japanese, the word <I>ningen</I>, meaning person, originally meant
&quot;between people&quot;, and this relational root allows for ethics
to be understood as being between people. Umehara remarks that </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The central principles of the postmodern world view then,
are mutualism and cyclicity: mutualism - ethics born out of a relationship
with the &quot;other&quot; and nature instead of from the self-interest
of the absolute individual; and cyclicity - an ethics of generational responsibility
born of the belief in continuous rebirth, a belief in the fusion of being
and becoming in to a time of eternal recurrence. (p. 13).</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is perhaps not surprising then, that the current Western
fascination with Eastern management philosophies born of a reliance on
mutualism and cyclicity, would seem to fit well with cybernetic principles
in the praxis of organizational and extra-organizational life. Moreover
by focusing on the process basis that is so much ingrained in Confucian
thought, we can re-understand the history of cybernetics as concerned with
the processes of making and finding mutualisms - Cybernetics as an art
and science where closed systems means connected systems.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>The poetic diction of cybernetics as mutualling</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Cybernetics is about understanding relationships and making
connections in many senses. These range from understanding metaphoric process
and seeing-as as described in this essay, to the inter-personal linkages
that allow cybernetics to be a place where artists and biologists, cognitive
scientists and family therapists, information scientists and educators,
and filmmakers and managers confer and jointly stipulate worlds. It is
about recognizing the ecological processes that simultaneously make us
sensitive to the multiple environments in which our knowing processes are
embedded AND to our own &quot;household&quot; that creates the necessity
of a reflexive awareness so critical to cybernetic knowing. It is about
understanding how our everyday activities are informed by our multiply
cybernetic ways of seeing, feeling and hearing in the conversations in
which we locate ourselves. Our seeing connections and our ecological understanding
are linked to action in our everyday praxis, building on our own histories
of interactions, which in turn inform our ever cascading reinterpretation
of what is cybernetics - cybernetics as a self-reflexive generative metaphor
whose meaning is tied to an everyday praxis of multiple ways of knowing
in a context.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Cybernetics has been many things to many people, with
the history of cybernetics marked by a multiplicity of definitions. These
include Warren McCulloch's experimental epistemology concerned with the
generation of knowledge through communication, Gregory Bateson's forms
and patterns that connect, and Gordon Pask's art of manipulating defensible
metaphors<SUP>2</SUP>. A thread linking the many definitions would be a
concern for connections in the form of mutual relationships that determine
each other, and ultimately then, each self. As cyberneticians we are, as
Heinz von Foerster has stated many times, poets, poets who have the power
to &quot;see as&quot; and thereby to name (and to control, in that creative
sense). Thus, the poetic diction of cybernetics embodies processes of knowing
through seeing-as, as a making of mutual relationships, and processes of
finding, or seeing mutual relationships in those constructions we have
made. Cybernetics as... mutualling.</FONT></P>
