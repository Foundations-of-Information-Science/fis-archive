<i>Stereotyping and Constructivism: Learning to be Men and Women</i></h3>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>In this paper Bateson's (1972) ideas on levels of learning are
used to analyze processes involved in learning gender
stereotypes. In his theory there is a distinction between
learning a behaviour (level one) and learning that a behaviour is
stereotyped (level two). Such classification of behaviour occurs
in social contexts, a fact which contributes to our understanding
of both their role in identity and their resistance to change.
Third level learning, which may be needed to change stereotypes
learned under level two processes, reduces conflict between
different stereotypes but at the cost of change in an
individual's identity. Misdirected attempts to promote level
three learning may be counterproductive if the challenge to
identity is threatening. Questioning or counterexamples which
allow re-consideration of stereotypes, or activities which make
caricatures out of the stereotypes, are offered as ways of
promoting change which are not threatening by being respectful of
the learner's identity. </p>
