<I>Why I Consider Myself a Cybernetician</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P><I>Remembering that he joined one of the first European cybernetics
centers more than three decades ago, the author asks himself how he came
to consider himself a cybernetician. Accepting Bateson's notion that cybernetics
focuses on constraints rather than causes, he suggests that his early immersion
and interest in several languages and the different world-wiews they entail
directed his thinking towards a constructivist approach to knowing and
communication and, consequently, to the cybernetical study of self-organization.
</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At the beginning of the sixties, before the foundation
of an American Society for Cybernetics was first contemplated, I was working
in Italy on a project in computational linguistics. The place where this
work was being done, was called <B>Centro di Cibernetica; </B>but since
I had only a dim notion of what cybernetics was supposed to be, I did not
think of myself as a cybernetician. The fact that I was there, was due
to a sequence of accidents which, in retrospect, could perhaps be regarded
the result of communication and control. At the time, they seemed more
like divine providence. That I was able to form my own research group in
Milan, a few years later, was also due to extraordinary circumstances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In those days, the <I>Information Sciences Directorate,
</I>a division of the <I>U.S.Air Force Office of Scientific Research, </I>was
sponsoring research in many different areas, some of which, like computational
linguistics, had only the vaguest connection with military objectives.
The Directorate was run by <B>Harold Wooster and Rowena Swanson, </B>two
outstanding individuals who were in many ways the opposite of what you
have come to expect of administrators, let alone military administrators.
They were both highly imaginative, widely read and cultivated, and enthusiastically
open to new and controversial ideas. They were ready to support a project
on sentence analysis based on ideas that were diametrically opposed to
Chomsky, who was just becoming the high priest of linguistics <SUP>2</SUP>.
In fact, we were analysing the relations that link words in sentences in
terms of conceptual elements, i.e., <I>semantically.<SUP>3</SUP> </I>And
we were developing a computer program that was beginning to do this, but
we still did not think of ourselves as cyberneticians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>When the Air Force funds for research abroad began to
dry up, Harold and Rowena suggested to some of their European proteges
that continuation of their work could be supported in the United States.
That is how I and the small team I had assembled decided to move to Athens,
Georgia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Athens - as Rowena put it - was to become &quot;the M.I.T.
of the South&quot;. <B>Warren McCulloch </B>was to spend two months of
the year in Athens, <B>Heinz von Foerster </B>was to run a large project
there, and we were to keep the home fires burning while the giants were
busy elsewhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>As it turned out, Heinz came on two brief visits, Warren
did not come at all, and at the end of 1969 our institute was wiped out
in Mr.Nixon's first economy drive. However, our work was apparently deemed
sufficiently cybernetic for me to be invited to join the American Society
for Cybernetics when it was founded. Had someone asked me why I considered
myself a <B>Cybernetician</B>, I would have been hard pressed to find a
plausible a reply.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A few years later, however, the work of <B>Gregory Bateson
</B>provided me with an answer. In one of his essays in <I>Steps to an
Ecology of Mind </I><SUP>4</SUP> he throws out the idea that the theory
of evolution is not a causal theory but a cybernetic one, because the &quot;effects
in this theory are not the result of causes, but are shaped by <I>constraints.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This fitted well with some observations I had made about
communication. Having grown up not in one, but <I>between </I>several languages,
gave me, as I later realized, a privileged position for thinking about
communication. For if you live between languages, you cannot help noticing
that you are operating between different sets of constraints. Hence I felt
I had at least <I>one </I>cybernetic root.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I had also come across <B>Claude Shannon's </B>theory,
and in the first two pages of his famous paper on <I>The mathematical theory
of communication </I></FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=+1>5</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=+0>,
he mentions that <I>meaning </I>does not travel from a sender to a receiver.
The only thing that travels are changes in some form of physical energy,
which he called &quot;signals&quot;. More important still, these changes
in energy are signals only to those who have associated them with a code
and are therefore able, as senders, to <I>encode </I>their meanings in
them and, as receivers, to <I>decode </I>them. Too often, in discussions
on communication, it is overlooked that the initial code of a particular
communication system cannot be established <I>within </I>that system but
has to be arranged by other means. The communication system we call &quot;natural
language&quot; is no different in that regard.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Until a child's vocabulary is rich enough to cover a variety
of concepts and conceptual relations, the meanings of new words cannot
be explained to that child. That is the first and most stringent reason
for the claim that each user of a language must build up meanings for him-
or herself. The meanings of words and phrases, consequently, are essentially
subjective - even if the constraints of social interaction then compel
individuals to adapt their meanings to fit a more or less common usage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The claim that a language user's semantic basis is subjective,
usually comes as a shock to anyone who has grown up with one native tongue.
They find it hard to believe because their language seems to be working
remarkably well in their interactions with others. If, however, you grow
up switching language several times a day because you live, as I did, among
native speakers of different languages, you gain a different perspective.
You cannot help realizing that the world a native speaker of, say, German
experiences and talks about is noticeably different from the world of a
native speaker of Italian; both their worlds are different again from those
of a Frenchmen or a Briton - let alone a native speaker of American English.
Even the everyday things a young man like myself might have been interested
in - things supposed to be common to all languages, like cars, mountains,
girls, and food are not quite the same in the experiential worlds of speakers
of different languages. Having noticed this, you also begin to suspect
that the concepts associated with words are not the same from person to
person in one and the same language.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This raises a troubling question: if concepts are not
fixed and universal, how does a child ever learn to <I>decode </I>the signals
of the language in which it grows up? The occasions in which adults explain
the meanings of words to their children are fairly rare. Even when they
do, there are only two ways they can do it: either they define what they
are talking about by using other words which the child already knows -
but this they cannot do at the beginning; or they simply point to what
the word &quot;refers&quot; to, i.e., they define by ostension.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is obviously this second way that may help the child
towards language acquisition. Ostensive definitions are usually considered
to be unproblematic. I think this is so because many of the people who
have been interested in studying language acquisition are native speakers
of <I>one </I>language, and therefore what is being pointed to seems perfectly
clear to them. You point at a thing, the child looks in the direction you
indicate, and the child sees the thing - because the thing is <I>there,
</I>just as you see it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I would like to suggest that this is a mistaken oversimplification.
What the adult sees and what the child sees are not at all the same thing.
In fact, it could not be the same thing, because for the adult the conceptions
of things are shaped by a variety of experiences the child has not yet
had. In principle, this is similar in the case of two adults, because one
person's experiences are never the same as another's. Thus, when you are
told that a particular word <I>means </I>&quot;that thing over there&quot;,
the word's meaning, <I>for you, </I>becomes what you see - and what you
see is not what the other sees. What you see is what you have learnt to
isolate in your own visual field, by handling things, pushing things, avoiding
things - in short, by interacting with your own experiential world, not
with anyone else's. And although, as a child, you may have learned the
ways you handle, push, and avoid things, to a large extent by copying what
you <I>think </I>the adults do among whom you are living, this, too, is
a subjective enterprise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Even monolinguals, when they grow up, sometimes discover
that what they thought those others were doing is not what <I>they </I>thought
they were doing. So they may become aware of discrepancies between their
use of certain words and other people's. But since they have to interact
not only with things but also with other speakers of the language, they
adapt their meanings as best they can to the meanings they believe others
to have in their minds. Quite often this leads to the feeling that one
&quot;sees things their way&quot;. But, as most of us discover, the need
for adaptation never ends. In fact, as you advance to old age, you realize
how much you are alone in your conceptual world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the strength of all this, <I>I </I>came to believe
that the meanings we attribute to words and phrases, and to whole speeches
and texts, are meanings, or built up of meanings, that we ourselves have
generated in our own experience. They are the result of &quot;self-regulation&quot;
- and the study of self-regulation is an integral part of cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This brings me to my second and, I think, far more important
cybernetic root. The person who, in this century, has laid the foundation
to the study of cognitive self-regulation, was <B>Jean Piaget. </B>His
often quoted maxim, <I>intelligence organizes the world by organizing itself,
</I>does not seem to have been taken very seriously by many of his expounders
and interpreters outside Geneva. I suppose it remains a rather abstract
statement until it is taken together with the other guiding principle that
pervades Piaget's work, the principle that knowledge has <I>an adaptive
function, not a representational one .</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Piaget did not start out as a psychologist or as a philosopher.
He started out as a biologist. When he speaks of &quot;adaptation&quot;
or &quot;adaptedness&quot;, he uses these terms in their original biological
sense. To understand him, one has to have a clear idea of what adaptation
meant to Darwin, Mark Baldwin, and others who influenced Piaget during
his formative years. This meaning is not at all abstract but practical.
Any organism that manages to <I>get by </I>the constraints set by its environment
is adapted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>When Piaget applied this notion to the activity of <I>knowing,
</I>he stepped out of the epistemological tradition of the Western world.
Knowledge was no longer expected to provide a &quot;true&quot; picture
of an absolute reality - something the sceptics of all ages had shown to
be impossible. Instead, it was to be seen as a means towards the organism's
<I>equilibration.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I shall not bore you with a detailed exposition of Piaget's
theory of equilibration.<SUP>6</SUP> But I do want to suggest that this
theory, too, is essentially a cybernetic theory. <B>Norbert Wiener </B>defined
cybernetics as &quot;control and communication in the animal and the machine&quot;.<SUP>7</SUP>
Let me first focus on the notion of control. For Piaget, knowledge is adaptive
insofar as it enables us to <I>control </I>experience and to maintain our
equilibrium. I hasten to add that &quot;equilibrium&quot; is a multileveled
concept that covers survival on the physical/biological level as well as
coherence and non-contradiction in the conceptual sphere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is one of the points where, I think, <B>Humberto
Maturana </B>and Piaget are in agreement. Maturana speaks of &quot;effective
action&quot; - and it is easy to translate &quot;effective action&quot;
into Piaget's terms as any action that maintains or restores the actor's
equilibrium.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And there is another connection that may be worth making.
<B>Bill Powers, </B>who has developed his own theory of control, frequently
points out that there are always two ways of counteracting an &quot;error
signal&quot;. On the one hand, an organism can try to act so that what
it perceives changes towards the reference it has chosen; on the other,
the organism can change the reference so that it fits what it perceives.<SUP>8</SUP>
In general terms, the reduction of an error signal is always a move towards
equilibrium. By the way, that there are two ways of reducing error or perturbation
is, of course, a feature psychotherapists know quite well. When something
upsets you, you may try to change either that thing or your conviction
that it is upsetting. - So much for the cybernetics of control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>That leaves the question of communication. Earlier I suggested
that we adjust the meaning we attribute to words when we discover that
we have it &quot;wrong&quot;. We adapt to the constraints imposed by the
way we think other speakers use language. But when we feel we are using
words &quot;right&quot;, when we are being &quot;under-stood&quot;, we
should not illude ourselves that we have come to <I>share </I>the meanings
of those others whom we believe we understand - we have merely avoided
noticeable discrepancies in the context of the particular situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This may sound like splitting hairs, but in my way of
thinking that split is of great importance. Compatibility does not imply
identity, it merely implies <I>viability </I>in the given circumstances.
That is why, after having used a word in a particular way for fifty or
more years, we may discover that it is not quite the way others are using
it - it is just that the circumstances in which we have so far used the
word happened to be such that they did not bring out any differences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If you accept this view, it radically changes the conventional
notion of &quot;understanding&quot; in linguistic communication. Rather
than believing that an idea, a chunk of &quot;information&quot;, or quite
generally, a specific conceptual structure has been communicated from one
person to another, we shall have to say that the listener or reader has
generated a conceptual structure which, as far as we can see at the moment,
seems to be <I>compatible </I>with the linguistic context, the situation
in which it was uttered, and the model we have been able to construct of
the other's experiential world. This compatibility is, again, a fitting
within constraints, and not a replica of what is in the other's mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>From my point of view, then, what Bateson remarked about
the theory of evolution is equally applicable to the <I>construction of
knowledge, </I>to our <I>acquisition of language, </I>and to any interaction
that we might want to call <I>communication. </I>None of these developments
or activities can be explained in terms of causes, but we can go a long
way towards explaining them in terms of constraints. For me, therefore,
the world in which we find ourselves living, is the world that we have
been able to build and maintain within the constraints we have so far experienced.
- What could be more cybernetic than this?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Hence, I do consider myself a cybernetician, because I
believe I have come to adopt a cybernetic way of thinking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In retrospect I realized that, without knowing it, I had
tended that way long before cybernetics was invented. I became aware of
this in the many conversations with students who were worrying about their
future and asked for advice. I heard myself telling them that it was far
more important to know what one did <I>not </I>want to do, than to have
detailed plans of what one did want to do. One day it dawned upon me that
this was plain cybernetic advice: <I>It is more useful to specify constraints
rather than goals. - </I>And then I explained it by adding that in one's
teens or twenties one usually has already discovered a number of things
that one cannot stand, whereas it is quite impossible to foresee what,
ten or twenty years later, will provide the satisfactions needed to maintain
one's equilibrium.</FONT></P>
