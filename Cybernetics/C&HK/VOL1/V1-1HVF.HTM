<I>Ethics and Second-order Cybernetics<SUP>1</SUP></I></H3>

<P><I>We are grateful to director F. Dauzat of the E.S.F. &eacute;diteur
to have been given the rights to publish the English version of this speech
which is originalle published in: &quot;Syst&egrave;me, &eacute;thique
et perspec-tives en th&eacute;rapie familiale&quot;, sous la direction

Octobre 91.</I> </P>

<P><B>Ladies and Gentlemen!</B> </P>

<P>I am touched by the generosity of the organizers of this conference
who not only invited me to come to your glorious city of Paris, but also
gave me the honor of opening the Plenary sessions with my presentation.
And I am impressed by the ingenuity of our organizers, who suggested to
me the title of my presentation. They wanted me to address myself to &quot;Ethics
and Second-Order Cybernetics&quot;. </P>

<P>To be honest, I would never have dared to propose such an outrageous
title, but I must say that I am delighted that this title was chosen for
me. Before I left California for Paris others asked me, full of envy, &quot;What
am I going to do in Paris? What will I talk about?&quot; When I answered
&quot;I shall talk about Ethics and Second-order cybernetics&quot; almost
all of them looked at me in bewilderment and asked &quot;What is second-order
cybernetics?&quot; as if there were no questions about ethics. </P>

<P>I am relieved when people ask me about second order cybernetics and
not about ethics, because it is so much easier to talk about cybernetics
than it is to talk about ethics. In fact, it is impossible to talk about
ethics. But let me explain that later, and let me now say a few words about
cybernetics, and, of course, about cybernetics of cybernetics, or second-order
cybernetics<SUP>2</SUP> . </P>

<P>As you all know, cybernetics arises when effectors, say, a motor, an
engine, our muscles, etc., are connected to a sensory organ which, in turn,
acts with its signals upon the effectors. It is this circular organization
which sets cybernetic systems apart from others that are not so organized.
Here is Norbert Wiener, who re-introduced the term &quot;Cybernetics&quot;
into scientific discourse. He observed: The behaviour of such systems may
be interpreted as directed to the attainment of a goal<SUP>3</SUP>&quot;.
That is, it looks so as if these systems pursued a purpose! That sounds
very bizarre indeed! </P>

<P>But let me give you other paraphrases of what cybernetics is all about
by invoking the spirit of women and men who rightly could be called the
mamas and papas of cybernetic thought and action. </P>

<P>First, here is Margaret Mead, whose name is, I am sure, familiar to
all of you. In one of her addresses to the American Society of Cybernetics
she said <SUP>4</SUP>: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;As an anthropologist, I have been interested in the effects that
the theories of Cybernetics have within our society, I am <B>not</B> refering
to computers or to the electronic revolution as a whole, or to the end
of dependence on script for knowledge, or to the way that dress has succeeded
the mimeographing machine as a form of communication among the dissenting
young.&quot; Let me repeat that: &quot;I am <B>not </B>refering to the
way that <B>dress</B> has succeeded the mimeographing machine as a form
of communication among the dissenting young.&quot; And then she continues:
&quot;I specifically want to consider the significance of the set of cross-disciplinary
ideas which we first called &quot;feed-back&quot; and then called &quot;theological
mechanisms&quot; and then called it &quot;cybernetics&quot; - a form of
cross-disciplinary thought which made it possible for members of many disciplines
to communicate with each other easily in a language which all could understand&quot;.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And here is the voice of her third husband, the epistemologist, anthropologist,
cybernetician, and, as some say, the papa of family therapy, Gregory Bateson:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Cybernetics is a branch of mathematics dealing with problems of
control, recursiveness and information.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And here the organizational philosopher and managerial wizard Stafford
Beer: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Cybernetics is the science of effective organization.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And, finally, here the poetic reflection of &quot;Mister Cybernetics&quot;,
as we fondly call him, the cybernetician's cybernetician, Gordon Pask:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Cybernetics is the science of defensible metaphors.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It seems that cybernetics is many different things to many different
people <SUP>5</SUP>, but this is because of the richness of its conceptual
base. And this is, I believe, very good, other-wise cybernetics would become
a somewhat boring exercise. However, all of those perspectives arise from
one central theme, and that is that of circularity. </P>

<P>When, perhaps a half century ago, the fecundity of this concept was
seen, it was sheer euphoria to philosophize, epistemologize, and theorize
about its consequences, its ramification into various fields, and its unifying
power. </P>

<P>While this was going on, something strange evolved among the philosophers,
the epistemologists and the theoreticians: they began to see themselves
included in a larger circularity, maybe within the circularity of their
family, or that of their society and culture, or being included in a circularity
of even cosmic proportions. What appears to us today most natural to see
and to think, was then not only hard to see, it was even not allowed to
think! </P>

<P>Why? </P>

<P>Because it would violate the basic principle of scientific discourse
which demands the separation of the observer from the observed. It is the
principle of objectivity: The properties of the observer shall not enter
the description of his observations. </P>

<P>I gave this principle here in its most brutal form, to demonstrate its
non-sensicality: if the properties of the observer, namely, to observe
and to describe, are eliminated, there is nothing left: no observation,
no description. </P>

<P>However, there was a justification for adhering to this principle, and
this justification was fear. Fear that paradoxes would arise when the observers
were allowed to enter the universe of their observations. And you know
the threat of paradoxes: to steal their way into a theory is like having
the cloven-hoofed foot of the Devil stuck in the door of orthodoxy. Clearly,
when cyberneticians were thinking of partnership in the circularity of
observing and communicating, they were entering the forbidden land: </P>

<P>In the general case of circular closure A implies B; B implies C; and
- O; Horror! - C impies A! </P>

<P>Or in the reflexive case! A implies B; and O! Shock! - B implies A!
</P>

<P>And now Devil's cloven-hoofed foot in its purest form, in the form of
self-reference: A implies A! -Outrage!- </P>

<P>I would like to invite you now to come with me into the land where it
is not forbidden, but where one is even encouraged to speak about oneself
(what else can one do anyway?). </P>

<P>This turn from looking at things out there to looking at looking itself,
arose - I think - from significant advances in neurophysiology and neuropsychiatry.
It appeared that one could now dare to ask the question of how the brain
works: one could dare to write a theory of the brain. It may be argued
that over the centuries since Aristotle, physicians and philosophers again
and again developed theories of the brain. So, what's new about the efforts
of today's cyberneticians? </P>

<P>What is new is the profound insight that it needs a brain to write a
theory of the brain. From this follows that a theory of the brain, that
has any aspirations for completeness, has to account for the writing of
this theory. And even more fascinating, the<B> writer</B> of this theory
has to account for her- or himself. Translated onto the domain of cybernetics:
the cybernetician, by entering his own domain, has to account for his own
activity; cybernetics becomes cybernetics of cybernetics, or second-order
cybernetics. </P>

<P><B>Ladies and Gentlemen</B> </P>

<P>This perception represents a fundamental change not only in the way
we conduct science, but also how we perceive of teaching, of learning,
of the therapeutic process, of organizational management, and so on and
so forth; and - I would say - of how we perceive relationships in our daily
life. </P>

<P>One may see this fundamental epistemo-logical change if one considers
oneself first to be an independent observer who watches the world go by;
or if one considers oneself to be a participant actor in the drama of mutual
interaction, of the give and take in the circularity of human relations.
</P>

<P>In the first case, because of my independence, I can tell others how
to think and to act; &quot;Thou shalt...&quot;, &quot;Thou shalt not...&quot;:
This is the origin of moral codes. </P>

<P>In the second case, because of my interdependence, I can only tell to
myself how to think and to act: &quot;I shall...&quot;, &quot;I shall not...&quot;:
This is the origin of ethics. </P>

<P>This was the easy part of my presentation. Now comes the difficult part:
I am supposed to reflect about ethics. </P>

<P>How to go about this? Where to begin? </P>

<P>In my search for a beginning I came across the lovely poem by Eveline
Rey and Bernard Prieur that embellishes the first page of our program.
Let me read to you the first few lines: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;You just said Ethics? Soon whispers grow into rumour. Roses show
nothing but thorns. The topic may be burning, it's also up to date&quot;.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Let me begin with the thorns, and I hope a rose will emerge. </P>

<P>The thorns I begin with are Ludwig Wittgenstein's reflections upon ethics
in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. If I were to provide a title for
this tractatus, I would call it Tractatus Ethico-Philosophicus. However,
I am not going to defend this choice, I would rather tell you what prompts
me to refer to Wittgenstein's reflections in order to present my own. </P>

<P>I am refering to point Number 6 in his Tractatus where he discusses
the general form of propositions. Almost at the end of this discussion
he turns to the problem of values in the world and their expression in
propositions. In his famous point Number 6.421 he comes to a conclusion
which I will read to you in the original German<SUP>6</SUP>: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Es ist klar, dass sich Ethik nicht aussprechen laesst&quot;. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I wish I would know a French translation. I only know two English translations
which are both incorrect. Therefore I will give you my translation into
English, with my conviction that the simultaneous translators will do a
superb job of giving Wittgenstein's point in French. Here is my English
version of 6.421: &quot;It is clear that ethics cannot be articulated&quot;.
</P>

<P>Now you understand why I said before: &quot;My beginning will be thorns&quot;.
Here is an International Congress on Ethics, and the first speaker says
something to the effect that it is impossible to speak about ethics. But
please be patient for a moment. I quoted Wittgenstein's thesis in isolation,
therefore it is not yet clear what he wanted to say. Fortunately, the next
point 6.422, which I will read in a moment, provides a larger context for
6.421. To prepare you for what you are going to hear, you should remember
that Wittgenstein was a Viennese. So am I. Therefore there is a kind of
underground understanding which I sense, you Parisians will share with
us Viennese. Let me try. </P>

<P>Here is now point 6.422 in the English translation by Pears and McGuiness:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;When an ethical law of the form &quot;Thou shalt...&quot; is laid
down, one's first thought is &quot;And what if I do not do it?&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>When I read this, my first thought was that not everybody will share
that first thought with Wittgenstein. I think here speaks his cultural
background. </P>

<P>Let me continue with Wittgenstein: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;It is clear, however, that ethics has nothing to do with punishment
and reward in the usual sense of the terms. Nevertheless, there must indeed
be some kind of ethical reward and punishment, but they must reside in
the action itself.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;They must reside in the action itself!&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You may remember, we came across such self-referential notions earlier
with the example &quot;A implies A&quot; and its recursive relatives of
second-order cybernetics. Can we take a hint from these comments for how
to go about reflecting about ethics and, at the same time, adhering to
Wittgenstein's criterion? I think we can. I for myself, try to follow the
following rule: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;For any discourse I may have, say, in science, philosophy, epistemology,
therapy, et cetera, to master the use of my language so that ethics is
implicit.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>What do I mean by that? I mean by that to let language and action ride
on an underground river of ethics, and to see to it that one is not thrown
off, so that ethics does not become explicit, and so that language does
not degenerate into moralizations. </P>

<P>How can one accomplish this? How can one hide ethics from all eyes and
still let her determine language and action? </P>

<P>Fortunately, Ethics has two sisters who allow her to remain unseen,
because they create for us a visible framework, a tangible tissue within
which, and upon which, we may weave the Gobelins of our life. And who are
these two sisters? </P>

<P>One is Metaphysics, the other Dialogics. </P>

<P>My program now is to talk about these two ladies, and how they manage
to allow Ethics become manifest without becoming explicit. </P>

<P><B>Metaphysics</B> </P>

<P>Let me first talk about Metaphysics. In order to let you see at once
the delightful ambiguity that surrounds her, let me quote from a superb
article on &quot;The Nature of Metaphysics&quot; by the British scholar
W.H.Walsh<SUP>7</SUP>: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Almost everything in metaphysics is controversial and it is therefore
not surprising that there is little agreement among those who call themselves
metaphysicians about what precisely it is they are attempting.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>When I invoke today Metaphysics, I do not seek agreement with anybody
else about her Nature. This is because I want to say precisely what it
is when we become metaphysicians. I say we become metaphysician whenever
we decide upon in principle undecidable questions. There are indeed among
propositions, proposals, problems, questions, those that are decidable,
and those that are in principle undecidable. </P>

<P>Here, for instance, is a decidable question: &quot;Is the number 3.396.714
divisible by 2?&quot; It will take you less than 2 seconds to decide that
indeed this number is divisible by 2. The interesting thing here is that
it will take you exactly the same short time to decide this question, if
the number has not 7, but 7000 or 7 million digits. </P>

<P>Of course I could invent questions that are slightly more difficult,
for instance: &quot;Is 3.396.714 divisible by three?&quot;, or more difficult
ones. But there are also problems that are extraordinary difficult to decide,
some of them having been posed more than 200 years ago and have still not
been answered. Think of Fermat's &quot;Last Theorem&quot; to which the
most brilliant heads have put their brilliant minds and have not yet come
up with an answer. </P>

<P>Or think of Goldbach's &quot;Conjecture&quot; which sounds so simple
that it seems a proof cannot be too far away: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;All even numbers can be composed as the sum of two primes&quot;.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For example: 12 is the sum of the two prime numbers 5 and 7; or 20 =
17+3; or 24 = 13+11; and so on and so forth. So far, no counterexample
to Goldbach's conjecture has been found. And even if all further tests
would not refute Goldbach, it still would remain a conjecture, until a
sequence of mathematical steps is found that decides in favour of his good
sense of numbers. There is a justification for not giving up but to continue
the search for finding a sequence of steps that would prove Goldbach. It
is that the problem is posed in a framework of logico-mathematical relations
which guarantees that one can climb from any node of this complex crystal
of connections to any other node. </P>

<P>One of the most remarkable examples of such a crystal of thoughts is
Bertrand Russell's and Alfred North Whitehead's monumental Principia Mathematica
which they wrote over a period of 10 years between 1900 and 1910. This
magnum opus of 3 volumes and more than 1500 pages was to esta-blish once
and for all a conceptual machinery for flawless deductions. A conceptual
machinery that would contain no ambiguities, no contradictions and no undecidables<SUP>8</SUP>.
</P>

<P>Nevertheless, in 1931, Kurt G&ouml;del, then 25 years of age, published
an article whose significance goes far beyond the circles of logicians
and mathematicians<SUP>9</SUP>. The title of this article I will give now
in English: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;On formally undecidable propositions in the Principia Mathematica
and related systems.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>What G&ouml;del does in his paper is to demonstrate that logical systems,
even like those so carefully constructed by Russell and Whitehead, are
not immune against undecidables to sneak in. </P>

<P>However, we do not need to go to Russell, Whitehead, G&ouml;del, or
to other giants, to learn about in principle undecidable questions, we
can easily find them all around. For instance, the question about the origin
of the universe is one of those in principle undecidable questions: nobody
was there to watch it. Moreover, this becomes apparent by the many different
answers that are given to this question. Some say it was a single act of
creation some 4 or 5000 years ago; others say there was never a beginning
and there will never be an end, because the universe is a system in perpetual
dynamic equilibrium; then there are those who claim that approximately
10 or 20 billion years ago the universe came into being with a &quot;Big
Bang&quot;, whose faint remnants one is able to hear over large radio antennas;
but I am inclined to trust most Chuang Tse's report, because he is the
oldest and was therefore the closest to this event. He says: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Heaven does nothing; his nothing-doing is dignity;<BR>
Earth does nothing; her nothing-doing is rest;<BR>
From the union of these two nothing-doings arise all action<BR>
And all things are brought forth.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I could go on and on with other examples, because I have not told you
yet what the Burmese, the Australians, the Eskimos, the Bushmen, the Ibos,
etc., would tell us about their origins. In other words, tell me how the
universe came about, and I will tell you who you are. </P>

<P>I hope I have made the distinction between decidable and in principle
undecidable questions sufficiently clear, so that I can present you with
a proposition I call the &quot;metaphysical postulate&quot;<SUP>10</SUP>.
Here it is: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Only <B>those</B> questions that are in principle undecidable,
we can decide.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Why? </P>

<P>Simply because the decidable questions are already decided by the choice
of the framework in which we are asked, and by the choice of rules of how
to connect what we call &quot;the question&quot; with what we may take
for an &quot;answer&quot;. In some cases it may go fast, in others it may
take a long, long time, but ultimately we will arrive, after a sequence
of compelling logical steps, at an irrefutable answer: a definite Yes,
or a definite No. </P>

<P>But we are under no compulsion, not even under that of logic, when we
decide upon in principle undecidable question. </P>

<P>This is the good news, American journalists would say. Now comes the
bad news. </P>

<P>With this freedom of choice we are now responsible for whatever we choose.
For some this freedom of choice is a gift from heaven. For others such
responsibility is an unbearable burden: How can one escape it? How can
one avoid it? How can one pass it on to somebody else? </P>

<P>With much ingenuity and imagination mechanisms were contrived by which
one could bypass this awesome burden. With hierarchies entire institutions
have been built where it is impossible to localize responsibility. Everyone
in such a system can say&quot;: I was told to do X.&quot; </P>

<P>On the political stage we hear more and more the phrase of Pontius Pilate:
I have no choice but X.&quot; In other words &quot;Don't make me responsible
for X, blame others.&quot; This phrase apparently replaces: &quot;Among
the many choices I had, I decided on X.&quot; </P>

<P>I mentioned objektivity before, and I mention it here again as another
popular device of avoiding responsiblility. </P>

<P>As, you may remember, objectivity requires that the properties of the
observer shall not enter the description of his observations. With the
essence of observing, namely the processes of cognition, being removed,
the observer is reduced to a copying machine, and the notion of responsibility
has been successfully juggled away. </P>

<P>However, Pontius Pilate, hierarchies, objectivity, and other devices,
are all derivations of a decision that has been made on a pair of in principle
undecidable questions. Here is the decisive pair! </P>

<P>Am I apart from the universe? That is, whenever I look I am looking
as through a peephole upon an unfolding universe. </P>

<P>Or: </P>

<P>Am I part of the universe? That is, whenever I act, I am changing myself
and the universe as well. </P>

<P>Whenever I reflect upon these two alternatives, I am surprised again
and again by the depth of the abyss that separates the two fundamentally
different worlds that can be created by such choice: </P>

<P>Either to see myself as a citizen of an independent universe, whose
regularities, rules and customs I may eventually discover, or to see myself
as the participant of a conspiracy, whose customs, rules, and regulations
we are now inventing. </P>

<P>Whenever I speak to those who have made their decision to be either
discoverers or inventors, I am impressed again and again by the fact that
neither of them realizes that they have ever made that decision. Moreover,
when challenged to justify their position, a conceptual framework is constructed
that, it turns out, is itself the result of a decision upon an in principle
undecidable question. </P>

<P>It seems that I am telling you a detective story, but keeping silent
about who is the good guy and who is the bad guy, or who is sane or who
is insane, or who is right and who is wrong. Since these are in principle
undecidable questions, it is for each of us to make this decision and to
take the responsibility for it. There is a murderer. I submit it is unknowable
whether he is or was insane. The only thing we know is what I say, what
you say, or what the expert says he is. And what I say, what you say, and
what the expert says about his sanity or insanity, it is my, it is your,
it is the experts responsibility. Again the point here is not the question
&quot;Who is right and who is wrong&quot;. This is an in principle undecidable
question. The point here is freedom; freedom of choice; it is Jos&eacute;
Ortega y Gasset's point<SUP>11</SUP>: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Man does not have a nature, but a history. Man is no thing, but
a drama. His life is something that has to be chosen, made up as he goes
along, and a human consists in that choice and invention. Each human being
is the novelist of himself, and though he may choose between being an original
writer and a plagiarist, he cannot escape choosing. He is condemned to
be free.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You may have become suspicious of me qualifying all questions as being
in principle undecidable questions. This is by no means the case. I was
once asked the question, of how the inhabitants of such different worlds
as I sketched them before, the inhabitants of the world they discover,
and the inhabitants of a world they invent, how can they ever live together?
There is no problem to answer that. The discoverers will most likely become
astronomers, physicists and engineers; the inventors family therapists,
poets and biologists. And for all of them living together will be no problem
either, as long as the discoverers discover inventors, and the inventors
invent discoverers. Should there difficulties develop, fortunately, we
have this full house of family therapist who may help to bring sanity to
the human family. </P>

<P>I have a dear friend who grew up in Marakesh. The house of his family
stood on the street that divides the Jewish and the Arabic quarters. As
a boy he played with all the others, listened to what they thought and
said, and learned of their fundamentally different views. When I asked
him once: who was right? he said , they are both right. </P>

<P>&quot;But this cannot be&quot;, I argued from an Aristotelian platform,
&quot;Only one of them can have the truth!&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;The problem is not truth&quot; he answered, &quot;The problem
is trust.&quot; </P>

<P>I understood: the problem is understanding; the problem is understanding
understanding; the problem is making decisions upon in principle undecidable
questions. </P>

<P>At that point Metaphysics appeared and asked her younger sister, Ethics:
&quot;What would you recommend that I should bring back to my protoges,
the metaphysicians, whether or not they call themselves such?&quot;, and
Ethics answered: Tell them they should always try to act so as to increase
the number of choices; yes, increase the number of choices!&quot; </P>

<P><B>Dialogics</B> </P>

<P>Now I would like to turn to Ethics' sister Dialogics. What are the means
at her disposal so that through them Ethics can manifest herself without
becoming explicit. I think, you may have already guessed it already, it
is, of course, language. I am not talking here about language in the sense
of the noises that are produced by pushing air past our vocal chords, or
language in the sense of grammars, syntax, semantics, semiotics, and the
whole machinery of phrases, verb-phrases, noun-phrases, deep structure,
etc. When I talk here about language, I talk about Language, the dance.
Very much so when we say &quot;It needs two to Tango&quot;, I am saying,
&quot;It needs two to Language&quot;. </P>

<P>When it comes to language, the dance, you, the family therapists are,
of course, the masters, while I can only speak as an amateur. Since &quot;amateur&quot;
comes from &quot;Amour&quot;, you know at once that I love to dance this
dance. </P>

<P>In fact, the little I know to dance this dance I learned from you. My
first lesson was when I was invited to sit in the observation room and
to watch through the one-way mirror a therapeutic session in progress with
a family of four. At one moment my colleagues had to leave, and I was by
myself. I was curious as to what I would see when I could not hear what
was said, so I turned the sound off. </P>

<P>I recommend to you to make this experiment yourself. Perhaps you will
be as fascinated as I was. What I saw then, the silent pantomime, the parting
and closing of lips, the body movements, the boy who only once stopped
biting his nails, ... what I saw then were the dance steps of language,
the dance steps alone, without the disturbing effects of the music. Later
I heard from the therapist that this seeeion was vey successful indeed.
</P>

<P>What magic, I thought, must sit in the noises these people produced
by pushing air past their vocal chords, and by parting and closing their
lips. </P>

<P>Therapy! What magic indeed! </P>

<P>And to think that the only medicine at your disposal are the dance steps
of language and its accompanying music. </P>

<P>Language! What magic indeed! </P>

<P>It is left to the naive to believe that magic can be explained. Magic
can not be explained. Magic can only be practiced, as you well know. </P>

<P>Reflecting upon the magic of language is similar to reflecting upon
a theory of the brain. As much as one needs a brain to reflect upon a theory
of the brain, one needs the magic of language to reflect upon the magic
of language. It is the magic of those notions that need themselves to come
into being. They are of second order. </P>

<P>It is also the way language protects itself against explanation by always
speaking about itself: There is a word for language, namely, &quot;language&quot;;
there is word for word, namely &quot;word&quot;. If you don't know what
&quot;word&quot; means, you can look it up in a dictionary. I did that.
I found it to be an &quot;utterance&quot;? I looked it up in the dictionary.
The dictionary said it means: &quot;to express through words&quot;. </P>

<P>So we are back where we started. Circularity: A implies A. </P>

<P>But this is not the only way language protects itself against explanation.
In order to confuse her explorer she always runs on two different tracks.
If you chase language up one track, she jumps to the other. If you follow
her there, she is back on the first. </P>

<P>What are these two tracks? </P>

<P>The one track is the track of appearance. It runs through the land that
appears to be stretched out before us: the land we are looking at as through
a peephole. </P>

<P>The other track is the track of function. It runs through the land that
is as much part of us as we are part of it; the land that functions like
an extension of our body. </P>

<P>When language is on the track of appearance it is monologue. There are
the noises produced by pushing air past vocal chords, there are the words,
the grammars, the syntax, the well-formed sentences. Along with these noises
goes the denotative pointings. Point to a table, make the noise &quot;table&quot;;
point to a chair, make the noise &quot;chair&quot;. </P>

<P>Sometimes it does not work. Margaret Mead learned fast colloquuial language
of many tribes by pointing to things and waiting for the appropriate noises.
She told me that once she came to a tribe, pointed to different things,
but always got the same noises &quot;chumulu&quot;. A primitive language
she thought, only one word! Later she learned &quot;chu mulu&quot; means
&quot;pointing with finger&quot;. </P>

<P>When language switches to the track of function it is dialogic. There
are of course these noises; some of them may sound like &quot;table&quot;,
some others like &quot;chair&quot;, but there need not be any tables or
chairs, because nobody is pointing at tables or chairs. These noises are
invitations to the other to make some dance steps together. The noises
&quot;table&quot; and &quot;chair&quot; bring to resonance those strings
in the mind of the other which, when brought to vibration, would produce
noises like &quot;table&quot; and &quot;chair&quot;: language in its function
is connative. </P>

<P>In its appearance, language is descriptive. When you tell your story,
you tell it as it was: the magnificent ship, the ocean, the big sky, and
the flirt you had, that made the whole trip a delight. </P>

<P>But for whom do you tell it? That's the wrong question. The right question
is: With whom are you going to dance your story, so that your partner will
float with you over the decks of your ship, will smell the salt of the
ocean, will let the soul expand over the sky, and there will be a flash
of jealousy when you come to the point of your flirt. </P>

<P>In its function, language is constructive, because nobody knows the
source of your story. Nobody knows and ever will know how it was: because
as it was is gone forever. </P>

<P>You remember Ren&eacute; Descartes, as he was sitting in his study,
not only doubting that he was sitting in his study, but also doubting his
existence. He asked himself &quot;Am I, or am I not&quot;?: &quot;Am I
or am I not&quot;? He answered this rhetorical question with the solipistic
monologue &quot;Je pense, donc je suis&quot;, or in the famous Latin version
&quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot;. As Descartes knew very well, this is language
in its appearance, otherwise he would not have quickly published his insight
for the benefit of others in his &quot;Discourse de la m&eacute;thode&quot;.
Since he understood the function of language as well, in all fairness,
he should have exclaimed: &quot;Je pense, donc nous sommes&quot;, Cogito
ergo sumus&quot;; or &quot;I think, therfore we are!&quot; </P>

<P>In its appearance, the language I speak is my language. It makes me
aware of myself: this is the root of consciousness. </P>

<P>In its function, my language reaches out for the other: this is the
root of conscience. And this is where Ethics invisibly manifests itself
through dialogue. Permit me to read to you what Martin Buber says in the
last few lines of his book &quot;Das Problem des Menschen&quot;<SUP>12</SUP>:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Contemplate the human with the human, and you will see the dynamic
duality, the human essence, together: here is the giving and the receiving,
here the agressive and the defensive power, here the quality of searching
and of responding, always both in one, mutually complementing in alternating
action, demonstrating together what it is: human. Now you can turn to the
single one and you recognize him as human for his potential of relating.
We may come closer to answering the question: what is human? When we come
to understand him as being in whose dialogic, in his mutually present two-getherness,
the encounter of the one with the other is realized and recognized at all
times.&quot; </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Since I cannot add anything to Buber's words, this is all I can say
about ethics, and about second-order cybernetics. Thank you very much.
