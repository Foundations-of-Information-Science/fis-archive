<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>My case is to present an argument that school -and social science -
should aim at elicting the ability of reflection, of taking responsibility.
That this calls for work and development within the hermeneutic tradition,
where what we call action-oriented research represents one attempt. Where
we do need an individual psychology that accounts for our ability to make
distinctions and that understands our sensory attributes as active perceptual
systems permitting us to build coherent histories and lives. Where we do
need organizations that give room for the active use of these abilities.
