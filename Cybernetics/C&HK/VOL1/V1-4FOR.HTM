<p>A CALL FOR DISCUSSION</p>

<p>In this issue we publish a philosophical critique of some of
the basic constructivistic positions within second order
cybernetics by David Johnson. It is my hope that this paper will
initiate a fruitful debate about these major issues which also
are being discussed in other fora.</p>

<p>The journal is now open for shorter comments under a section
called &quot;Discussion&quot;. The first participant is Ernst von
Glasersfeld who in this issue addresses several questions to
Johnsons paper.</p>

<p>Lars Qvortrup gives an historical and critical exposition of
the highlights of the debate on the concept of information with
reference to the most important positions and works from Shannon
to Luhmann.</p>

<p>Hugh Gash writes about the usefulness of Bateson's concepts of
learning in understanding prejudice, and reports social
experiments on how to change prejudice among schoolchildren.</p>

<p>In the Praxis section Søren Brier writes about how to use
conversational ethics in companies and institutions to create
fruitful solutions to the cultural and environmental problems
even on a global scale.</p>

<p>NEWS FROM THE EDITOR</p>

<p>Economically the journal has just survived its first year
thanks to a lot of unpaid work, economical support from the ASC,

Larsen for photos of Bruno Kjær's artworks to the first issue
and to Thomas Pedersen &amp; Poul Pedersen for photos of Steffen
Tasts artworks in this issue.</p>
