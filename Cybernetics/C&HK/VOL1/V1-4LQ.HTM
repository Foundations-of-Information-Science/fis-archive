<I>The Controversy over the Concept of Information. <BR>
An Overview and a Selected and Annotated Bibliography</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the present article, I will summarize the current controversy
over the concept of information by reconstructing the discussion, beginning
in the 1940s, of this seemingly innocent, but significant word. It <I>seems</I>
to be innocent, because everybody talks about information, in-formation
technology and an information socie-ty. It <I>is</I> however significant,
because its definition implies a whole theory of knowledge. My main aim
is to reconstruct the implicit structure of this discussion by identifying
a number of characteristic definitions of information, thus providing an
overview of the field, trying to avoid simplistic notions of the concept
of information. The paper is supposed to act as a tool for continuing the
discussion. Therefore, a selected and annotated bibliography is added as
the final section. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Information - A Tricky Concept</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>What, then <I>is</I> the problem regarding the concept
of information? What makes is so tricky? The basic problem seems to be
that since the 1940s it has aimed at becoming a natural science con-cept,
an objective thing, a substance, a &quot;Ding an sich&quot;. But every
time it has been close to becoming a decent, objective concept it has been
caught up by its fate that information is a concept which implies a human
subject. Information isn't just information in itself; it only becomes
information when it is information <I>to somebody,</I> i.e. as a mental
construction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, there are many potential definitions of information.
At the one end, information may be defined as a thing. At the other end,
information may be defined as a psychic construction. Within this continuum,
logically speaking, it should be posssible to identify four concepts of
information:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Firstly, information may be defined as something (a thing
or a substance) existing in the ex-ternal world like heat, electricity,
etc. Thus, information may be defined as something identifiable in the
real world, i.e. as <I>a difference</I> in reality.</FONT></P>
