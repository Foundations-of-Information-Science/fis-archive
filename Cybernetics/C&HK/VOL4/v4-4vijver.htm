        <!--mstheme--> <font face="garamond, times new roman, times"><p><font
        size="3">Some time ago, my little daughter, of four years
        old, told me that she was at school learning about
        animals. I asked her: &quot;What animals?&quot;, and she
        replied: &quot;All animals!&quot;. Of course, I could not
        resist doing a small &quot;Piagetian&quot; experiment in
        asking her whether we, human beings, are also animals.
        &quot;Well, sure!&quot;, she said without any hesitation.
        As a philosopher, I was astonished. Is it then so evident
        that we humans are animals? What made my daughter so
        naturally and deeply convinced of it? Is it a
        &quot;fact&quot; that we are animals, something to be
        taken &quot;at face value&quot;? Or was my astonishment
        rather an indication of the distance that separates
        philosophical reflection from those things to be taken
        &quot;at face value&quot;?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">At the moment, I don't have any
        straightforward answers to these questions, but I can say
        that Jesper Hoffmeyer's book, <i>Signs of Meaning in the
        Universe</i>, provoked a quite similar effect in me.
        Natural agreement - of course, we are animals! - was on
        my part accompanied by a typical philosophical
        astonishment precisely about that agreement itself - why
        &quot;of course&quot;?. In a sense, that is what the
        present book is all about: about our being animals and
        about the ways of agreement and disagreement that
        accompany the living. Ultimately, the book is about a new
        understanding of biology. But I think that just saying
        this would be too much of a short-cut here, so I will
        attempt to explain in some more detail how Jesper
        Hoffmeyer leads us from the fact of being alive towards
        our specifically human ways of agreement and
        disagreement.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I am not sure that an overview of the
        contents of the book will be of much clarification for
        the reader. What can be the use of a conventional
        presentation of a clearly non-conventional, even poetic
        book? The choice of chapter headings already indicates
        this. The first chapter is called &quot;Signifying. On
        lumps in nothingness&quot;, and is followed by chapters
        on &quot;Forgetting&quot;, &quot;Repeating&quot;,
        &quot;Inventing&quot;, &quot;Opening Up&quot;,
        &quot;Defining&quot;, &quot;Connecting&quot;,
        &quot;Sharing&quot;, &quot;Uniting&quot;, and
        &quot;Healing&quot;. With these headings, the author
        draws conceptual contours of a universe populated by
        living, actively striving beings, which are, as living
        beings, inevitably making sense of their surroundings.
        Understanding the living, including our own place in the
        universe, means to Hoffmeyer understanding the multiple
        ways of signifying, remembering, forgetting, repeating
        and inventing, ... characteristic of living systems. It
        means, in the first place, taking account of the
        implications of the code-like organization of the living.
        If there were no code, there would be no &quot;lumps in
        nothingness&quot;, no &quot;nature taking habits&quot;,
        no possibility of remembering nor of forgetting. But in
        the second place, it means asking the question of the
        origins of these &quot;lumps in nothingness&quot;, the
        &quot;someone&quot; behind it: &quot;(...) in a sense
        what or who this 'someone' might be is exactly the
        question posed in this book. Who is capable of making
        'lumps in nothingness'? When did it start? And to what
        did it lead?&quot; (p. 10).</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">So, <i>Signs of Meaning in the Universe</i>
        finds its starting point in our being alive - <i>a
        biological evolutionary viewpoint</i> -, and it
        highlights the important questions in that regard: What
        is it to be a living being? What is implied in the
        acknowledgment of being alive? What is the role of
        codification in the organization of the living? How did
        we, humans, evolve from other types of living systems? In
        what sense are we similar and/or different from other
        animals?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In addition, however, the book
        questions the particular types of &quot;meaningful&quot;
        relationships living systems, <i>qua</i> living systems,
        can entertain with their environments. The <i>semiotic</i>
        viewpoint brings the author to investigate the sources
        and types of interaction we call meaningful: is there
        meaning &quot;in the universe&quot;, or do we construct,
        through our interactions, a meaningful relationship with
        it?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In answering those questions, the
        author associates with Peirce's semiotic viewpoint,
        commonly called relational or triadic: if there are signs
        of meaning in the universe, they are always signs <i>for</i>
        someone, never signs as such: &quot;A sign (...) is
        something which stands for something to somebody in some
        respect or capacity&quot; (Peirce, cited p. 19). Signs do
        stand <i>for</i> something, but only if they also stand
        for something <i>to</i> somebody. In other words, the
        sign-function has to be, implicitly or explicitly,
        recognized by someone; some system has in some sense to
        &quot;realize&quot; the sign-function. The Peircean
        sign-conception is committed to a universe populated by
        dynamical, even subjective systems, actively taking part
        or engaged in something.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Of course, it is not sufficient to
        state, abstractly, the necessity of a triadic
        sign-conception. Various questions remain unanswered,
        among which are: What exactly makes a relational account
        relational? What makes systems able to act relationally
        or interactively, so as to recognize the sign-function?
        Or in other words: what are the (systemic) conditions for
        the emergence of the sign-function? Is it a matter of
        inheritance - vertical semiosis, as Hoffmeyer calls it -,
        or rather a question of genesis and learning - horizontal
        semiosis? What is the difference between systems
        subjected to the &quot;sign-logic&quot; - those systems
        merely &quot;determined&quot; by the genetic code, for
        instance - and those able to (consciously) recognize the
        sign-function? Where does that difference come from and
        what are its implications?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">These questions have in a certain way
        already been formulated, but too abstractly again, by
        second order cyberneticians, by Maturana, Varela, Pask
        and Von Foerster in particular. And we encounter them in
        constructivist circles, with well-known sociological and
        ethical conclusions. But time and again, they leave us
        unsatisfied, basically because they do not provide us
        with sufficient empirical or practical evidence, leaving
        that type of project languishing in major part on wishful
        thinking. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Where, then, lie the originality and
        the specific coherence of Hoffmeyer's approach, as
        anchored in the <i>biosemiotic</i> program? Generally,
        biosemioticians attempt to link the fact that we are
        open, living beings with our &quot;meaningful&quot; ways
        of behaving and acting. If we are able to entertain
        meaningful interactions with an environment, it is <i>because</i>
        we are <i>living systems</i>. In other words: if we are
        able to interpret our surroundings, it is because of our
        capacity to arrive at a requisite <i>closure</i> - that
        protects us from being invaded by irrelevant stimuli all
        the time-, as well as because of our essential openness
        for new potentially meaningful stimuli that arise from
        our contacts with the world. There is something robust,
        as well as something creative in the universe. <i>Living</i>
        and <i>systems</i>, these two words cannot be stressed
        enough in any biosemiotic program. To analyze their
        intricate and tricky linkages, to describe the multiple
        manifestations of openness and closure, to analyze their
        ingredients at various levels, to account for their
        evolution in terms of general principles and mechanisms,
        and, last but not least, to always take into account the
        implications of ourselves being living systems in
        describing the living, ... all these are important
        subparts of the biosemiotic program. Not an easy task to
        fulfill, but a most fascinating one...</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">What then gives coherence and
        originality to Hoffmeyer's contribution in this debate? I
        would call it the post-modern core in it, even if, as I
        can guess, the author would not agree with the use of
        that term here. By post-modern, I mean that in analyzing
        the ingredients of the living, in looking at its diverse
        modalities of being, and in taking into account our
        multiple ways of describing it, there is, always,
        something that escapes control - the very openness
        referred to above. There is a gap in any description;
        something escapes in any codification; nothing can be
        totally or absolutely grasped. The author argues for this
        idea in two basic ways, of which the first is to me much
        more convincing than the second.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Firstly, Hoffmeyer states that the
        nature of a code itself implies the impossibility to
        &quot;code for everything&quot;. A particular
        code-duality creates a space within which evolution and
        history can take place. Precisely because it is based on
        exclusion, the code can create semiotic freedom. Robert
        Rosen (and even Jacques Lacan, quoted in this book)
        arrived at very similar conclusions in characterizing the
        modelling relation. Rosen for instance writes:
        &quot;(...) a modelling relation (...) is to be
        established through an <i>encoding</i> of qualities or
        observables of S into formal or mathematical objects in M
        (...) any encoding of a natural system S into a formal
        system M involved an act of abstraction, in which
        non-encoded qualities are necessarily ignored. Such an
        abstraction is not peculiar to theory; indeed, any act of
        observation (on which any kind of encoding must be based)
        is already an abstraction in this sense.&quot; (R. Rosen,
        <i>Anticipatory Systems</i>, pp. 339-340, original
        italics).</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">However, there is a second gap that
        comes to redouble the previous one, and that arises once
        we introduce the idea of system or of closure. The gap
        here refers to the impossibility of adequately describing
        the internal dynamics of living systems, and the
        necessity, faute de mieux, to adopt an external, however
        partially totalizing, viewpoint to account for it. It is
        a gap that, in the field of evolutionary biology, leads
        to the difference between internalist and externalist
        viewpoints (or the endo-exo discussions, cf. Matsuno,
        Kampis, Atmanspacher). For human beings, this issue
        becomes: how to know fellow human beings, or even fellow
        living beings, when considering the fact that they are <i>systems</i>,
        so that it is impossible to break them apart without
        destroying them as systems? An additional question is:
        How can we arrive at a knowledge or an understanding even
        of ourselves? For Hoffmeyer, empathy, identification and
        ethics seem to be the main answers here. After citing
        Arne Naess: &quot;An identification process can be
        defined as a process whereby another being's interests
        are instinctively responded to as though they were one's
        own interests&quot;, he writes &quot;One might even say
        that we banish the loneliness engendered by this
        awareness of our mortality by <i>instinctively</i> taking
        responsibility for one another&quot; (p. 133, italics
        added). And ethics quite logically finds a place as
        follows: &quot;Ethics is not about values that we opt
        for, or that are imposed on us from outside (...) it is
        about self-knowledge, i.e., the recognition of our
        ability to empathize as the very life-line that can help
        us overcome alienation and fear of death&quot; (p. 133).</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">It certainly is a challenge to
        introduce these gaps in a field that has its roots in
        biology and biochemistry, where they have not played a
        role. The present book is on this point quite amazing.
        However, a challenge that remains intact, even after this
        book, is the one that consists in addressing the relation
        between the different kinds of gap. The author does
        stress some of the difficulties in this regard, but
        clearly many questions are left unanswered, and are, in
        my opinion, too hastily solved on the basis of ethics and
        empathy. For instance, it is important, for any
        biosemiotician, to grasp the emergence of closure in
        various contexts, and the way in which a codification,
        i.e. the material form of inscription, as well as the
        interactive context, are important in this process of
        emergence. This problem is crucial for biological systems
        in general, but it is likely that it takes on a different
        form when dealing with psychic closure. Isn't this a very
        important issue when dealing with the implications of
        our, typically human, ways of describing the living? Why
        would the biological closure, typical for the living in
        general, be in any sense comparable to the psychical
        closure? Shouldn't we seek to differentiate the
        principles and mechanisms at work in different contexts?
        Clearly, our means to acquire semiotic freedom throughout
        our own particular histories are radically different from
        those of other animals. Clearly, the relational context
        in which humans (and some other animals too) are born,
        due to their initial helplessness, as Freud calls it,
        creates a different setting from the one of other
        animals. Precisely on this point, instead of hastily
        filling the gap with empathy and ethics, instead of
        calling for instincts - which is, in my opinion, the most
        anti-biosemiotic move that could possibly be made -
        detailed empirical and clinical investigations need to be
        undertaken. Perhaps then we would see that humans are
        materially, and not only meaningfully determined by
        language; we would have to acknowledge that empathy is
        based on different forms of identification, that
        precisely the mechanism of identification didn't work in
        all situations, and that our way of manipulating
        language, i.e. of entering meaningful interactions, is
        intimately linked to that capacity of identification.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I am sympathetic to Hoffmeyer's view of
        the world, certainly when it comes to the fragmented and
        quasi-faithful ways of making sense of our surroundings.
        I am also in favor of his view on memorizing and
        forgetting, partial and fragmented again. I do agree that
        ethics follows quite naturally from that
        &quot;quasi-faithfulness&quot;. But where the author
        comes to the (minimal) ways of overcoming
        &quot;alienation and fear of death&quot;, he seems to
        &quot;forget&quot; his own starting-point, or should I
        say: he is guided by the projection of his own wishes?
        The sources of life and death run parallel, ... as well
        as the sources of truth and deceit. On this point, the
        biosemiotic project might gain by taking into account the
        various forms of human self-knowledge - psychotic,
        neurotic, autistic, perverse, ... - that we know of.
        Multiple human ways of material inscription or
        codification are available, as well multiple human ways
        of taking habits. All of them show the intricate
        relations between life and death, ... and between truth
        and lies. The least we can do, is to take these
        inscriptions &quot;at face value&quot;, as unbridgeable
        &quot;lumps in nothingness&quot;.</font><!--mstheme--></font></p>
