<I>Event and Body-mind. An Outline of a Post-postmodern Approach to Phenomenology</I></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Abstract</FONT></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>In this article Ole Fogh Kirkeby outlines - what may
be called - a post-postmodern theory of meaning. Where both deconstructivist
and constructivist theories of the social construction of consciousness
would usually place their &quot;Ding an sich&quot; outside their rhetorically
conceived language games, Kirkeby places it inside, in - what he calls
- the fusion of event and body-mind. Thus the concept of meaning is able
to be framed in relation to both our historical existence and our pre-linguistic
conditions of experience through a theory of action as the core concept
of Phenomenology. In the consequence of this Kirkeby abolishes the two
dualism’s of epistemology: the one between consciousness and world, and
the one between mind and body. This is effected through the fusion of event
and body-mind, and made possible with language as the medium wherein this
fusion happens. </FONT></I></P>
