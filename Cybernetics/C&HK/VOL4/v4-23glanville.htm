<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Before We Begin</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>In attempting to introduce
Pask’s notion of conversation, and to show that it is both more fundamental
and more economical (Occam’s Razor) than older notions of communication,
there were a number of loose ends I promised I would return to and tidy
up, which I attempt here. This is not pure Pask, or even my interpretation
of him: it is my (conversational) response to him, an extension. In particular,
I attempt to deal with what I see as problems in conversations which are
not, somehow, controlled, and with what the conversational paradigm tells
us about ourselves.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>How Do We Know What
We’re Talking About In A Conversation: And How Do We Get Back On The Rails
When We Leave Them (Error Correction)?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>I had a long-term disagreement
with Pask on this subject, ie the question of how participants in a conversation
decide what to talk about (the &quot;Topic&quot; of the conversation, as
Pask called it) and of how they should correct the &quot;errors&quot; of
understanding (ie, the construction of meanings by the listener that were
not recognisable to the speaker as expressed in the listener’s response).
He claimed these were not special problems but could be dealt with in the
conversation, as he depicted it. I disagreed. While it is conceivable that
nothing special need be done, my opinion is that, without some mechanism,
error regulation is in effect random and inconceivably clumsy. Participants
in a conversation would know they were not in agreement but would not know,
other than by hit and miss, how to resolve the situation. There would be
no way to direct the next trial after a previous one had failed, no way
to reduce the error and home in!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>In the first instance,
a conversation needs to have some shared focus (ie, a general topic). It
can wander from this, of course, but it needs to start off establishing
the idea pretty fast that there is, at the very least, to be a conversation
(ie, conversation is the topic). Even if the focus is just to have a conversation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>The difficulty lies
not so much in the initial choice, but in the error correction mechanism.
It does not matter much what initial hunch you make for your topic so long
as you can effectively reduce the distance between you and your conversational
partner. (The old panel game &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; is a demonstration
of how powerful even binary partition can be in helping narrow down differences.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>I propose that error
regulation and correction in a conversation is best thought of as occurring
through a meta-level. This is where I differ from Pask, who did not believe
that such a special mechanism was necessary.</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>(Nor is it,
if we have an infinite quantity of time.) If the conversation is taken
to operate on one level, then the error regulation must happen on another,
meta-level—where it is also possible to hold a conversation. The inclusion
of the meta-level allows that not only is an error recognised, but the
error can become a topic of the conversation, and therefore be discussed.
(A conversation, thus, being held on the level of the meta-level: a conversation
about a conversation.) Without the structure of this discussion (used as
a means of characterising the error), error regulation is merely by trial
and error. And, in spite of Twenty Questions, this can be very time consuming
and tiresome, destroying the flow of the conversation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Note that, in this
version of error regulation (correction), the conversation has shifted
topics. There is what is being talked about, and above it there is a critical
examination. And when there is an error, this allows that error in turn
to become the (temporary) topic of the conversation, permitting the nature
of (and hence the cure for) the error to be discussed and acted upon. I
claim this is not practicable without the meta-level, and that the topic
can switch, so that the &quot;commentary&quot; of the meta-level can become
the topic of the conversation (with a further critical (meta-)meta-level
above it). Thus, what was the meta-level now becomes the level of the conversation,
with another meta-level above it. But, meanwhile, below, at what was the
original level, this is a substratum where the original conversation is
kept (the context within which the error is discussed). And for each conversation
there is a substratum, that is, a context against which the conversation
takes place: the general topic of the conversation. Three words indicating
the similar ideas but, themselves, with different &quot;intentional contexts&quot;.
(See, for instance, my 1996 paper &quot;Communication without Coding&quot;
in Modern Language Notes Vol III no 3.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, to permit effective
error regulation in a conversation, I believe three levels are needed.
The level of the conversation, the meta-level, in which monitoring and
error regulation take place, and the substratum, which provides the context.
At any moment, the conversation may be raised so that what was the meta-level
becomes the level of the conversation with, respectively, a new meta-level
and substratum above and below, or be lowered so that the substratum becomes
the conversation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Reaching an Agreement</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>The purpose of conversation
(insofar as it is necessary to talk of it as having a purpose), and of
the error regulation structure proposed above as an extension to Pask’s
formulation, is to permit participation and the building of meanings such
that participants can retain their individual meanings yet still communicate.
The error regulation structure proposed above facilitates what would be,
in Pask’s original formulation, very clumsy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>The reason for having
error regulation is that it allows agreement to be reached. Conversations
continue until an agreement is reached (they may continue afterwards),
or they are abandoned. Abandonment is an extreme form of disagreement:
and agreement includes the agreement to disagree. Thus, conversations,
while they may freewheel for long periods and from topic to topic are inevitably
tied up in time: they start, and they end. (Pask’s later work, as I have
mentioned, centred on the form of the conversation when it did not begin
or end but was eternal: the structure of our constructed world. He called
it the Interaction of Actors Theory.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Novelty</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Novelty is inherent
in the conversation. Indeed, it is virtually impossible to avoid. Since
no participant is the same as any other, his/her understanding (the meaning
he/she constructs) will be different (that is, uniquely personal). Therefore,
no one understanding is the same as any other. Thus, in-so-far as it is
possible to present one’s understanding so that other conversational participants
can construct their own meanings, what one presents will, in principle,
always be different to what any other will present: hence, novelty (that
which is not in my current understanding) is endemic. (Note that this concept
of novelty is local: it is not necessary that what seems novel to me is
universally novel, in the way we sometimes require. Novelty, as I use it
here, refers to personal novelty.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Such novelty may be
glossed over. But it may also be pounced upon and exploited, even exaggerated,
to create novelty of a dramatic and more-than-personal kind.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Words with Meanings:
Language as Short Cut</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>I have insisted that
words have no meanings: meanings lie in the &quot;we-who-have-and-talk-about-meanings&quot;,
not in the media of communication. Nor does it matter what I mean to say,
(my own meaning): the meaning that each participant in an act of communication
makes is his/her own. But above, for instance in discussing novelty, I
was using words as if they do have meanings and as if I can specify which
meaning (where there are several), and/or propose modifications of such
meanings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>At one level, I believe
this is irrefutable in terms of both logic and experience (which are not
necessarily coincident). We know our experiences are different, and we
know how hard it can be to understand even close friends in a familiar
conversation. At another, we have dictionaries: and we believe in them
(as I write, I have used a dictionary twice already today to help me check
words in some texts I am editing).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>My explanation for
this is rather straightforward. In spirit, it is close to Luhmann.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>There is clearly a
way in which we treat words (and any other devices we use as media of communication,
and the units thereof) as if they do have meanings although they do not.
How can this contradiction be resolved?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>It seems to me that,
in negociating an agreement with a conversational partner, even with the
error regulation structure I have proposed, we are involved in a very long-winded
business. And it’s very time and effort consuming when we have to go through
the same business with every partner and on every occasion. Humans might
be characterised as repetition generators and as simplifiers: that is,
we find patterns which simplify the random continuum, and we note these
patterns again and again. That is a major part of how we learn (from experience).
These processes allow us to construct the world as regular, and we do it
with flair, frequency and success!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>It seems that this
is a reasonable account of (some of) what we do. Then why not do it in
conversation? If I wish to present again what I have presented before,
perhaps to the same conversational partner, why not present it the same
way? Thus, repetition of presentation in the conversation can become fixed:
and that fixity can be tried with other partners. Indeed, the trying can
be most insistent. And when other partners agree to a similar presentation,
it does indeed appear as if the means of presentation has a particular
meaning: which we take to be no longer as if, but actually the case. Observing
more regularities (on the meta-level, as well) allows us to guess new presentations
that may work right off. And so on.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>When we do this, we
agree a sort of social fixity in presentation in the conversation, which
makes meaning appear to be in what we have fixed—in the words, for instance.
What we end up with is language as a shortcut, a collection of social conventions
which become treated as if they were meanings resident in words etc. Meaning,
in this sense, is a social construction. And, in this sense only, we can
talk of meaning in language, and develop social studies such as history
and etymology. Of course, within these conventions we still negociate,
but we do not have to negociate everything on every occasion with every
conversational partner, from scratch. Thus, we have a social system: to
join it we have to accept all that system’s many rules: a down-side, for
it involves a loss of choice and a prediction of labels and meanings.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>But there is more to
the down-side of this fixity. Firstly, it restricts us in how we may make
presentions: it does me little good to present an ovoid form emanating
from a chicken as a &quot;bolt&quot;, when everyone else calls it an &quot;egg&quot;.
This works at a much deeper level, however, for each of us has to sign
on to join the already existing (ie, prior) system. So, as children, we
have to learn not just how we want to construct the world, but also how
this prior social system will permit us to: for conversing is a (the?)
major part of our experience. We have to pay our dues to join in what is
a very determining system. We can’t see this in our mother tongue (how
appropriate that expression is). But we know it full well when, as adults,
we try to join in another system (that is, another language).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>(In the extreme, we
actually try to program words so that they have unique and &quot;unambiguous&quot;
meanings. We do this for situations that move very fast, where team efforts
are required and where decisions are not made locally but centrally. We
insist there must be no ambiguity. The clearest example is the military.
A recruit’s initial training is involved in breaking his concept of himself
as independent. It is mind-destroying, and would seem to be so on purpose.
The aim is to produce a fighting machine in which each soldier becomes
a cog. Each soldier is trained to reduce his individuality and distinction.
Communication is no longer by conversation, in which he is a participant
and in which the integrity of his meanings is respected and valued. One
&quot;benefit&quot; is that he will then do exactly what he is told to,
and that orders will be followed unambiguously. Each order—each word—will
unambiguously command a particular response from the soldier. In destroying
the &quot;ambiguity&quot; of words, in giving them exact &quot;meanings&quot;,
we destroy the quality that makes us human, intelligent and interesting:
our distinction and our meaning. It could be said that the turning of communication
from a conversation into a code destroys humanity. It is certainly a feature
of fascist regimes that language becomes both horribly distorted, and also
highly codified, coded and encoded. Of course, this doesn’t actually really
remove our need and our responsibility for making our own meanings, but
it surely seems to.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Secondly, it lets us
delude ourselves as to where meaning lies—that meaning lies in the &quot;words&quot;
and not with us. This is the source of our treating language like a code,
and it reinforces our belief in linearity, cause and effect and coding.
It is an outstanding example of how we use the shortcut of language without
remembering its origin and where its value lies. Thus, we forget that we
are speaking as if, and we even come to believe that word f is bound by
encodment to meaning x.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Meaninglessness.
And Art.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>In contrast, those
means of presentation that have lasted a long time and have had continuing
value over centuries and for millions of people in myriad cultures, must
be taken to be at least highly ambiguous, or, as I choose to put it, meaningless.
A great work of art can have no meaning. It must be an explicitly empty
vessel into which we can invest whatever meanings we individually construct.
This represents a timely return to the prime notion in a conversation,
before society and language got into the act and created the delusory shortcut:
that the means of presentation has no meaning. Listen to the interpretations
of great works of art, and you will find vast variety much of which, in
a logical world, would be mutually exclusive. Great art returns to us our
responsibility to create meaning for ourselves. This is why John Cage was
correct when he said that, as a composer, it was not up to him to impose
his will or interpretation on his music, for he had no more right or rightness
than anyone else. It is this which makes, for instance, authorised recordings
of music, so inherently sterile.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>What we say has no
meaning (other than to us). We do not communicate what we mean. Our partners
in a conversation make their own meanings. We can only try to make and
re-present to our conversational partners our meaning made from what we
imagine they mean. We can never share meanings, nor can we transmit them.
We are alone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>And yet, there is a
strange experience that we may have, when we loose ourselves in the presence
of art (and other phenomena, for instance crowds, sex, ritual). When we
do not distinguish the &quot;I&quot; any more, and when, therefore, the
question of meaning etc disappears. Then we seem to share, we are united
somehow in a whole, perhaps because we are all where there is no &quot;I&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>What Does the Conversation
Tell us about Ourselves?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>There is a final argument
I wish to present in favour of the conversation. In order for us to take
part in a conversation we have to show some of the characteristics we believe
to be most profoundly and attractively human.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>For instance, I cannot
take part in a conversation with you, with any hope of negociating an agreement,
unless I show open-mindedness and generosity: open-mindedness because I
must be prepared to listen to what you say, and generosity because I must
accept that you put things differently and that I cannot insist on having
things all my own way. (If I do insist on this, I end up with no conversation.
We have all taken part in these sorts of &quot;conversations&quot;: often
when we give but our conversational partner only takes, but also sometimes
as the one taking and not giving.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Furthermore, we have
to take responsibility for our own meanings, and hence our own actions.
This is not only because there are no meanings but the meanings we (each
of us) make. It is also because when the form is circular and I am in that
circle, there is no stop point but the one I choose: and the only one I
can choose is where I am.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>From this comes the
ability to recognise error and magnanimously accept that we are wrong.
This is one of the essentials for us to be able to learn. Error is a very
positive phenomenon: the ability of cybernetics to accept error for what
it is, and not try to get rid of or minimise it (ie, not to demonise it)
is one of its great contributions. As also is the need to consider others
as reciprocal and find reciprocity in them: to see others in our image.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>I contend (see above)
that the use of the encoded message approach to communication and to what
we do and can communicate reduces these qualities to insignificance, offering
us, instead, correctness, conformity and narrow-mindedness; blame instead
of responsibility; meanness and carping criticism instead of generosity
of spirit; monologue instead of dialogue, conversation, and novel inspiration
and joy. And it allows us to denigrate others rather than to treat them
as our equals (and, hence, eventually, to be denegrated by them in turn).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>I am reminded of this
every time I think of old relatives—trapped in the world of senile dementia.
There is no communication here, for conversation is no longer possible.
There is no interaction: there are just, possibly, private codes. There
is no give and take. There is just an outpouring: from me, just as much
as from them, for I do not know how to transcend this breakdown. Private
codes uttered without connection. A Beckettian voice from a fixed mouth
ploughing through the darkness. Endlessly screaming, &quot;Not I&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>I have learnt where
my humanity lies. Thank you, Gordon.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+0>Notes</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. Until recently, I was a staff member at the University
of Portsmouth in the UK. However, I have accepted early retirement, and
am starting the challenge of spending the projected last third of my life
trying to learn to do what is good for me, rather than what is demanded
of me. I feel I leave education at a good time: before it is entirely destroyed.
This does not, however, mean I am leaving the world of cybernetics, or
am no longer interested in academic and teaching work: I am open to offers!

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. Gordon Pask was a generous teacher. He did not require
agreement and he did not stand on his dignity. Rather, he looked to his
students to develop themselves through the discipline of cybernetics. He
looked to the imitation of his best standards. Some have been angry that
I would disagree with my professor. My professor was not among them. Pask
revelled in such disagreement and he and I would, on occasion, develop
and orchestrate disagreements in order to open/stir things up a bit. He
was interested in education, not training, as befits the visionary of the
uses of computers in learning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3. The notion of negociation in a conversation is probably
due to Laurie Thomas. Conversation Theory was developed, in good part,
through seminars held at Brunel University (as well as in Pask’s research
company, System Research). As well as Pask’s own seminars, he shared a
seminar series with Thomas, in which many of the ideas here propounded
were teased out and fought over. It is not always clear who contributed
what. (The contributions of individual students are even less clear.) See,
for instance, Thomas, L and Harri-Augstein, S (1993) &quot;Learning Conversations&quot;,
London, Routledge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>4. This is what breaks my heart about my favourite writer,
Samuel Beckett, who set up a censorious orthodoxy to mind, mindlessly,
his works.</FONT></P>
