<I>Praxis: Beyond Theory and Practice</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Some years ago a prominent Silicon Valley firm tried to
rapidly design and introduce a new computer in response to a competitive
challenge. Although the project was initially skillfully laid out, it fell
apart and subsequently failed. Meetings among major contributors often
moved smoothly to agreement, but subsequent actions led to bizarre mismatches
and unmet expectations. Subsequently we had the occasion to examine the
fragmentary pieces of this effort in considerable depth, interviewing many
of those involved and systematically sampling texts from each of the involved
departments (Osborn 1990).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are two findings that stood out:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>First, each of the functional groups involved in the project
believed they did what they were supposed to do and it was the other people
who failed. Second, we found definitive evidence that the groups worked
from practices and theories that were systematically incompatible.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Those in charge of the design specification and budget
worked from a classic (classifying) mentality; the engineers were pragmatic
and ingenious about what could be built; and the marketing department and
over-all project management responded to customer values and competitive
demands. A detailed content analysis showed the three groups used different
logics, different constructions of meaning, and different criteria for
performance. Moreover, they had no sense that each group spoke a different
language or that they acted from a different paradigm; they were simply
frustrated. They took for granted that their theories were correct and
their skills were highly developed. They did not see that their practices
did not, nor could not fit together. These managers and technicians knew
their own practice, but they lacked the skills to integrate across paradigms
with differing logics, causalities, and criteria of achievement. This case
took place in an organization of highly educated workers and managers.
The same story can be told of communities, government agencies, academic
institutions - wherever people work together.</FONT></P>
