<I>A Principal Exposition of Jean-Louis Le Moigne's Systemic Theory</I></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Abstract</FONT></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The aim of this article is to present to the reader
the theoretical construction of Jean-Louis Le Moigne. It starts with a
discussion of the background that is relevant for this construction, which
is: a few words about Le Moigne himself, some influences on his thinking
and an overview of the theoretical framework together with some domains
of application. The following exposition of Le Moigne’s Systemics (LMS)
is articulated in three groups: the what, the why and the how of knowing.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The <B>what</B> presents the two basic hypotheses of
LMS’ epistemological version, called Projective Constructivist Epistemology.
These are: the phenomenological and the teleological hypotheses. The three
dominating properties of the first hypothesis, that is the irreversibility,
the recursivity and the dialectics of knowing, are presented as well.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The <B>why</B> question presents the criterion for
validation, which is projective (or cognitive) feasibility, to be contrasted
with the positivist’s aspiration for objective truth. This presents LMS’
solution to the dilemma between objectivity and relativism. Projective
feasibility is possible due to the so-called social contract and the autonomy
of science as a domain of thought, both are discussed.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The third question, the <B>how</B>, presents a set
of cognitive instruments for knowledge constitution. These may be articulated
in three sub-categories: modelling rationality, systemic modelling and
inforgetic theory.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>Under the label of modelling rationality the following
topics are discussed: formalism, procedural rationality, conjunctive or
self-referential system of logic and the discussion of the method for conduct
of good reason.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>Secondly, systemic modelling discusses: complexity,
modelling, the canonic model of a General System, LMS’ modelling instrument
called Systemography, the canonic model of a General Process, the canonic
model of Information Processing System, LMS’ instrument for articulation
of complex systems called Teleological Complexification of Functional Levels,
a general and a priori identification of pertinent levels of complexification
of a complex system’s organisation as manifested in the canonic model called
Decision-Information-Organisation System, and finally the paradigm of an
active organisation: Eco-Auto-Re-Organisation with its canonic model of
organisation, the latter is a conflictful conjunction of three recursive
functions: to produce and self-produce, to relate and self-relate, to maintain
and self-maintain.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>Thirdly, inforgetic theory refers to the conceptual
relation between information and organisation. It includes: the canonic
model of information: Signified-Sign-Signification, the first principle
of inforgetics: the principle of self-organisation, and the second principle
of inforgetics: the principle of intelligent action. Finally, the article
gives a brief summing up of the significance of Le Moigne’s contribution.</FONT></I></P>
