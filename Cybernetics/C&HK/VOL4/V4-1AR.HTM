<H3>Axel Randrup:<BR>
<I>Evolution and Cognition. Official journal of the Konrad Lorenz Institute
for Evolution and Cognition Research, Austria</I></H3>

<P>The new journal, Evolution and Cognition has some fundamental traits
in common with Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing. In particular, both journals
complement studies of the observed with studies of the observer. In Cybernetics
&amp; Human Knowing this study is based on second order cybernetics, while
in the new journal it is based on the evolutionary study of cognition,
also called Evolutionary Epistemology (EE).</P>

<P>EE was from the beginning based on general evolutionary biology, which
like all biology assumes the existence of an external world, independent
of the human observer (materialist realism). The studies of EE led, however,
to the result that our cognitive apparatus is a product of biological evolution,
and that our cognition’s (including the assumption of an external world)
must depend on our cognitive apparatus. This of course led to difficulties
with the basic assumption of a world independent of the human observer;
materialist realism was then modified into &quot;hypothetical realism&quot;.</P>

<P>In the beginning hypothetical realism was understood as saying that
our scientific theories and &quot;laws&quot; of the external world should
be regarded as hypotheses, while the idea that realism itself could be
regarded as an hypothesis was not earnestly considered, Wuketits (1984,
see i.a. p. 212). Now in 1995 - 96, however, several authors in Evolution
&amp; Cognition consider realism as an hypothesis and even suggest alternative
hypotheses. Eva Krall for instance regards &quot;objects as invariance’s
in observations and not as something that may or may not <I>exist in reality
&quot; </I>(Vol. l, No. l, see note 9, p. 84 ). This development in EE
is welcomed by the present reviewer, since I have for many years thought
along similar lines, Randrup et al. (1982), Marchais &amp; Randrup (1991,
see pp. 2-5). I also think that observations can be regarded as mental
or conscious experiences, a view which combined with Eva Krall's view will
approximate philosophical idealism; but the authors in Evolution &amp;
Cognition seem to stop short of this possibility, perhaps it will be discussed
in later issues of the journal.</P>

<P>It is often argued that if one resigns from materialist realism, he
must also resign from other human beings as parts of reality, which would
lead to epistemological solipsism (Diettrich, Vol. l, No. 2, p. 111). Here
Artigiani's article on mind conceived as &quot;the experience of brains
in social networks&quot; is relevant and interesting. In my interpretation
Artigiani comes close to the notions &quot;collective mind&quot; and &quot;collective
brain&quot;, which have been conceived as alternatives to solipsism (Vol.
2, No. 1).</P>

<P>Self-organizing processes, self-reference and semiotics are important
subjects in Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing associated with the study of
the human observer, and also these subjects are discussed in Evolution
&amp; Cognition, based on evolutionary views. Thus Oeser writes about EE
as a self-referential epistemology of natural science (Vol. 2, No. 1) and
Krall discusses structural coupling between organism and environment and
in this context regards changes in the organism's internal parameters as
&quot;adaptive self-modification&quot; (Vol. 1, No.1, p. 79 f). Language
is discussed extensively by Sj&ouml;lander (Vol.1, No.1) and by Witzany
(Vol.1, No. 2); both stress the <I>use</I> of language as important for
its meaning and formation. Wimmer associates meaning with concrete action,
and later in the development of a child and in the evolutionary history
of Homo sapiens with emotions separated from the area of concrete actions
and perceptions. Wimmer also writes about the production of meaning and
here refers to two expressive Cerman terms: Bedeutungsverleihung, Bedeutungsgebung
(Vol. l, No.1, pp. 41 and 47-48).</P>

<P>Besides these issues of fundamental scientific and philosophical significance,
Evolution &amp; Cognition also treats subjects of more specific and practical
nature.</P>

<P>For me Riedl's paper on deficiencies of adaptation in human reason is
particularly interesting, because Riedl combines his theoretical views
with topical world problems such as class differences, overpopulation,
overkill capacity and environment degradation (Vol. l, No. 1).</P>

<P>Wimmer writes about the evolutionary roots of emotions. He finds that
emotions are founded &quot;as deeply as cognition in basic biological-regulative
processes&quot; and distinguishes between two main types of human emotionality:
emotions at the sensorimotor level and emotions at the level of symbolic
information-processing mechanisms. Wimmer's investigations lead to &quot;an
extension of the concept &quot;emotion&quot; and, of necessity, cognition
such that their basic form of acquiring knowledge (Kenntnisgewinn) is a
unified affective-cognitive process&quot; ( Vol. l, No. 1). These views
are further elaborated in an article with Ciompi, (Vol. 2, No. 1) where
it is stated that the organizing and integrating function of affects on
cognition is an essential element within the affective cognitive interactions.</P>

<P>Gisela Miller-Kipp discusses what pedagogues may expect from EE. As
a pedagogue she is of course particularly interested in ontogenetic development,
but she believes that EE can contribute useful aspects from the hypothesis
of biological evolution. Thus EE urges pedagogues to consider the relationship
between the cognitively active human individual (the &quot;subject&quot;
in their terms) and the environment as a process of structural adaptation.
She also thinks that the learning process called &quot;life &quot; is an
evolutive continuum encompassing both biological and cultural history.
Therefore &quot;In the light of evolution learning is to be comprehended
as a constructive interaction with environment in accordance to a hereditary
pattern&quot; (Vol. 2, No. 1).</P>

<P>Evolution &amp; Cognition is open both to papers reporting empirical
research work and to theoretical papers. In the first issues theory predominates
strongly, but a few experiments are reported. Thus Huber reports experiments
showing, clear evidence of single alternation behavior in goldfish (Vol.
l, No. 1) and Lalouschek et al. report experiments on the ability of humans
to distinguish between regularly and randomly occurring events (Vol. l,
No. 2). Perhaps the journal itself will inspire more empirical research
in the field of EE.</P>

<P>Clearly, efforts have been made to write correct English in the journal.
Still, several authors write long German periods, in English which makes
the reading more difficult. There are also a substantial number of misprints,
some of them disturbing (e.g. &quot;is&quot; in stead of &quot;as&quot;).
Of course these formalities can be improved in future issues.</P>

<P>Generally l find that the quality of Evolution &amp; Cognition is at
a high level, and I think that this journal will be of interest for all
students of cognitive science and of evolutionary biology. For me the reading
of the first three issues has been an illuminating update of my orientation
in EE, and it has given me a very acute impression of the close relations
between EE and second order cybernetics.</P>

<P>Evolution &amp; Cognition appears in two issues per year, each about
85 pages. The annual subscription rate is 50 $, single issue price 30 $.
