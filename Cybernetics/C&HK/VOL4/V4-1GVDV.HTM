<P>Gertrudis Van de Vijver (GVdV): Heinz von Foerster, you are the central
figure in the history of second order cybernetics — creating in 1958 the
Biological Computer Laboratory, that is generally considered as the meeting
place of second order cyberneticians — so I would like to start with some
questions related to this history. One of the things that I always found
striking in second order cybernetics is the risky, adventurous character
of its ideas. Did you perceive these ideas in a similar way when you created
the Biological Computer Laboratory&nbsp;? Did you find it then risky, adventurous
with regard to first order cybernetics and with regard to science in general&nbsp;?</P>

<P>Heinz von Foerster (HvF): Well, I am rarely self-reflecting, living
very much at the moment what is going on outside of me. So I am not really
reflecting upon what I do now, what happens now, etc. I am much more active,
involved all the time. Anyway, the second order notion is not only appreciable
to the cybernetic idea but it is a very wide, I would say even semantic
or epistemological perspective that pops up in various disciplines. There
are many more second order notions besides those in cybernetics: any concept
that is applicable to itself is a second order notion. That is why 'second
order' poses a problem of understanding. It is also popping up at this
conference now. What the organizers propose, is to cut through the fractionisation
and the collapse of the various fields of knowledge into subfields and
sub-subfields. They propose going from a <I>disciplinary</I> perspective,
where you understand your own field, to an <I>interdisciplinary</I> perspective,
where you not only have to understand your own field but also your colleague's
field, then to <I>transdisciplinary</I> thinking. In the latter case, not
understanding X-Y-Z is at stake; X-Y-Z become now understanding. So what
you have in transdisciplinary research is understanding of understanding.</P>
