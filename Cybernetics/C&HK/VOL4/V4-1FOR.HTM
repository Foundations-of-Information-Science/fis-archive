<H3>FOREWORD</H3>

<P>S&oslash;ren Brier</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>13. November 1996 Heinz von Foerster - the father of second-order
cybernetics - turned 85 years of age, and was celebrated at the University
of Vienna with lectures, seminars and social events. Earlier, the journal
Systems Research (Wiley, Volume 13, Number 3) published as a special issue
a festschrift for von Foerster. Edited by Ranulph Glanville, it contains
over two hundred pages with papers on von Foerster's many contributions
to the foundation and development of second order cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>As a journal of second order cybernetics developing the
thoughts of, among others, von Foerster, Maturana, Varela, Spencer-Brown,
Pask, Luhmann, etc., we are in many senses, one continuing festschrift.
Nevertheless, we have on this occasion found it fitting to present an interview
with Heinz von Foerster about the origins and perspectives of his second
order ideas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The major content of this issue is devoted to a paper
by Eric Schwarz spelling out his &quot;Neuchatel model&quot; of autopoietic
and chaotic change. This general evolutionary model attempts to combine
many concepts from system science, second order cybernetics, thermodynamics
and chaos theory in a constructive transdisciplinary way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the Praxis section, Fred Steier and Eric Eisenberg
share their experiences of introducing second order cybernetic principles
in the design and organization of an &quot;information&quot; system and
its social setting at NASA. After the Challenger accident, NASA officials
sought to develop a &quot;Lessons Learned Information System&quot; to facilitate
sharing knowledge of best practices and mishaps. Reflections on this invite
lessons about information, knowledge, social learning, context and communication
for all document mediating systems to be learned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Ranulph Glanville continues his column on cybernetic concepts.
This time it is Pask’s idea about communication and conversation which
is spelled out in a short and provocative essay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Louis H. Kauffman is welcomed as a new column writer.
His topic is <I>virtual logic</I>!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Axel Randrup reviews the new journal &quot;Cognition and
Evolution&quot; which from its focus on evolutionary epistemology also
takes issue with constructivism and second order cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Welcomed as new consultant editors are Gertrudis Van de
Vijver and Daniel M. Dubois.</FONT></P>
