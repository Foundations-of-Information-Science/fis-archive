        <p><font size="3">A few weeks ago I lent my copy of Steve
        Joshua Heim&#146;s invaluable book &quot;The Cybernetics
        Group&quot; (Cambridge, MIT Press, 1991) to an old, and
        by now dear friend. After reading it, he said &quot;Thank
        God for second order cybernetics&quot;. This response is
        in stark contrast to his response of years ago. When I
        had just been examined for my PhD by Heinz von Foerster
        and Gordon Pask (on a thesis that was, as might be
        inferred from the examiners, very definitely second order
        cybernetics), he accused me, and all other
        cyberneticians, of being fascists who wanted to reduce
        the world to mechanism and destroy both quality and the
        human. I am glad to say he later changed his mind.The
        reason I expose my friend thus is that, in his
        assessment, there is something of the difficulty
        encountered by many in trying to understand cybernetics:
        and some of this difficulty is, I believe, related to how
        we see the role of the animal and the machine in
        Wiener&#146;s descriptive phrase.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I have always understood the outlook of
        cybernetics to be essentially humanist. That is, I have
        always seen it as supporting notions such as quality, and
        the value of that which is outside conventional
        scientific description. That is one of the reasons I have
        been interested in cybernetics: it enables me to handle
        areas that were previously unhandleable, without a danger
        of severely distorting them. But I have, equally, always
        seen it as bringing mechanism into play in a profoundly
        powerful way. My introduction to cybernetics (in a
        consultation with Gordon Pask) showed me the incredible
        power of thinking in a cybernetic manner, of treating the
        world as extreme mechanism. My friend&#146;s responses
        remind me of the possible paradox or contradiction in
        this, in the relationship between cybernetics and the
        duality animal/machine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Perhaps a word of further explanation
        is needed here. For Wiener et al, the notion of animal
        and machine must initially have been one in which the
        animal is treated as mechanism. It is, for instance, made
        up of parts, and these parts may be treated as pulleys
        and pumps, etc. I think they proposed that the whole
        animal was greater that the sum of its parts.
        Nevertheless, the parts were enumerable and mechanical.
        This is, of course, the Cartesian metaphor and formed the
        context in which they were working.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Yet, at the same time, I believe they
        understood that this was not really and adequate
        description. Living at a time when the product of this
        type of thinking had taken horrendous form in atomic
        weaponry, they were also afraid. Heims talks of the
        beginnings of McCarthyism, of the social panic and
        insecurity of the time and the awful, fearful (and
        consequently rather un human) behaviour that often
        resulted. That which is outside the realm of rational
        thought took on a pressing presence in their minds (hence
        Wiener&#146;s second book. &#145;The Human Use of Human
        Beings&#146;), and they were sharply aware of the value
        of their humanity. They lived in the paradox between a
        means of investigation that tended to deny, for instance,
        the reality of fear while, all the time, suffering it
        themselves.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">And they were aware of the strangeness
        of the albeit necessary circular causality they were
        advocating which brings into play self-reference, that
        great bugbear excluded by classical logic, the supposed
        driving engine of and giver of value to the Cartesian way
        of understanding they were heirs to. For selfreference is
        specifically excluded from this view of classical logic.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I would suggest that it is useful, when
        thinking of the animal, to remember that there are
        aspects of the animal, at least as far as the human is
        concerned, that are an important part of our experience,
        which cannot and should not be excluded, and which Wiener
        et al also must have had in the back of their minds when
        they introduced the duality animal/machine. Perhaps it
        would have been better if he had used the word human
        instead of animal. Anyhow, it is in this sense that I
        talk of cybernetics as being essentially humanist. It is
        able to accommodate (some of) those areas of experience
        that are excluded by the mechanistic view of Descartes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Nevertheless, reading Heims&#146; book
        and thinking back to Wiener&#146;s
        &quot;Cybernetics&quot; and some of the cyclostyled and
        undated papers I have of McCulloch, I am surprised at the
        exclusiveness with which the early pioneers believed in
        the overriding power of mechanism. In the case of
        McCulloch, if Heims is correct, the belief was
        overwhelming: he was interested only in mechanism, and
        believed that proper science dealt with mechanism and
        that mechanism could explain everything that it should
        properly explain (to reformulate Turing&#146;s machine).
        Put in terms of Wiener&#146;s determining statement,
        cybernetics is concerned with control and communication
        in the animal and the machine, where the animal is
        treated as (if) a machine, that is, as mechanism. Heims,
        of course, sets this in the appropriate historical and
        social context. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Yet, what I see as the power of the
        cybernetic method of investigation, of the particular way
        that cybernetics allowed and encouraged exploration of
        the world we find our selves in (or, as we would now say,
        we make) is that it transcends mechanism. This is where
        my friend&#146;s old criticism was ill-founded:
        cybernetics applied mechanism not only to the world it
        found/created, but also to that application and to that
        world. Its particular quality is that it pushes to the
        limit and then beyond. The cybernetician, in my image of
        him/her, asks not only the current, but also the next
        question.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Thus, from a very early stage, and
        certainly by the time of the Macy Conferences that
        Heims&#146; book documents, such a basic concept of
        control and communication as feedback (not, of course,
        new in itself) had been both understood and assimilated,
        and its consequences for our interpretation of control
        were also well understood. Causality no longer existed
        uniquely in the linear, conventional sense: for, in a
        system exhibiting feedback, cause must be seen as
        circular. No longer does the chicken &quot;cause&quot;
        the egg (or vice versa: an ambiguity that only points to
        the difficulty of the traditional position re causation),
        but they even &quot;cause&quot; the other through
        continuous, circular causation. Thus, not only were
        concepts - based in mechanism - developed and made
        usable, but they were then pushed to the limit,
        frequently in a sort of self-referential boot-strapping
        where the concepts of this new subject (cybernetics) were
        applied to these cybernetic concepts themselves, in order
        to clarify them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This is how I came to view cybernetics
        when I first met Pask, in 1967. I saw this tremendous
        arsenal of concepts, but also, and much more
        impressively, I saw the power of the way the concepts
        were used to clarify not only what they were applied to,
        but also themselves. I saw the &quot;machine&quot; in
        cybernetics not only throwing light on human activities,
        but also being used to push concepts to the limit: not
        necessarily to confirm these limits, but to see beyond
        the limitations of scope and view that these very
        concepts gave us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Thus, by going to the limit and beyond,
        we see not only what the concepts are, where they end (as
        well as how they help us, in use): we also see the areas
        that are outside their scope, the areas that remain
        unassailed (and, probably, unassailable) by the
        mechanical metaphor. For this reason, almost any
        investigative work in cybernetics is, of necessity,
        implicitly involved with the animal - or, at least, the
        non-mechanical - no matter how much it concentrates on
        the machine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">A look at the work of that time does, I
        think, bear this out. For me, the thought that epitomises
        this period is Ross Ashby&#146;s. A look at his papers
        will show how often they are concerned with limits and
        that which is beyond the scope of analytic scientific
        thinking (so, for instance, he often wrote about
        Bremmermann&#146;s limit to the computable). His &quot;An
        introduction to Cybernetics&quot; (London, Chapman and
        Hall, 1956) remains, for me, the classic text of
        cybernetics: powerful in mechanism, yet freely enjoying
        the limits, especially of the Black Box .</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">It could be only a matter of time
        before such an approach began to look at how the subject
        of cybernetics itself was made: the agency of
        cybernetics. That is to say, for a subject concerned with
        mechanism, and the limits of mechanism, it cannot be too
        long before the mechanism by which the subject is made
        comes under investigation: especially if the general
        approach of the subject is to go to these limits and then
        beyond. This time occurred in cybernetics between, as I
        like to bound it, 1968 and 1975, by the end of which
        period cybernetics had come to terms with its own making
        and transferred its foundation from
        linear-with-applied-circularity to
        circular-with-selected-linearity.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Included in mechanism, it was found,
        was the mechanism of observation that allowed the
        mechanism of the &quot;system&quot; (or whatever you like
        to call it) to be determined, and the mechanism that made
        such describing possible: as well as the mechanisms that
        permitted there to be observation and, indeed, an
        observer to make the observation. The observer
        (traditionally excluded in accounts based in mechanism)
        became an integral part of the system under consideration
        and observation became an inclusive and included process.
        Questions of what is inside and outside were no longer
        clearly answerable: the system no longer had an
        independent existence, which lead to a revision of the
        status of what was knowable.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">To achieve this transfer, simple though
        it now appears, required thinking of the highest calibre,
        and equal bravery (or innocence) to cope with the very
        considerable personal risks being taken by those who did
        it: for they had to rigorously dissemble one mindset, a
        mindset with an enormous amount of cultural weight behind
        it, which had dominated their lives in science, and then
        dare hang in there without any support for an eternal
        instant while the new order began to be formed and to
        take shape. And, as this happened, to apply once again
        the same rigour but without the same supports and the old
        preconceptions and habits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The metaphor changed: from being the
        animal treated as a machine, it became the machine
        treated as an animal. (Perhaps it is worth remembering
        that the source of the word animal lies in the ideas of
        spirit and breath: the anima. In the case at least of
        Pask, the world was literally populated by animae.) That
        is to say, there was a shift from a preoccupation with
        external control and causality, to an appreciation and
        study of autonomy, and the internal control that we come
        to believe is involved in that. The prefix
        &quot;self&quot; became more and more important, and with
        it all those old questions (such as are raised by
        Goedel&#146;s Theorem) were approached with/in new ways
        and, in some cases, became dissolved as problems. This is
        the land of second-order cybernetics, the joint
        share-holder in the concerns of this journal.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Effectively, there was a change in
        focus and interest from causality to autonomy; from chain
        to circle; from action and reaction to interaction; from
        mechanical to animal; from exclusion (observing from
        without) to inclusion (observing from within); from
        realist to constructivist; and from coded messages to
        conversation. And then the earlier metaphor became
        re-incorporated, so both metaphors were held
        simultaneously, co-existing, each throwing its own light,
        which is where we are now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Given that this is the case, that
        cybernetics is the field which explores not only its own
        application, but its limits, its basis and its operations
        (its self) using these same concepts of cybernetics, why
        did the pioneers not jump to this position/conclusion,
        immediately (or at least rapidly), instead of seeming to
        take position as extreme mechanists?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I suggest there are several reasons.
        One is the people they were and the time they lived in,
        when mechanist thinking was producing the goods without
        us seeing and understanding the damage that was
        simultaneously being created through side effects: what
        British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, optimistically,
        later referred to as the &quot;White Heat of
        Technology&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The second, of course, is that it
        requires a special sort of thinking to move a field, or
        at least to move how we appreciate it, from the first to
        the second order. Maybe not all of those who formed
        cybernetics could think like this. Maybe they were tired
        by the initial act of creation. Maybe some tried and may,
        even, have had some partial success. But not enough! (It
        seems that Gregory Bateson, in particular, and to some
        extent Margaret Mead and her entourage, understood the
        need for this shift.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">But the third is, I believe, the most
        telling. When I asked Gordon Pask (who, after all, knew
        all the Macy Conference crew) what Wiener et al would
        have thought about second-order cybernetics, especially
        since it seemed to contradict, undermine or dispose of
        much of what they had achieved, he told me they would
        have been delighted and approved. When I asked him how
        this could be, he said that Wiener, in particular,
        realised there was another step to take, but did not know
        how to do so. He was waiting for others to pick up the
        baton and run with it, to complete the forming of the
        subject he had begun. If you look at his second (and,
        perhaps, better) cybernetics book, &quot;The Human Use of
        Human Beings&quot; (1954) you can see this attitude
        seeping through.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">It seems that it is hard for us to let
        go of our old views. Pioneers and revolutionaries in many
        fields can often only point the way. They indicate, they
        strain in the direction they are pointing, but in the end
        they are too tied to the place that generated the need
        for the pioneering changes to be able to move themselves.
        After they have pointed the way, others must make the
        running.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">And it is amazing how widespread this
        phenomenon is. Recently, I dropped in on a research
        seminar at one of the smaller Universities in Melbourne,
        Australia, to find the early cybernetic texts being
        referenced along with French deconstruction and
        post-modernism in a presentation concerning the nature of
        art, the artist, and especially the art work as we leave
        the second millennium. What should they be? The presenter
        was straining to transcend the limits of both the
        theoretical work he was using to shed understanding and
        his &quot;old&quot; concept of art, the artist and the
        art work, without quite knowing how: he was stuck in
        first order cybernetics, when second order cybernetics
        would have helped him!</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The way in which the phrase &quot;in
        the animal and the machine&quot; is important in
        Wiener&#146;s determination of cybernetics may only now
        be becoming apparent. The inclusion of this pair, without
        an ordering or hierarchy of control, without the metaphor
        being expressed one way or the other (eg, as the animal
        dominating the machine and/or vv), permitted the
        development of cybernetics so that it could start with a
        primacy of the mechanical metaphor, but, by extending
        that into the absurd and then transcending this
        absurdity, allow a science and rigour to be developed
        that gives access to areas previously beyond any but the
        most extremely metaphysically metaphorical of
        investigations, while also humanising how we understand
        and do science. Who could be satisfied that, before the
        concept of autopoiesis, we examined life by killing it;
        that before conversation we insisted on universal coding;
        that before Objects we had no &quot;structures&quot; to
        allow the attachment of unique views; and that before
        distinctions we had no logics that permitted genesis and
        supported the act?</font></p>
