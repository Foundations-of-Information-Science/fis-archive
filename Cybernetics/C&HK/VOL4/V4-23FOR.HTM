<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The present double issue presents two major theoretical
contributions within phenomenological and constructivist epistemology and
method, presenting major new theories and models. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>Event and Body-Mind: An Outline of a Post-postmodern
Approach to Phenomenology </I>is professor Ole Fogh Kirkeby’s paper. He
develops a modern phenomenological-socio-linguistic platform for understanding
of the self-organization of cognition. In a critical dialogue with Niklas
Luhmann’s second order cybernetic communication theory, OFK contributes
a linguistic constructivist position that includes the observer’s basic
emotive extentialism. To solve this problem OFK has developed a new set
of distinctions and concepts that he welds into a phenomenological and
linguistic model of cognition. Although OFK has developed his ideas in
several scholarly books in Danish, this is the first English presentation
of the core elements in this ground breaking theory, which goes beyond
any known constructivist and postmodern position.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Darek M. Eriksson’s article presents <I>A Principal Exposition
of Jean-Louis Le Moigne’s Systemic Theory. </I>This is the first comprehensive
and critical review of this theory complex to appear in English. Le Moigne
has spend a life-time developing his constructivist system-theoretical
approach and applying them to management, business administration and economics.
Most of his work has been published in French. We are pleased to have been
instrumental in the presentation of this important French thinker to the
English speaking cybernetic community. Le Moigne is the leader of the GRASCE
group at university of d’Aix-Marseille, which does research on the adaptation,
systemic organization and complexity of economics. He is also organizing
an association - MCX - dedicated to the Modularization of Complexity, integrating
many kinds of personal and intellectual resources in France, including
several of our editors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Ranulph Glanville and Louis Kauffman continue their personal
and scholarly columns. Glanville on cybernetics concepts - for the moment
communication theory - and Kauffmann on virtual logic - this time on the
possibility of human control of machine proof of mathematical theorems.
Finally we bring book reviews by Jane Jorgensen and Marcello Pakmann.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We welcome Marie La Rochelle from Canada as a new consultant
editor.</FONT></P>
