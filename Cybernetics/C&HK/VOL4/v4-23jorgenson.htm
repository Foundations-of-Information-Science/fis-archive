<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are some books for whom the text is a demonstration
of the subject matter; the form of the writing communicates (or metacommunicates)
the writer's ideas. <I>Beyond Translation: Essays Toward a Modern Philology,</I>
by A.L. Becker, is such a book. This collection of essays and addresses
traces three decades of study of Southeast Asian languages by a professor
emeritus of linguistics and anthropology at the University of Michigan.
In its form, the book can be viewed as a kind of matrix. On one axis we
might arrange certain core principles that have guided Becker in his work
(he might call them the philologist's &quot;tools&quot;): ideas such as
emic and etic analysis, silence across languages, attunement, the linguistics
of particularity, and others. On the second axis might appear the various
texts to which Becker devotes himself. These are drawn from diverse languages
and genres ranging from Burmese proverb to Javanese folktale and shadow
theater to sentences from classical Malay. In reading the book, we see
the core principles successively related to different texts such that each
iteration evokes a deeper understanding of the principles. In the end,
these principles become the &quot;texts&quot; themselves, framed by the
proverbs and folktales. This mutualness of concepts and illustrations eloquently
demonstrates the co-evolution of language and context, of text and observer,
which are the book's central themes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The book is, in a general sense, about the process of
coming to see in a new way through the defamiliarization that accompanies
the learning of a distant language. A premise of this book is that we inhabit
systems of thought and feeling that bear only superficial resemblances
to those of culturally distant groups. Becker shares with Heidegger, Gadamer
and other hermeneutic scholars the belief that our being is formed in our
very way of experiencing and living in language. The research task Becker
has set himself is the discovery of just how different are the lingual
worlds we construct. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Any translation of a distant text raises questions of
equivalence between the translation and the original: equivalence of vocabulary
and idiom, of syntax, and of the social arrangements and everyday experiences
that a particular language presupposes. Becker frames these difficulties
of translation as inevitable conditions arising from the &quot;exuberance&quot;
and &quot;deficiency&quot; of all language, an idea he develops from the
work of Ortega y Gasset. Every utterance is deficient -- it says less than
it wishes to say, and at the same time every utterance is exuberant --
it says more than it intends. The philologist seeks to bridge these inequivalences
through an interpretive process that moves from the translation or &quot;gloss&quot;
of the text toward a more fully contextual appreciation of the source.
In the ongoing effort to remove the exuberances and fill in the deficiencies,
a richer, more subtle sense of the original passage emerges. In many of
the essays Becker examines and reflects on the linguistic data in the kind
of detail that seems, to a nonspecialist, extraordinary. Yet the book invites
and sustains a conversation with a much wider audience than linguists,
by urging us to recognize how &quot;texts&quot; and &quot;contexts&quot;
of many kinds relate in dynamic ensemble. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Like hearing or reading certain poems, the learning of
a distant language can be defamiliarizing; by proposing new distinctions
while relaxing others, a distant language compels us to question the assumptions
of our own language. Becker touches on several such moments of defamiliarization
arising during his fieldwork. One occurred in his early learning of Burmese
as he studied traditional forms of writing. As Becker explains in the essay,
&quot;The Elusive Figures of Burmese Grammar,&quot; Burmese script is written
in a &quot;center- periphery&quot; notation rather than in the linear phonetic
sequence to which we Westerners are accustomed. The distinction is nicely
captured in his description of a Burmese typewriter. Rather than jumping
forward to the next space when a letter is struck, the carriage of a Burmese
typewriter &quot;sits still&quot; so that the single character produced
on the page can be progressively modified by adding marks above, below,
in front of, or behind it. Learning Burmese script, with its strange orientations
to the &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; of words, was initially defamiliarizing,
but proved to be critical to Becker's eventual appreciation of the center-periphery
form as a basic icon in Burmese epistemology. Becker does not seem to say
that defamiliarization is an inevitable outcome of distant language learning,
but rather is an orientation toward the learning itself (one which, he
implies, is available to &quot;learners&quot; of many kinds.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Becker's<I> </I>writing about language affords wonderful
opportunities to be defamiliarized. As Bateson and others have noted, we
are often misled by our everyday metaphors for describing communication
process. In the absence of a relational vocabulary, we often refer to communication
as a kind of &quot;substance&quot; moving in &quot;space&quot; (with its
entailing notions of &quot;barriers&quot; and &quot;breakdowns,&quot;)
thus obscuring its systemic qualities such as might be better captured
in the analogy of communication as a &quot;dance.&quot; Becker, here, selects
a different, almost sculptural idiom for communication, suggesting that
&quot;in using language one <I>shapes</I> old words into new contexts,&quot;
what the Javanese describe as &quot;<I>pushing</I> old language into the
present.&quot; Becker's languaging about languaging (here his choice follows
Maturana and Dewey, again underscoring the processual) is one of the pleasures
of reading this book. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Some texts resist our attempts to push them into the present,
as Becker learned when he tried to translate a story of Gregory Bateson's
for a class of Malay students in advanced linguistics. As he recounts the
incident in &quot;Silence Across Languages,&quot; the story concerns a
computer scientist who asked his computer, &quot;Do you compute that you
will ever think like a human being?&quot; The computer, after analyzing
at length its own computation processes, responded &quot;that reminds me
of a story.&quot; Following Becker's recitation of the story to the audience
of students, there was no laughter, only silence. Later, he was led to
reflect on all of the prior texts, unfamiliar to the Malay students, that
the story presupposes. Ironically, Bateson's central idea, that in storytelling
we connect disparate domains together in order to create new contexts,
was undoubtedly a familiar one to his listeners. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Much of the uniqueness of Becker's work lies in his efforts
to bring together the materials and tools of textual interpretation with
cybernetic notions of <I>self-regulation</I> and <I>constraint</I>, a combination
which will offer many readers with a new way of conceptualizing interpretive
processes. To begin with, any language both enables and constrains the
expression of particular meanings. As Becker notes, &quot;completely spontaneous
linguistic activity is impossible. [since] other people could not understand
it -- or even recognize it as a language&quot; (p. 27). Comprehensibility
of a story or any other text critically depends on many sorts of constraints,
explained here as contextual relations or conventions, which establish
the text's coherence, its novelty, its reference to things outside the
text. The process of moving toward an emic understanding, is, in part,
a process of appreciating the many kinds of constraints that operate locally
on the text. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Equally important, emic understanding implies a change
in the linguistic observer's self-awareness toward a recognition of his
or her own biases. Emic understanding is often misinterpreted as a kind
of &quot;insider's perspective.&quot; According to Becker, it is more fittingly
understood as a &quot;self-conscious understanding, a process that the
outsider undergoes; a deliberate process of foregrounding dissimilarity
and self-consciously methodically correcting the exuberances and deficiencies
of one's outside understanding&quot; (p. 233 ). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The ongoing process of self-correction by an observer,
what Becker calls &quot;attunement,&quot; is essential to the aesthetic
appreciation of distant texts. It also challenges us to explore and extend
our thinking about intercultural communication more generally. Understanding
human encounters across cultural boundaries requires more than simply describing
culturally situated communicative practices and symbols, and the significant
meanings they hold for cultural participants (although this may be an important
first step). Intercultural understanding also challenges us to consider
how people from different cultures go about establishing common ground
-- how co-participants actually manage to get anything done when, for example,
they are working together or simply being together. The modern philology
proposed by Becker offers a viewpoint for reconceptualizing the mutual
processes that allow for intercultural communication to take place, not
as a competition between participants' different frames, but as an opportunity
to ecologically create new ones. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>While the textual analyses in this collection will undoubtedly
be of great interest to linguists and Southeast Asian specialists who engage
similar texts in their scholarly work, the epistemological and communicative
implications raised here speak to a diverse audience across many disciplines.
The themes explored in this collection regarding the deeply social nature
of all languaging are of potential interest to many of us who engage others
in dialogue in both teaching and research relationships and within other
human systems. <I>Beyond Translation</I> invites us to speculate about
non-distant &quot;translations&quot; in everyday encounters as we consider
the professional languages we employ. Other readers will undoubtedly see
both more and less than I have in Becker's work. Most importantly for me,
this work draws attention to how the process of studying and representing
others must include some awareness of one's own self as part of this process,
thereby encouraging new dialogic possibilities. </FONT></P>
