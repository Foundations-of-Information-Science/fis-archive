<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>A synthetic generic model is proposed for the emergence
and possible evolution toward complexity and autonomy, for natural self-organizing
systems far from equilibrium. The high degree of generality of the model
is essentially due to two reasons. The first is the use of an extension
of the standard physicalist positivist epistemology: instead of considering
the &quot;ultimate reality&quot; as made up of stock and fluxes of matter
and energy (&quot;cm-g-sec world&quot;), we consider two irreducible, non-separable
and equally important primordial categories: objects (of which energy-matter
is a manifestation) and relations (of which information is a manifestation)
whose combination gives rise to the existing totality (whole). The second
basis of our model is a dual principle governing change in nature: the
first part of this principle is the general trend of the physical objects
toward the more probable, which is formalized by the spontaneous increase
of entropy of isolated systems; the second part is the existence of a relation
obstacle to this trend, which is circular causality, that is operational
closure and self-reference.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>From these foundations, we obtain a metamodel consisting
of three patterns describing the dynamic of natural systems: 1) A spiral
pattern for the four recurrent phases of self-organization (morphogenesis
leading to complexity). 2) A helix pattern for the long term evolution
toward autonomy. 3) A pattern formed by the six cycles which describing
the functioning of viable systems.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>This contribution ends with the application of the
six cycles pattern to the human being and to a cognitive system. This last
example gives an opportunity to clarify the interpretation of the words:
brain, mind, thought, consciousness.</FONT></I></P>
