</SUP><I>Language, Structure and Change: Frameworks of Meaning in Psychotherapy<BR>
By Jay S. Efran, Michael D. Lukens and Robert J. Lukens<SUP>1</SUP></I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This book is a major attempt, and a successful one, at
putting psychotherapeutic practices on a solid epistemological basis, going
beyond a naive pragmatism. This effort could not have been more timely,
given the current tendency for therapy to be a set of procedures dictated
more by the market in which psychotherapy takes place, than by any sound
theoretical approach. The whole process goes, of course, disguised as one
driven by a pragmatic &quot;hands on&quot; approach, which blindly perpetuates
the ideology of the free market, the equivalent in the professional domain
of the &quot;realpolitik&quot; now reigning undisputed since &quot;history&quot;
has supposedly ended and humankind is marching coherently toward the ideal
of an unexamined life, finally freed from childish utopias of a world with
fewer inequalities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In their endeavor to go &quot;beyond the immediate and
the practical&quot;, Efran, Lukens and Lukens follow the call of Gregory
Bateson to look for a sounder epistemological basis for the social sciences,
one more fitted to deal with the world of words, symbols and meanings that
make for their everyday materials of design, than to the material world
that a Newtonian epistemology was so successful in accounting for. In their
search for basic epistemological concepts, the authors discard the traditional
paradigm of objectivity of a positivistic traditional view of science,
and choose instead a paradigm of autonomy to account for our operation
as living systems whose lives take place in a world of meaning - in conversation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The authors&acute; view of the fundamental role of language
in human affairs is amply based on the theories on the organization of
living systems, and the epistemology that follows it, of the Chilean biologist
and neurophilosopher Humberto Maturana. This is a relevant choice that
deserves special attention. One of its consequences is that the authors
choose an embodied view of language. Thus, they are again building on a
tradition cultivated by both Gregory Bateson and the cybernetics movement
- a tradition of employing language that goes beyond a Cartesian dualism,
which bridges nature and culture, the biological and the social. Paradoxically,
Cartesian dualism is now resurfacing in some of the criticisms of cybernetics
which focus on its early choice of engineering and biological metaphors
in order to disqualify its impact in social sciences, especially since
its second order turn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Another consequence of the choice of the authors for Maturana&acute;s
theories as a meta-stance for psychotherapy is their implicit refusal to
follow the fashion in a therapeutic field that, too frequently, processes
theories with a speed modeled on TV zapping, and too often creates, maintains
or perpetuates polarities without enough theoretical in-depth discussion.
As an expression of that fashion, an intellectual avant-garde of the therapeutic
field - mainly based in the family therapy arena - long ago abandoned the
work of Gregory Bateson as part of its prehistory, and rejected the work
of Humberto Maturana and second order cybernetics as an infantile illness.
Having dismissed Bateson&acute;s work, this intellectual avant-garde demonizes
Maturana&acute;s work as a mechanical, biological, individually based expression
of modernism. Subsequently, they embrace new gurus of a post-modern social
constructionism and narrative therapy, who will most probably experience
a similar fate. Efran, Lukens and Lukens&acute; work demonstrates that
a more thorough job could be done with theories before discarding them.
They go beyond the superficial love affair that at some point saw an attractive
language for psychotherapy in Maturana&acute;s epistemology, but left it
as a vague point of reference without ever clearly building the intermediate
links between his theory of the organization of the living world and the
world of meaning in everyday life that matters in psychotherapeutic endeavors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The authors, seeing psychotherapy as a specialized form
of dialogue inquiring into frameworks of meaning, critically review some
of the milestones in the development of the field, demolishing all the
assumptions about therapy as science and showing the uncertainty pervading
every aspect of a practice which has focused alternatively on concepts
going from the biochemical to the intrapsychic, from behaviors to cognitions,
from the individual to the family and from interpersonal emotions to the
sociology of communication. They argue that all these conceptions have
been more self-fulfilling than self-correcting, and all of them have been
dissociated from a practice that the authors locate in language as a form
of action.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>They also present, very clearly argued and linked to examples
of both psychotherapeutic practice and everyday life, the main tenets of
Maturana&acute;s cosmovision. Their review covers the concepts of autopoiesis
as the organization of living systems, structure determinism, the informational
closure of living systems, and also objectivity and its traps, while introducing
the concepts of objectivity between parenthesis&acute;(which they prefer
to call &quot;in quotation marks&quot;), life as a purposeless drift, structural
coupling, and language as communal action which creates domains of distinctions.
The authors build on these concepts to show how self-reference plays a
role in the construction of problems, how language creates an observing
self that recursively modifies experience, and what is the role of consensus
in living together, if we assume that consensus does not confer objectivity.
Particularly compelling is the authors&acute; presentation of how client-therapy
interactions create new outcomes - which are often unexpected - and how
free will, choice and self-control are also created in language, together
with purpose and meaning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The psychotherapy that the authors practice becomes more
visible in their discussion of how we become the stories we tell each other
and ourselves, in order to organize our lives in permanent structural drift.
Their practice, illustrated through many vignettes, creatively challenges
the tendency for explanations to become confused with the phenomena they
are supposed to explain, thus making room for alternative stories to unfold.
As a part of this reflective stance, they show how to &quot;get free of
the semantic cycle of false causes&quot;, &quot;how to move beyond concepts
like cause, purpose and blame&quot;, and how to avoid dormitive principles
that frequently lock problems in place - preventing the emergence of alternative
views. The core notion of negotiation of boundaries and events by the members
of a community is at the center of the authors&acute; therapeutic practice.
Thus, they give instances of how they embody this central concept in their
management of time, fees, scheduling and other traditionally controversial
matters for the psychotherapist, and they introduce the analogy of the
therapist as a &quot;court jester&quot; who implements techniques to foster
reflection in a challenging but friendly way. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a field that has made the &quot;emotional&quot; its
specialty without subtly reflecting on &quot;it&quot;, the authors&acute;
view of wants and desires as more related to bodyhood than to systems of
logic is particularly refreshing. Of course, this perspective is grounded,
again, on Maturana&acute;s view of emotions as dispositions for actions
always intertwined with language in human conversations. Thus, they consistently
reframe therapy as the attempt at getting free of the pain involved in
emotional contradictions and of designing better living arrangements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If rational choices were to govern the direction of psychotherapeutic
theory and practice, and well-argued positions were to guide practitioner&acute;s
preferences, &quot;Language, Structure and Change&quot; would undoubtedly
occupy a relevant position in putting a rather shaky field on a more solid
epistemological footing. Whether this deserved destiny will be met remains
uncertain though, because the ecological evolution of ideas is the embodiment
of complex communal processes (as this book shows so well) and unfortunately,
the times are not fruitful for reflection in the therapeutic field, wherever
the sacred cow of the market dictates the dogmas to be followed. </FONT></P>
