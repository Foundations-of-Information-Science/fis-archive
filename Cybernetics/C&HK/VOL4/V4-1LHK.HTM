<I>Virtual Logic - Fixed Points and Paradoxes</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>vir'tu.al </B>(vur'tu.al),adj. 1. <I>Archaic.</I> Of
or relating to a virtue or efficacious power; energizing. 2. Being in essence
or in effect, but not in fact; as the <I>virtual </I>rulers of a country.
-- <B>vir'tu.al'i.ty</B>(-al'i.ti),n.--<B>vir'tu.al.ly</B>,<I>adv</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I take the meaning of the word virtual in the archaic
sense. Virtual logic is not logic, it is that which energizes reason and
so brings the forms of logic and mathematics into being. Virtual logic
is not logic, nor is it the actual subject matter of the mathematics, physics
or cybernetics in which it may appear to be embedded. Virtual logic lives
in the boundary between syntax and semantics. It is the pivot that allows
us to move from one world of ideas to another. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is a column on virtual logic. That which empowers
reason is not necessarily itself reasonable or logical. There are many
ways in which we encounter this sort of virtuality. One way is to proceed
from within an apparently logical system and push its boundaries, find
its limits. Another is to arrive from without in a leap, a bound, a jump
into something new.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A word about the use of the word &quot;I&quot; in this
column.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>I am the one who says I</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>That statement applies equally well to you as to me. So
you are invited to take the I-saying in this essay as your own I-saying.
You are invited to try on the points of view to which the self-referential
pronoun points. The author him/her self tends to exfoliate into dialoguing
parts, each saying I. Please join the fugue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There will be time to explore many themes in this column.
I want to begin with some remarks about the relationship of paradoxes,
self reference, imaginary values and fixed points. This sounds like a mouthful,
but lets take it step by step.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>This statement is false</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Here is the famous paradox of Epimenides the Liar. The
statement asserts that it is false. Are we to believe it? If we believe
this statement, then we must disbelieve it. If we disbelieve it, then we
must believe it. What are we to do? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If we must either believe or disbelieve that statement,
then our only recourse is to oscillate between the possibilities of its
true and false values. Oscillation is not a bad solution. The statement
is a buzzer, a feedback loop that turns itself off when it is on and turns
itself on when it is off. The paradox creates time. (I take the creation
of time to be the creation of temporal action.) The paradox demands time
for its resolution and time is what it will get.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Must we either believe or disbelieve? <BR>
I would rather just look.<BR>
The statement can be schematized:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>S = NOT(S).</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The statement is equivalent to its own negation! <BR>
Well, why not?<BR>
I like to solve equations. Lets solve this one. Lets see,</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>S = NOT(S)<BR>
= NOT(NOT(S))<BR>
= NOT(NOT(NOT(S)))<BR>
...</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Are we getting anywhere? The key to solving math equations
is to get the unknown (S) on only one side of the equation. Here the S
on the right hand side keeps getting buried deeper and deeper. I know!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Lets send it to infinity! That will fix its wagon. It
will never get back from there:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>S = NOT(NOT(NOT(NOT(NOT(....))))).</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So this &quot;paradox&quot; is no paradox at all. It is
just an infinite hall of NOT mirrors. Paradox does not generate time. Paradox
generates INFINITY! Perfect, eternal timeless infinity. How satisfying.
Not an oscillation in sight. And as for the value of S? It is neither true
nor false. It just is. It NOTS itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Are you sure you mean that it <B>nots</B> itself? Don't
you mean that it <B>knots</B> itself? I have a vision of this statement
all entangled with its own assertions? Well that would seem to be the contents
of another column. Lets go back to the equation solving.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>All right, I have another problem with your method of
solving equations. Is it legitimate to let the <B>S</B> disappear to infinity?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Well, you can do this in mathematics. For example, consider
the equation <B>X = 1 + aX.</B> I will solve it in the same way.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>X= 1 + aX<BR>
= 1+ a(1+aX)<BR>
= 1 + a + a2X<BR>
= 1 + a +a2(1+aX)<BR>
=1 + a + a2 + a3X<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+0>...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So you see, the solution by letting<B> X </B>slip off
to infinity on the right hand side is the infinite sum</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>X = 1 + a + a2 + a3 + a4 + ... </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This infinite sum certainly solves our equation:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>1 + a(1 + a + a2 + a3 + a4 + ... ) = 1 + a + a2 + a3
+ a4 + ...</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>and it does this for specific numbers! For example, if
a = 1/2 then X= 2 since 2 = 1 + (1/2)2. And we all understand that </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>2 = 1 + (1/2) + (1/2)2 + (1/2)3 + (1/2)4 + ... </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Wait! Do we understand this? Let me see. First I step
halfway towards two from one. Then I step half the remaining distance.
Then I step half the still remaining distance. Hey! This goes on forever.
I can never reach two! You mathematicians. I suppose you want me to imagine
taking an infinite number of steps. Anyway, how did we get here? Isn't
this Zeno's Paradox? I thought we were discussing the paradox of the Liar.
You started us down a slippery slope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Indeed! In fact, lets look at another value for a. Let
a=-1. Then our equation is X= 1 - X or X+X = 1. Thus X=1/2. (You cannot
complain about this method of solution. I did it in a finite number of
allowed steps.) Now lets apply our infinity to this. We get</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>1/2 = 1 + (-1) + (-1)2 + (-1)3 + (-1)4 + ... </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>1/2 = 1 -1 + 1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 + ...</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Oh no! This is even worse than Zeno. In fact now I will
show you the error of your ways. Let Z = 1 -1 + 1 -1 +1 -1 +1 -1 + ....
Then clearly Z = 1 - Z hence Z=1/2. but we also have</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Z = (1 -1) + (1 -1) +(1 -1) +(1 -1) + .... <BR>
= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + ...<BR>
= 0</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So 1/2 =0. This is as bad as the Liar paradox.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Well, I think we have done well today. <I>We have seen
that Zeno's paradox and the Liar Paradox are really part of one structure.
</I>This structure can even leap to correct answers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I will leave you with something to ponder for the next
time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I can solve any equation! <BR>
For example, lets try to solve</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Z= F(Z).</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Let <B>G(X) = F(X(X)).<BR>
</B>Then <B>G(G) = F(G(G)).<BR>
</B>So <B>Z=G(G).<BR>
</B>We have done it.<BR>
Any self referential equation can be solved.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This <B>G</B> is a lovely gremlin. She duplicates anyone
you give her and inserts the copies neatly inside <B>F</B>. Why if you
let <B>F(X) =NOT(X)</B> then <B>G(G) = NOT(G(G))</B>, and we did not even
need infinity! View Figure 1.</FONT></P>

<TABLE BORDER=2 >
<TR>
<TD><B><FONT SIZE=+0>The Incredible Duplicating Gremlin</FONT></B>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>G(#) = F(#(#))</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Apply G to herself and she replicates herself inside F.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>G(G) = F(G(G))</FONT></B></P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Figure 1</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>How did that happen without using infinity?<BR>
I thought you were going to solve it with </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Z = F(F(F(...))).</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Is <B>G(G) = F(F(F(F(...))))</B>?<BR>
What does <B>G(G)</B> mean anyway?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Stay tuned for the next episode when we follow the adventures
of the self replicating gremlin <B>G </B>from paradox to imaginary values,
G&ouml;del's theorem and the structure of DNA.</FONT></P>
