        Systems science ; Living systems ; <a
        href="../../thesaurus/wholeness.htm">Wholeness</a> ;
        Social thinking</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Whether we know it or not, systemic
        processes hold sway in the development of society, the
        same as they do in the evolution of nature. The new
        sciences of complex systems and evolution, cybernetics,
        general system theory, the theory of dynamical systems
        (known as chaos theory), and general evolution theory,
        among others, tell us that, whatever their nature,
        complex systems evolve with an underlying logic of their
        own. This evolution is not haphazard, though it is not
        entirely predictable. It does have an underlying
        direction; a probability that, following any basic
        transformation, certain kinds of states and conditions
        will come about.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Today we live in an epoch of critical
        thres-holds, and thus of basic transformations. In
        consequence the dynamic of basic evolutionary processes
        becomes unusually relevant. This dynamic is toward
        greater and greater structural complexity expressed by
        the convergence of the existing systems toward new,
        higher-level systems formed by their mutual relations;
        toward greater dynamism due to the availability, through
        ever more powerful technologies, of growing quantities of
        free energy; toward more and more direct and complex
        forms of communication among the diverse parts of the
        system brought about by the new technologies of
        information and communication; and toward a condition of
        transforming and potentially creative chaos, with
        enhanced sensitivity to other systems in the
        surroundings, societies, cultures, enterprises, and the
        ecologies and life-support systems of the biosphere.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">There may not be much we can do to go
        counter to the basic evolutionary trends; our interests
        lie with going with it, facilitating their unfolding. But
        what good would it do us if we evolved a system of
        interacting and interdependent societies if in that
        system there was a dictatorship of the rich and the
        powerful; if the great majority lived at or below the
        margins of basic human subsistence; if nature became
        inhospitable; if resources turned scarce; if life was
        harsh and competition unfettered; and if violence was
        rampant and might was right? Such a world is entirely
        possible, but reaching it is not in our interest. On the
        other hand creating a more equitable and generous world
        is equally possible, and doing so is within our power.
        Moving toward this positive path of our collective
        evolution calls for recognizing the real imperatives of
        our day. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Evolving a planetary consciousness is
        among these imperatives. With the current level of
        consciousness in society, diplomatic negotiations, legal
        and administrative measures, and armed military or police
        actions show little success, they often produce more
        problems than they solve. They constitute superficial
        short-term tinkerings with long-term basic problems.
        Enduringly effective solutions call for a different kind
        of thinking and a different kind of commitment. It is
        becoming increasingly evident that such thinking and
        commitment cannot be achieved without the evolution of
        people압 individual and collective consciousness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If we are to cope with the problems
        that face us today and in coming years, the consciousness
        of today압 women and men must rise from the ego- and
        nation-centered dimension to a global and planet-centered
        one. In this regard it still has a long way to grow. In
        many societies the dominant consciousness is beset by a
        layer of egotism, misplaced nationalism, and cultural
        chauvinism. The result is the persistence of social and
        political narrow-mindedness, economic warfare, cultural
        intolerance, and disregard for the environment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">How can we evolve a more adequate
        consciousness? The question is not as arcane as it may
        seem: when people sense that a core belief system is a
        threat to themselves and their children, they search for
        alternative ideas, values, and beliefs. This is happening
        today. Despite the persistence of outdated myths and
        illusions in the established layers of society, there is
        an impassioned search for alternatives at the margins.
        The rise of inner-city deprivation and violence, the
        drift toward anarchy and the impotence of police and
        military measurs to cope with it, the dissolution of the
        social contract between society and the worker, the
        spread of drug addiction and of esoteric cults, the rise
        of unemployment and homelessness are so many signs of a
        decline that does not fail to leave its mark on people압
        beliefs and priorities. The old order is breaking apart,
        and its coming demise motivates young people, and
        open-minded persons of all ages, to look for better and
        more reliable visions and values.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The truly promising signs of our times
        include the coming of a spiritual renaissance, hallmarked
        by an intense search for new values, new principles, and
        new visions to live by. The Pathfinder Project, an
        internationally networked project of the Institute of
        Noetic Sciences of California, summed up these trends
        under the following headings:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>Creating a home for humanity within
        nature:</i> Revisioning of humanity's place within nature
        and the cosmos, together with a multitude of creative
        efforts to design human activity in consonance with
        ecosystemic principles and environmental limits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>Local and global self-organization:</i>
        Simultaneous proliferation of creative initiatives at the
        local and global level, including the revitalization of
        civic society, the cultivation of new forms of community,
        and the emergence of effective global institutions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>From outer to inner authority:</i>
        Realization of the primacy of consciousness as a causal
        reality and a corresponding shift from reliance on outer
        sources of authority to a trust in inner sources of
        knowing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>From separation to wholeness:</i>
        Recognition of the fundamental wholeness and
        interconnectedness of all aspects of reality and
        experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>Awakening spirituality:</i> Widening
        search for ways to revitalize spiritual practice and
        nurture a sense of spiritual community, together with
        growing exploration of the role of spirit in such areas
        as health, business, and public life.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>From centralized to
        &quot;acentric&quot; power:</i> A shift from
        relationships, systems, and institutions based on
        centralized power to perspectives and approaches that
        emphasize peoples capacity for creative self-organization
        and learning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>From mechanistic to living systems:</i>
        A related shift from models of the world, organizations,
        and human experience based on mechanistic systems, to
        perspectives and approaches based on the principles that
        inform living systems.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>From greed and scarcity to
        sufficiency and caring:</i> A further shift from values,
        perspectives, and approaches based on greed and scarcity
        to those based on a sense of sufficiency and caring.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>From competition to reconciliation
        and partnership:</i> Last but not least, a shift from
        relationships, organizational models, and societal
        strategies based on competition to those based on
        principles of healing, reconciliation, and professional
        as well as male/female partnership.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">These trends suggest that a new
        consciousness is surfacing at the cutting edge of
        society. But how influential are the new trends and how
        fast will they spread? Will they be powerful enough to
        move to center stage and impact on the way the great
        majority of the people live, and the way managers and
        politicans make decisions? The answer is by no means
        clear. Helping to articulate and spread the emerging
        consciousness is a major cause, worthy of the best minds
        of our day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We need another Apollo mission, not on
        the plane of technology this time, but on the plane of
        culture. The deepest wellsprings of human motivation must
        be mobilized: wellsprings that have always nurtured the
        creativity of artists, writers, and women and men of the
        spirit. In great art and literature, and in the deepest
        foundations of the spiritual sphere there is love for and
        solidarity with our fellow humans and empathy with
        nature. In these areas we find a wealth of insight that
        goes beyond superficial rhetoric to the substance of deep
        feeling and clear intuition. Creative people in all
        spheres of contemporary culture could teach our eye to
        see, our ears to hear, and our mind to absorb the new
        realities that unfold in our changing times. Their
        message could go beyond our brains to reach our hearts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The stakes are high. Without an
        evolution of our individual and collective consciousness
        it is unlikely that we could avert deepening economic,
        social, and cultural conflicts and ecologic breakdowns.
        But with the evolution of our consciousness from the ego-
        and nation-centered toward the global- and
        planet-centered dimension we would have a real prospect
        of matching the growth of our technological
        sophistication with corresponding intellectual insight
        and emotional maturity. We would have a chance to muster
        the will and the motivation to use our technologial
        powers and our social creativity to bring us and our
        children to a soft-landing in the post-modern world of
        the next millennium.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><b>The Mission of the Club of Budapest</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The Club of Budapest is committed to
        promoting and facilitating a worldwide movement keynoted
        by the advance from thinking in terms of the existing

        pursues this crucial objective by motivating and
        highlighting the unfolding of the consciousness, the
        thinking, feeling, and perceptions of contemporary
        people, through a set of highly focused and coordinated
        yet autonomously managed projects, implemented with the
        advice and active participation of its Members, its

        <p><font size="3">This is not a mission impossible. It is

        <p><font size="3">At the turn of the 21st century we live
        in an epoch of transition; witnessing the deepest and
        fastest transformation in the history of humanity. This
        transformation is not without crises and difficulties,
        the birthpangs of a coming age. Today hundreds of
        millions are without work; a thousand million or more are
        exploited by poor wages; three thousand million are
        forced into growing poverty. On the one hand the
        population of the world is growing, on the other the
        number of jobs is diminishing. The gap between rich and
        poor economies, and between rich and poor people within
        nations, is increasing. The problems of the environment,
        the same as those of society, confront all people. Yet,
        though the world community is relieved of the specter of
        superpower confrontation and is threatened by ecological
        collapse and socioeconomic polarization, national
        governments still spend a thousand billion dollars a year
        on arms and the military and only a tiny fraction of this
        sum on socially conscious development and a livable
        environment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The ecological problem, the employment
        problem, the developmental problem, the population
        problem, the armaments problem, and the many problems of
        energies and resources will not be overcome merely by
        reducing the number of already useless nuclear warheads,
        nor by signing politically softened treaties on world
        trade, dangerous technologies, global warming, biological
        diversity, and sustainable development. More is required
        today than piecemeal action and short-term
        problem-solving. The fact is that, as Einstein remarked,
        one cannot solve a problem with the same kind of thinking
        that gave rise to it. The critical factor in coping with
        today압 mushrooming problems is the thinking of today압
        people. The approaching crises we face are due to ways of
        thinking and acting that lag behind the needs of the
        times.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Updating and upgrading our ways of
        thinking and acting is a challenging task, but not an
        intractable one. The required concepts are largely known,
        the indicated technologies and practices are for the most
        part already developed. The missing factor is the
        commitment of people young and old to the indicated
        objectives, and their willingness to adopt the
        corresponding practices. If this hiatus is to be filled,
        more is required than intellectual understanding alone.
        Such understanding can enable us to grasp the issues and
        potential solutions, but cannot give us the will and the
        motivation to act on them. Intellectual understanding
        must be undergirded by feeling and intuition, by fresh
        values and a new commitment. When all is said and done,
        we come to a basic insight: we need a more evolved
        consciousness. Entering the 21st century with the
        consciousness that hallmarked the 20th century would be
        like entering the modern age with the consciousness of
        the Middle Ages. It would be not only inappropriate, but
        dangerous.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Having a consciousness that is in tune
        with our times means evolving it to the dimension where
        we can understand as well as feel our new, more embracing
        relations with each other and with nature. It calls for
        planetary consciousness. Evolving it is not a
        supernatural feat, nor is it one reserved for individuals
        of exceptional endowment. It does not mean knowing
        everything about everything, nor does it mean counting in
        terms of millions or billions, whether of numbers of
        people, hectars of land, or barrels of oil. Rather, it
        means openness to new ideas, sensitivity to emerging
        dangers as well as opportunities, and the ability to
        apprehend the humanistic and sustainable values and
        priorities that can, and must, shape the next century.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Many people are already evolving their
        consciousness to the required planetary dimension; many
        more would do so if made aware of the need and given the
        opportunity. The Club of Budapest is dedicated to the
        proposition that promoting and facilitating the evolution
        of planetary consciousness is a vital aspect of our
        sustained well-being and individual as well as social
        development. It is an essential mission of our time.</font></p>
