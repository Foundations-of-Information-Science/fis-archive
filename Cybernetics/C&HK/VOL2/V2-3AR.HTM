</I>Cooperative Methods in the Development of Human Knowing: Foundation
of a New Research Center</H3>

<P>The development of human knowing by scientific research has taken a
path, which seems unfortunate in certain respects. The knowledge explosion
and information overload are fundamental problems, which often lead to
overspecialisation. This creates a need for interdisciplinary research,
but here the problems of information overload are even more overwhelming.
Cooperation is indicated, but the increasingly competitive atmosphere in
science apears to be inappropriate for the purpose. Instead it seems necessary
to interact &quot;in a kind, caring and positive manner in order to create
and nurture the most positive spirit, friendly fellowship and crosscultural/crossdisciplinary
understanding&quot; (auotation from G. Lasker at the International Symposium
on Systems Research Informatics and Cybernetics, Baden-Baden, Germany,
1993).</P>

<P>In order to realize these ideas in research work the International Center
for Interdisciplinary Research in Psychiatry was founded in 1992. The Center
is organized as a &quot;Center Without Walls&quot;, i.e. a cooperation
between persons (not necessarily directly interested in psychiatry) who
may well be distributed al over the world. Likewise the facilities may
be widely distributed. Right now the Center has some facilities in Denmark,
including an interdisciplinary library with working space, machines for
communication and space for smaller meetings.</P>

<P>So far the Center has worked mainly with ideas (see further below) and
it has been possible for each member to cober his own expenses, helped
by bursaries and a donation. The independence of the Center is laid down
in its statutes, according to which financial support may only be accpted,
if it is completely without &quot;strings attached&quot;. It is difficult
to foresee the development of the Center's financial situation in the future,
but we anticipate that the means may be restricted (at least for periods)
so that the Center will not ve able to pay salaries. Working members may
be holders of bursaries, (early) pensioners, students, workers on sabbatical
etc. and it is possible to work with other institutes, e.g. on experimental
projects.</P>

<P>Such external conditions impose limitations, but may also facilitate
the creation of a research milieu, where cooperation is encouraged an competition
is restricted to sound forms. As mentioned above we believe that there
is a need for such milieux, such niches in the contemporary scientific
community.</P>

<P>The Center is open to persons from all field of research, and it now
has 15 members, who represent specialist knowledge in the following disciplines:
Psychiatry (including psycho-therapy, occupational therapy and psychopharamacology),
General Medicine, Chemistry, Psychology, Media Research, Ethology, Epistemology,
Research Methodology, Cybernetics, Logic and Law. We try to develop a base
of special interdisciplinary knowledge.</P>

<P>Ideas studied curently are in the following subject areas: possible
roles of psychopathology in processes of defense, adaptation and self-regulation
(S&oslash;rensen and Randrup, 1992); dopamine and glutamate in developing
psychoses (Randrup, 1990; Munkvad 1951); occupational therapy (Seki, 1990);
space and time, interdisciplinary and psychiatric aspects (Marchais and
Randrup, 1991) and spirituality. The main idea is to integrate these various
studies by means of interdisciplinary methods, i.a. the &quot;systemal
method&quot; of P. Marchais (Marchais and Randrup, 1986).</P>

<P>At the moment the cooperative work on spirituality (and meditation,
contemplation etc.) is particularly active. We study types and phenomenology
of spiritual experience and the relations of spirituality to: mental and
general health, physiology, evolution, societal problems (including &quot;spiritual
democracy&quot; and social ecology), anthropology, mind-matter problems
and the development of human knowing. This research applies scientific
methods, but admittedly this subject has led us to the borders of science
and may eventually indicate a more comprehensive conception of human knowing.
</P>

<P>The Center may regarded as an experiment, and we anticipate that many
problems and difficulties will arise. We also anticipate that the work
with these problems may lead to original results and to a new and useful
working style.</P>
