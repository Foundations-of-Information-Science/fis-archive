<I>Cultural Change and Ethical Responsibilities of the Scientists</I></H3>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The following paper is the fruit of personal research
carried out in the course of my work at the Forward Studies Unit. It in
no way reflects the official positions of either the Commission or the
President.</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>1. Science is changing in a changing society</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The Commission organised recently in Oxford a small &quot;Carrefour
de la Science et de la Culture&quot; bringing into contact high level members
of the Commission with Nobel prizes in different Sciences. There was a
long exchange on the changes in Science and in society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>My hypothesis is that there is an important change in
the scientific paradigm but that this change is occurring in a more global
and broader cultural change.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>1.1. Changes in scientific paradigm</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Recent developments in Science, like the research of Prigogine,
but already of Heisenberg, show that one part of the scientists have been
forced through their research to abandon the hope to discover a true and
adequate description of universal and exact laws of nature. Nature as Prigogine
notes is neither transparent, previsible, manipulable, nor stable, and
humans (scientists) must cease to consider themselves as &quot;objective&quot;
observers out of time and space. If one agrees with this new vision of
science one must draw a major consequence : scientific rationality cannot
any more pretend to be in possession of the true laws of nature... of they
exist. Rationality has lost its privilege of having direct access to the
truth i.e. of objectivity and neutrality. &quot;Exact&quot; science is
thus more similar to other human sciences. It has a more humble and progressive
(asymptotic) approach of the truth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But if science is not any more &quot;neutral&quot; nor
&quot;objective&quot;, it most accept to be &quot;in&quot; and not &quot;above&quot;
ethics and politics. Scientists are thus invited to accept that they cannot
escape their social, political and ethical responsibilities. It is normal
that society asks scientists to give account of their options and choices.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>2. Malaise of some scientists</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Some scientists resent those new demands about their responsibilities
as a plot against science. They have sometimes the impression to be submitted
to a new trial of Galilei. They judge the critics against science as obscurantistic
refusals of scientific rationality, and as a return to the Middle Ages.
Their reaction is thus to start campaigns of &quot;explanations&quot; in
order to combat what they feel to be ignorance, backwardness and lack of
information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is probably true that some criticisms have a real anti-rational
tone. Our hypothesis though is that the main reason for this change of
behaviour in the public is not at all a plot against science but an important
cultural change of our world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>3. What cultural change</B>?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>According to our analysis the cultural change is much
broader than the changing in the scientific paradigm, although the changing
of status of the scientific rationality is an important element of it.
Other important elements of this change are:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>The transition towards the <I>&quot;information society&quot;</I>,
which presupposes an important change in human relations, precisely because
of the new possibilities of those new electronic tools. As industrial society
was characterised by the importance of capital, of the quantitative element,
by analytic approach, and money efficiency, it seems that in this new society
information will be more important than capital, qualitative approach will
prevail over quantitative, holistic approach will use analysis but be prevalent
over it. Meaning and signification will slowly prevail over efficiency...</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>This new possibility of communication permits also a
<I>globalization</I> of <I>information</I>. This brings also the cultures
in closer contact, and relativizes the dominance of the western cultures
over the others. We see the <I>resurrection of the cultural element</I>,
for the best and the worse. (religious wars etc...).</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Independently of those elements it is also clear that
the end of the XXth century sees the <I>roles of women and men changing</I>
fast, partly because of the possibilities of birth control.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Some sociologists also say that we are leaving slowly
the consumer society and that we are entering into a <I>society of signification</I>
(soci&eacute;t&eacute; du sens).</FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One could add other elements and there are others to be
added. What is important is to situate what is happening to science in
a broader context of cultural change. Instead of going back to the Middle
Ages, we are going in fact towards a new type of society. The difficulty
is precisely that the new paradigm being more holistic, resembles to some
extent the uni-fying paradigm of premodernity (Middle Ages) but without
the authoritarian-vertical aspect of it. The confusion is thus understandable,
but it is a confusion that has to be clarified.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If one accepts that we are changing the social paradigm,
a changing of the status of science becomes an acceptable hypothesis. Moral
responsibilities of the scientists become self evident as for any other
human beings.</FONT></P>
