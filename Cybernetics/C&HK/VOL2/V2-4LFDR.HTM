<i>Towards a Biological Explanation of Human Understanding</i></h3>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>We subscribe to the view, expressed by Maturana and others,
that a satisfying experience of understanding does not result
from invoking objectivity, the truth, or a compelling argument,
to achieve agreement by the force of reason, nor from a process
of information exchange, but from some other qualities of the
biological interaction itself. We experience some dissatisfaction
when the &quot;force of reason&quot; viewpoint is not
acknowledged, but is a hidden agenda, in discussions. To address
our frustration and this issue in human coexistence, we employ
secondorder cybernetics, in particular the biological explanatory
framework of Maturana, Varela and others, to speak about the
process of human understanding. We also introduce some ideas
about behavioural confidence and structural coupling which are
derived from animal studies and contrast quantitative attributes
of behaviour with qualitative attributes of emotion, in which
case metaphor seems especially useful. The satisfaction we derive
from this is seen as part of our own understanding. </p>
