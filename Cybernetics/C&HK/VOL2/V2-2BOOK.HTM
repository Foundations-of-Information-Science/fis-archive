<I>Book Review&nbsp;</I></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The subject of this short monograph (English + Italian
= 160 pages) is the author's extension to the models of the Italian Operative
School, a school whose existence was hitherto unknown to this reviewer
(and hence what you read here about it I got from the book). The translation
(by the author) is quite good, though I wish he had translated many more
of the quotations. This school, whose proponents include S. Ceccata, E.
von Glasersfeld, V. Somenzi and G. Vaccarino, apparently has as its main
tenet the necessity of a process-oriented model for the understanding of
mental activity (which I find most applaudable). The major focus of the
author's analysis is language and meaning, and perhaps there is something
here for those so inclined. The introduction contains the standard castigation
of various philosophers and schools thereof for fuzzy thinking, and, as
is usual with any model of mind, makes vast claims for its value and applicability
(a sin which this reviewer as well has committed!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The central process (or activity, if you will) in the
model is attentional <I>movement</I> a sensory input does not `exist' if
the sensor in question is not the focus of the attention movement mechanism.
The author here is in contact with a profound idea - that information arises
from change, but does not carry this through on a cybernetic level. The
author emphasizes that `mental objects' necessarily must have a fleeting
existence, and hence mental objects which require continuous mental presence
require that the model postulate a sort of `polling' of the focus on the
sensors/mental objects in question. This, together with the fact that the
model does not contain itself (ie. the mechanism of attentional movement
- the author's `doors' and `keys'), are in my view major weaknesses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In general, the model proposes a more-or-less standard,
feed-back based, function-composition hierarchy for sensory-motor control
and mental abstraction. James S. Albus' Brains, Behavior, and Robotics
[BYTE Books, ca. 1988] contains a considerably longer and more detailed
attempt in this direction. However, both Albus' and the present book's
attempts, while noble, are unconvincing.</FONT></P>
