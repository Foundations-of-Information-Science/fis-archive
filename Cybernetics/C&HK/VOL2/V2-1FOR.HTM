FOREWORD</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second volume of Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing opens with a paper
of Klaus Krippendorff attempting to lay the foundation for a second order
understanding of communication and the function of its metaphors. One of
his major proposals is that <I>&quot;communication becomes a social phenomenon
precisely when its participants recognize or construct in their understanding
of communication the understanding of communication of those they communicate
with, when their communication theory recursively embeds the communication
theories of Others, and when the participating communicators are thereby
enabled to see themselves through the eyes of Others.&quot;</I></P>

<P>The paper &quot;What Happens When We Make a Distinction&quot; by the
belated David Herbst has waited for many years to be published. We are
proud to be able to publish this introduction to the thoughts of a man
who's work has been compared with C.S. Peirce's and Spencer Brown's. Paal
Rasmussen has written a short introduction.</P>

<P>Where theory and praxis meet in teaching through the second order reflection
on both, Shoshana Keiny writes about the changes in teachers conception
of students and teaching in the Environmental-Education and Science Technology
and Society program in Yerucham, Israel.</P>

<P>Finally David Johnson continues the discussion with Ernst von Glasersfeld
on radical constructivism and ontology from vol.1, no.4, and we have a
call for papers from the &quot;Fourth International Conference on Principles
of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning&quot;.</P>

<P>If you have not paid for the second volume of the journal, this is the
last issue you will receive. Remember that the economy of this journal
is still weak. Please pay your subscription now and make your library subscribe.</P>
