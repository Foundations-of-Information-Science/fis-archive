<I>Towards a Theory of the Artificial</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>All artificial devices are machines, but not all machines are artificial
devices. This is the starting point for a proposal aimed at establishing
the basis for a Theory of the Artificial (TA). On the one hand we have
a conventional technology, aimed at helping man to survive by controlling
the world. On the other, we have a technology oriented at reproducing some
existing reality. We would name the latter technology the technology of
the artificial.</P>

<P>While natural and also conventional technological objects have an autonomous
and independent 'existence status' of their own, the artificial wouldn't
have any meaning without its reference to something natural or, in any
case, without reference to something man assumes as a reproduction exemplar.
The need for a theory comes both from scientific and from practical interests.
According to the former we have to understand the artificial in order to
discriminate it from the purely technological activity and try to understand
also their different anthropological roots and intellectual motivations.
According to the latter, we have to understand the different requirements
needed for the use of conventional machines as compared to the 'use' of
artificial devices. The intensity of today's technology, both artificial
and conventional, makes such theoretical work legitimate both on technical
grounds and also because of its urgency socially and culturally. </P>
