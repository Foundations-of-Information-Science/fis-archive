<p>As this issue is the last one of volume 2, it is the time to
give your self and your friends a subscription to volume 3 for
Christmas present.</p>

<p>The journal is now sold in 42 countries and states and we are
still developing our concept. The quality and amount of papers we
are receiving are still growing, and I look forward to publish
those many papers already in process, among which is an English
translation of a work on autopoiesis by Niklas Luhmann.</p>

<p>From volume 3, no.1 we will start a new tradition with a
regular &quot;columnist&quot;. In this regular column, Ranulph
Glanville (from the Portsmouth School of Architecture) will bring
out and discuss fundamental problems in (second order)
cybernetics with the purpose of starting a written discussion in
the journal about these issues. The style will be short,
provocative and poignant. The basic idea is that cybernetics
needs to look into itself again to find its own strength. In the
last part of this issue we publish a short introductory article.</p>

<p>In the present issue Lloyd Fell and David Russell write about
the use of Maturana and Varela's view of autopoiesis in the
understanding of the nature of knowledge and, among other things,
drawing on and interpreting research in animal behaviour.</p>

<p>Peter Bøgh Andersen's groundbreaking paper on linguistics not
only dives deep into the new second order area of cyber-semiotics
but also adds mathematical insight from the catastrophe theory of
René Thom.</p>

<p>Ashgar Minai is developing a new concept of aesthetics based
on the new developments within several areas of the arts, natural
and social sciences discovering a common theme for eastern and
western world views.</p>

<p>This artist of this issue is Nils Sloth.</p>

<p>My best wishes for Christmas and the New Year, and my thanks
for your support over the past year.</p>
