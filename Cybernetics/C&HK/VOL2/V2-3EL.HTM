<P><B>Alternative universes</B></P>

<P>Reality -- at least <I>our</I> reality -- takes different shapes with
the different conceptions we entertain of it. Entirely divergent conceptions
of reality are possible, and many of them have achieved explicit formulation
in the history of thought. For purposes of this analysis we group the major
kinds of systematic realities under the heading of &quot;alternative universes&quot;.
There are four of them:</P>

<OL>
<P>the mystical (mu)-universe</P>

<P>the teleological (tau)-universe</P>

<P>the random-change (phi)-universe</P>

<P>the self-forming (psi)-universe.</P>
</OL>

<P>The origins of the (mu)-universe go back to the dawn of human intellectual
history, with roots in both Eastern and Western thought. It was Plato who
introduced it into systematic philosophy. Plato embraced the mystical tenet
that the ultimate realities subsist unchanged, on a separate plane of existence.
In the Platonic universe the things encountered in the material world arrange
themselves according to their perfect and eternal archetypes.</P>

<P>Plato's thesis is cogent, but requires the acceptance of two separate
planes of reality. Aristotle objected to this postulate and proceeded to
outline the historically powerful variant of the (tau)-universe. In Aristotle's
conception matter is inert and formless. To account for the world's known
properties we must assume the action of four distinct &quot;causes&quot;,
including the final cause which makes the universe basically teleological.
The essential forms or designs imprint themselves on perceived realities
as their &quot;entelechies&quot;. These kept cropping up time and again
-- in Driesch, in Bergson, and in the &quot;vitalist&quot; school in philosophy
and biology.</P>

<P>The (phi)-universe has an especially rich history, first within philosophy
and then in science. Its origins can be traced to the atomism of Democritus
and Leucippus. In <I>De Rerum Natura</I> the Roman poet Lucretius produced
a representative and eloquent statement of it. &quot;Multitudinous atoms,
swept along in multitudinous courses through infinite time by mutual clashes
and their own weight, came together in every possible way and realized
everything that could be formed by their combinations&quot;.</P>
