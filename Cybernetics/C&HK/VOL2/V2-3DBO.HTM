<P><B>A short introduction: Soft Constrains on genuine discourse</B></P>

<P>In earlier work (Bar-On, 1989) I discussed severe constrains on the
possibility to develop a genuine discourse, a discourse which has a absolute
<I>potential of discussbility</I>. I related first to silenced facts which
have been eliminated from the discourse but steer it in some hidden way.
They create severe restrictions on the development of genuine discourse
because we have no clear way to retrieve them into the discourse, making
them discussible. While there are many issues we do not discuss usually
(like cultural conventions, habits, myths and taboos), they are not causing
severe constrains on the development of genuine discourse, as they can
be retrieved into the discourse on call. The nature of the undiscussibility
of the facts I related to, was of such perceived 'negative' consequences
to certain persons' self esteem or public image, that they had to manipulate
the discourse in quite a sophisticated way in order to elominate their
traces.</P>

<P>I also presented the <I>pure ideological context</I> (Following Zizek,
1989), as a social situation in which one question in relation to facts
becomes dominant in the discourse (&quot;What should, ought, must be the
facts?&quot;). As the pure ideology is usually coupled with asymmetry of
power relations, a strong collectivity and strong sanctions against those
who do not comply, it is another form of servere constrain on the development
of genuine discourse. I did not claim that silenced facts are used predominantly
in the context of pure ideologies. I showed how an abusing father can develop
an as-if discourse in his family by making the abuse a silenced fact, and
how the other family members join in by &quot;turning their blind eye&quot;.
I finally redefined normalcy, providing three severe criteria which relate
to the severe constrains on developing genuine discourse.</P>
