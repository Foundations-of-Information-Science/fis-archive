<i>The semiotics of autopoiesis. A catastrophetheoretic approach</i></h3>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>This paper has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it suggests
ways of making autopoietic theory more precise and more
operational for concrete communication analysis. I discuss
concepts such as distinction, system, boundary, environment,
perturbation, and compensation. The explication of the concepts
is based on catastrophe theory, and in order to make them
operational I emphasise their affinity to traditional semiotics
and communication theory. On the other hand I propose changes to
the semiotic tradition in order to incorporate insights from
autopoietic theory, namely that the human condition is
characterised by the phenomenon of self-reference and therefore
also by the unavoidability of paradoxes. Firstly, this means that
truth cannot be a basic semiotic concept; instead the notion of
stability is suggested. Secondly, in order to act in a
paradoxical context, we need to unfold the paradox in time, which
again calls for a dynamic theory of meaning. </p>
