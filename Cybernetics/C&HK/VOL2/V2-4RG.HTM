<i>A (Cybernetic</i><sup><i>1 </i></sup><i>) Musing</i></h3>

<p>I have felt for a long time that Cybernetics (Systems Theory,
call it what you will - and perhaps this is part of the trouble)
has lost its way: and this upsets me, for I love Cybernetics -
the way of thinking, the openness and the way it spans
disciplines and interests: its universality, in a word<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>And, in other word, its integrity.</p>

<p>And these are what I fear have been lost.</p>

<p>In our need to show that Cybernetics is valuable, to convince
others (who perhaps don't want or need to be convinced) that
there actually is something there, we have, I believe,
accidentally sold Cybernetics out. By this I mean we have taken a
position in which we treat how to use the subject more seriously
than the subject itself: we have become corporate raiders, asset
strippers of our own subject.</p>

<p>Consider the following metaphor. We have chosen to treat
cybernetics as a tool kit. A very nice tool kit, but one where
the coherence that makes a collection of tools into a suite is
forgotten. That is, just a lot of tools, all together. And we've
taken this toolkit to a building site, and left it there for
everyone to benefit from. And everyone has benefitted. And, at
the end of the day, we've gone back, and found there aren't many
tools there: the bos which our tool kit was in has few tools in
it now, and no coherence: it's just goet a couple of odds and
ends which really don't make a set - wanted to use the tools had
finished taking the ones they wanted.</p>

<p>But everyone on the building site is happy, for they've got a
nice new tool or two.</p>

<p>Except for us. We are the loosers. Having lost the coherence
as well as the contents of our toolkit we are left with nothing.
All we can take home from the site is the nearly empty box, the
box of Cybernetics.</p>

<p>We could have looked after it. We could have asked others to
return our tools, to acknowledge they'd &quot;borrowed&quot;
them. We could have said that they were not individual tools, but
a set, a suite: something more. We could have insisted they were
ours. But we left them alone for others to take, in our desperate
need to seem important and relevant to others<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>I asked Heinz von Foerster about this a couple of years ago.
His interpretation was that there is no longer any such thng as
Cybernetics. The field has vanished. All that it had to offer has
been taken up and taken over by other subjects. The exciting way
to talk about this is to say that cybernetics is everywhere. The
sad way (sad not least because it looses us our field) is to say
that Cybernetics is dead: it has evaporated, its wisdom absorbed
into other fields without trace.</p>

<p>And if you go to conferences that are purportedly Cybernetics
or Systems Theory Conferences, you find that Cybernetics hardly
gets a look in. You will find enormous sessions on, for instance,
&quot;fuzzy&quot; (nothing necessarily wrong with fuzzy, but
fuzzy does not equal systems), or on story-telling, or whatever.
But the centre that is cybernetics is rarely approached. Where
are the papers on Cybernetics (or systems) per se? Some of the
papers presented in this peripherium even seem to ve papers that
were rejected elswhere, riding in on the tails of Cybernetics by
the addition of a note or two of token abeyance and the hope that
this slight will not be noticed (which all too often it isn't!).
We shouldn't allow ourselves to be bought so easily!</p>

<p>(And, for that matter, how many of us call ourselves
Cyberneticians - even if our jobs make this hard to do).</p>

<p>That is why, when Søren Brier asked me to contribute
something to this journal, I eagerly accepted the opportunity.
For, for me there is a chance, a slim possibility perhaps, to
revive Cybernetics if we examine it for what it is, as its self
(as a second order Object). If we will look at Cybernetics as a
worthwhile subject in its own right, we may re-discober what is
at the heart of it, the coherence that makes (and maintains) it
distinct, and the integrity that allows it to take its position
as something worthy of attention and love, and of human faith and
endeavour. (We might approach this later, for those of you who
feel this is over constructed in terms of the &quot;it&quot;. But
let me plead that there is a time to talk in a shorthand, without
having to argue every point in all its doubtable detail).</p>

<p>My project, then, is to (re-)consider different topics,
notions, themes, ideas, concepts in or attached to cybernetics. I
shall look at them to see what meaning and understanding I can
extract, derive, excavate, and I shall present these as a
quarterly musing. I shall, on occasion, let the text lead me and
follow it to a surprising result (as designers do). I shall try
to be informed, maybe even scholarly, but not to overload what I
write with reference to the trappings of over-stated academe: for
this undertaking is not an academic project of wit, but a project
of love and of understanding. If what I do is provocative, then I
shall be able to continue to hold my view that there is something
in and to Cybernetics, that there is a passion. If there is
agreement, then I shall be glad that the coherence I am trying to
find is being recognised by others. I shall start from the
official beginning, with Wiener's definition, with control and
communication in the animal and the machine.</p>

<p>My wish is not to close down but to open up, not to distract
from Cybernetics but to focus in on it, to give it the attention
I believe it deserves as an area worthy of being seriously
considered for what it is, in its own right. I shall welcome
comments and contributions whether they agree or disagree, for
they will (I hope) indicate that there's life, yet, in the old
beast. I trust, I hope not too naively, that all will be nurture.
And I hope, also, to provoke, but without malice. </p>

<p><strong>And a note about any responses:</strong></p>

<p>It may be that this series turns into something publishable,
in some form, as a collected work. Comments and contributions
that come from readers of this series will be treated as coming
with permission for their publication and inclusion in such a
work unless such permission is specifically denied when they are
submitted. If such a publication does occur, credit for such
pieces will, of course, be given.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>I use the name &quot;Cybernetics&quot; because that is
        the name for the field that I grew up with. Others prefer
        &quot;Systems&quot;. I do not mind which, and I do not
        intend to argue a priority, a line of succession, a
        prefereed orthodoxy, a super and a sub set. I just call
        it all &quot;Cybernetics&quot;.</li>
    <li>Long time members of the American Society of Cybernetics
        may remember a debate in the newsletter (&quot;Continuing
        the Conversation&quot;) published about Cybernetics and
        Utility. I was a participant, and received a good deal of
        flack for my view (expressed at that time) that the
        requirement of Utility is not important to Cybernetics,
        indeed, was counterproductive, even dangerous and
        destructive.</li>
    <li>This is not an argument against being useful. It is an
        argument against destroying a field by not taking care of
        it, by throwing away its content and coherence and,
        ultimately, its value, by becoming more interested in
        external criteria and valuations than in the nurturing of
        that field.</li>
