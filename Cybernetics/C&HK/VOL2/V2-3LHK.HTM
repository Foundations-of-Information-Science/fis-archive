<P><B>I. Introduction</B></P>

<P>There are a number of purely mathematical approaches to the theory of
games and to the matter of deciding the value of a position in a given
game at a given time in that game. In this paper I will not repeat the
wisdom of the conventional theory of games, but rather I will explore the
concept of positional evaluation on its own grounds with respect to a collection
of sample games, some mathematical in nature, and some more epistemological
or experiential. Each section of the paper can be read on its own grounds.</P>

<P>The contents of this paper are as listen below.</P>

<P>Appendix 1 - Comments on the game of Go<BR>
Appendix 2 - Principles of Quantum Mechanics<BR>
Appendix 3 - On G&ouml;del's Theorem, Self-Reproducing Machines and the
Lambda Calculu<BR>
Appendix 4 - On Knots</P>

<P>The Common theme that ties these vignettes together is the dilemma faced
by the player who needs to select a next move. The player is an observer
of the system (the game) of which he/she is a part (participant).</P>

<P>This is an essay on second order cybernetics. The observer is included
in the system. To what end is that observer in the system? To influence
to course of events. To make the system possible as an observed system.
And who is the observer? In a game these issues come to a head. The observer
is playing the game and it is through the playing of the game that the
observer comes into being.</P>
