<h3>FOREWORD</h3>

<p>We are now in the third issue of the second volume. Those who
truly wish to support this journal should pay their subscription
for the 3. vol. now by sending a check to the editor and
publisher. This issue is delayed, so this volume will end with
this year and the new volume will start with 1995 and volumes
from now on will follow the year.</p>

<p>We have added a new subtitle to the journal: A Journal of
Second Order Cybernetics &amp; Cyber-Semiotics to underline that
we are the core journal of second order cybernetics, and that one
of the ideas behind the words: Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing in
the title is to investigate the relationship between second order
cybernetics and semiotics. I have christened this field
Cyber-Semiotics. To underline this project I have asked the
semiotician Thomas Sebeok to join the editorial board, which he
kindly accepted. We have further the honour that Mary Catherine
Bateson and Peter Bøgh-Andersen (Århus University, Denmark)
have also joined the editorial board.</p>

<p>In the present issue Erwin Laszlo is writing about his new
theory of a remembering universe.</p>

<p>Louis Kaufmann writes about games, metagames and knot-logics
as a way to investigate some of the basic questions of second
order cybernetics.</p>

<p>Dan Bar-On writes about how we create inner maps to find our
way through the world. He discusses the nature of and differences
between these maps and the possibilities for communication
between them. From examples of finding our way in the &quot;outer
physical world&quot; he goes on to use the developed concepts to
understand the various ways patients try to cope after a heart
attack.</p>

<p>We have a book review and some notes from praxis. The
&quot;Cyber Punks&quot; - a combination of cybernetic poems and
computer graphics - are created by Erik Ullman.</p>
