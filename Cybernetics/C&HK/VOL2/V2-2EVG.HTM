Response to D.K.Johnson&acute;s Response</FONT></I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The fact that the responses get shorter may be a sign
that questions and disagreements are becoming clearer. But this will be
for the readers to judge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1.a. As an experiencing organism, I have no doubt that
I am contained in a WORLD; but that my experience is <I>&quot;of&quot;</I>
that WORLD is not something I can be sure of. The only world I <I>know</I>
is the world I am patching together from bits of experience. I am in no
position to say anything about that &quot;outer&quot; WORLD, because my
concepts and the words I use to talk about them are all derived from my
experience. Whatever is the &quot;<I>object of experience</I>&quot;, i.e.,
its cause (if there is such a thing), can obviously not be described in
terms that invariably refer to its effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1.b. The phrase &quot;all experience - viable or otherwise
- &quot; is not one a constructivist would ever use. <I>Viability</I> may
be predicated of actions, conceptual entities and operations, and thus
of concepts, words, theories and models; experience may be agreeable (when
it does not impede those constructs) or contrary when it shows them to
be non-viable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1.c. It is, indeed, a central point in constructivism
that the statement &quot;P: I am dealing with nothing but experiential
items.&quot; <I>cannot</I> be claimed to be &quot;true&quot;, because,
like everything a constructivist says about his orientation, it refers
to a <I>model</I>. And models may be viable or not, but they can never
be said to be true in the ontological sense that David has in mind. This,
of course, does not preclude that we might argue about whether <I>it is
true</I> that I or someone else uttered the sentence; but then we are arguing
about experience and not about the WORLD.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2.a. If by &quot;self-inconsistent&quot; David means <I>circular</I>,
I fully agree. I would claim that any theory of knowing that attempts to
analyse cognition by means of cognitive tools will <I>ipso facto</I> be
circular. Having seen the usefulness of admitting circularity as a positive
principle in cybernetics, I have nothing against that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2.b. The notion that the reflection upon an act of seeing
should enable the seeing subject to compare &quot;the contents&quot; of
that act of seeing (i.e. <I>what</I> was seen) with an <I>external</I>
object which, as David says, is &quot;intended&quot; by the act, raises
the original question <I>how</I> we might access that object in a way that
does not again involve experience. From my point of view, this is indeed
&quot;attempting to speak the unspeakable&quot;, for which I have great
sympathy and respect, provided it is done in the mystic's language of poetic
metaphors and not presented as rational analysis.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>From the editor</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The discussion on this central point in the second order
stance of cybernetics is open for everyone who has a constructive contribution.
The papers of Qvortrup and Brier in this issue discuss the problem from
different angles. Further these papers open for the discussion of the relation
of second order cybernetics and the semiotics of C.S. Peirce. In my opinion
an important issue in the comming years.</FONT></P>
