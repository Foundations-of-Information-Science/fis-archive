<I>Introduction to the Theme: the Theory af the Artificial</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>What is &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;or &quot;virtual
reality&quot;? What is a computer as a system of software. What is a piece
of music? Are they machines, produced by man, aimed at manipulating the
environment? Obviously, they are not. Still, however, they are artificial
objects, or they are &quot;artificialisms&quot; which is a strange term
but avoids the materialism implied by the word &quot;object&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In this century one of the most influentive books about
the artificial is H.A.Simon's book <I>The Sciences of the Artificial. </I>Simon's
premises assume the artificial as products of man's constructing activity
and starting from that point his theory produces an illuminating series
of findings. However, these premises can also be studied in themselves
and, in this way, the question becomes: is it plausible to think that,
inside the concept of 'technological object', we could find different realities
in the same way that we found different subatomic elements inside the atom?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is our aim within this thematic section: to analyze
artificialisms, i.e. to analyze the artificial <I>in se</I> and not just
as an adjective of some (more important) noun. Three major topics can be
identified:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>First, a concept cannot be defined through its correlation
with something &quot;out there&quot;, a material object; it must be defined
through its relations to other concepts. For example, the concept of &quot;the
artificial&quot; implies the existence of something non-artificial, i.e.
concepts of &quot;the natural&quot; and of &quot;the social&quot;. Even
more tricky, however, a new concept gives a new - or a modified - meaning
to old concepts. An analysis of &quot;the natural&quot;, &quot;the social&quot;
and &quot;the artificial&quot; is provided in Lars Qvortrup's article.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Second, traditionally concepts like &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;
are used as subsets of the concept &quot;technology&quot;. However, in
our opinion one must differentiate between conventional machines and artificial
devices. If we look at the concept of technological objects with a sort
of new conceptual microscope, we can easily distinguish between two quite
different classes of motivations for generating such objects: one is the
desire to <I>produce</I> machines which, adapting themselves to nature,
are useful for human needs; another is the desire to <I>reproduce </I>something
existing, usually some natural system, both accepting a challenge interesting
in itself or, again, for human needs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The 'reality' of an artificial device is very different
from the reality of a conventional machine. In fact, we build up the artificial
to surrogate, to replace, to mimic or to copy (the differences among these
verbs should be deeply studied too) something existing outside it. Therefore,
its reality is always swinging between its being a machine and its natural
reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Since the artificial cannot reach the stage of 'replication'
of the natural exemplar, what kind of reality does it establish ? Is it
possible, between natural objects and conventional machines, to introduce
something like 'naturoids' ? In any case the diversity of the artificial
from the pure 'invented' machine seems to be clear. Thus, a differentiation
within the concept &quot;technology&quot; must be provided. This is the
aim of both Lars Qvortrup's and Massimo Negrotti's article. However, where
Qvortrup uses the phrase &quot;second order technology&quot;, Negrotti
uses the phrase &quot;technology of the artificial&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Third, artificial devices are built in order to &quot;mimic&quot;
something outside the device, be it something in the natural, the psychic
or the socal world. But what does it mean to &quot;mimic&quot;? This issue
is discussed in Massimo Negrotti's article. It is plausible to think that
the concept of artificial concretely includes two poles (nature and technology)
and generates new realities and not only metaphores. A children's game,
a theatral piece, a painting or a symphony are good examples of artificial
realities in the sense that they try to reproduce situations, feelings
or ideas by means of 'technologies' like social rules, language rules,
colour rules or acoustic rules. What kind of objects do they set up ? Surely
they generate artificial realities, but not in the sense of something false:
rather they establish new levels of reality (or recombine other levels
of reality in a new one) strictly depending, as in any other case of the
artificial, on two factors: the 'selections' of the author and the technological
tools adopted to reproduce them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a sense, man is much more involved in doing the artificial
than in doing something natural and this is, perhaps, his very peculiarity
as compared to lower living systems, though not to all of them. Since <I>to
reproduce</I> is, <I>coeteris paribus</I>, more easy than to <I>produce</I>
<I>ex novo, </I>humans spend a lot of time reproducing the world, both
the external and the internal one, thanks to the various technologies invented
during the centuries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The more an artificial object is based on new or renewed
technologies (as it happens in the artistic revolutions) the more it includes
an 'added value' of complexity. For instance, while emotions are daily
communicated among human beings, they become something different when they
are reproduced by a learned and creative composer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For the same reason, the new technologies tend to be misunderstood,
or to be perceived as astonishingly 'unreal', when they introduce new models
of thinking, or of ways of acting, or of looking at either the natural
or established cultural realities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At every stage of social development a cultural shift
is needed in order to make it understandable that there isn't just <I>one</I>
reality (or, better to say, the realities we are confident about). The
reality of the artificial is the next one we have to accept, since it promises
to be very helpful also for understanding human nature.</FONT></P>
