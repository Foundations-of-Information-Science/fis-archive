<I>Major Metaphors of Communication and some Constructivist Reflections
on their Use</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>The following essay is about human communication. Traditionally, one
would define the concept, proceed to force a variety of experiences into
its terms and declare the exercise a success if it appears to capture a
great deal of territory. However, while tempting, such constructions of
reality also are rather lonely ones devoid of contributions by Others that
populate reality as well.</P>

<P>In contrast, this essay seeks first of all to listen to everyday expressions
of notions of communication. This intent is grounded in the belief that
their ordinary nature does not disqualify them when comparable scientific
conceptions are available. Indeed, most social scientific theories can
be shown to have grown out of ordinary folk wisdom. Scientific conceptions
are just more formalized and subjected to different kinds of tests then
the notions practiced in everyday life. To listen also means to have an
understanding of the language in which these everyday notions arise and
an understanding of the communication practices in which they come to be
embedded. This essay therefore also is about understanding Others' understanding
of the kind of communication practices in which we ordinarily participate.</P>

<P>In pursuit of this second-order understanding, <I>I will start the paper
with a brief theory of metaphor, one that goes beyond mere rhetorical formulations
and links language with the creation of perceived realities. Following
it will be a survey of what I consider to be the six most pervasive metaphors
of human communication in everyday life. Each turns out to entail its own
logic for human interaction and the use of each creates its own social
reality. This descriptive account is intended to provide the &quot;data&quot;
or the ground from which I shall then develop several radical constructivist
propositions. These are intended to reflect on how a social reality could
be conceived that does afford so many incompatible ways of communicating,
on the individual contributions to understanding, understanding of understanding,
and viability in practicing such metaphors, on what makes communication
a social phenomenon, on three positions knowers can assume in their known
and the theories of communication commensurate with these positions. Then
I will sketch some aspects of mass communication in these terms and comment
on its research.</I></P>

<P>Propositions of this kind should prove useful in efforts to construct
scientific communication theories or, to be less ambitious, to understand
communication as a social phenomenon that involves each of us with other
human beings. For lack of space, the concern for issues of mass communication
had to be severely curtailed, leaving the readers to continue on their
own.</P>
