<i>Information and Aesthetic</i></h3>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>Aesthetics has been defined relative to objective and
subjective values. Its historical and cultural world views are
referenced. The author's view of beauty as communication is also
introduced, where chance and necessity, the two antithetical
realities, produce the information processes of modern time. That
is, &quot;difference&quot; is associated with chance, the
irrational, the spontaneous and the individual aspect of reality
as opposed to necessity, the rational, the formal, and the
universal aspects of things. Information is introduced as, the
origin, as well as essence, of life. It is what produces
information and is the only agent which produces both matter and
psyche. Order and disorder, and the laws of &quot;opposites&quot;
are considered building blocks of identity and difference and
information. Information and Communication as an interconnecting
agent are also considered a bridge between Eastern and Western
philosophy, i.,e., in its deconstruction of the particular into a
web or field of energies in the West, and in Eastern thought in
its becoming one with Nirvana or Brahman, the Sufi or the Tao,
the ultimate one and all.</p>

<p>Because goodness and truth under the influence of reason and
science had failed, Eastern philosophy as an alternative to
Western models is recommended. It is suggested that all that is
left objectively is beauty, thus reason as basic is giving way to
rules of beauty. And its principles are capable of describing
man's evolution and his culture, as well as his aesthetic
experience, which is nothing but information processes and
communication. In conclusion, design as aesthetic communication
is introduced as a model to reflect the above principles. </p>
