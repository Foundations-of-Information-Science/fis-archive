<I>FOREWORD</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In the present issue the two first papers by Lars Qvortrup and Massimo
Negrotti constitute a special thematic section on &quot;The Theory of the
Artificial&quot; with its own introduction on the next page.</P>

<P>The third paper &quot;A Cybernetic and Semiotic view on a Galilean Theory
of Psychology&quot; written by S&oslash;ren Brier analyses the contribution
of second order cybernetics to the solution of some of the basic epistemological
problems of psycho-biological research and cognitive science. With the
work of the Danish psychologist Iven Reventlow as an example the paper
is focusing on the positions of Maturana, von Foerster and Luhmann in the
field between science and philosophy.</P>

<P>In the praxis section we bring a short personal paper by Marc Luyckx
from &quot;The Forward Studies Unit&quot; of the EEC Commission: &quot;Cultural
Change and Ethical Responsabilities of the Scientist&quot; who discusses
the basic changes in our society and its significance for our understanding
of science and its - and the scientists - role in the development of society.</P>

<P>In the last section Michael Manthey inform about ANPA - The Alternative
Natural Philosophy Association. In the next issues we will bring information
about other interdisciplinary activities in different parts of the world.</P>

<P>Finally, we bring a book review and a continuation of the discussion
between Johnson and von Glasersfeld on the epistemology and ontology of
second order cybernetics. The subject they are dealing with is also discussed
in the papers of both Qvortrup and Brier. Both of these papers open towards
a new area of discussion: The connection between second order cybernetics
and the semiotics of C.S. Peirce.</P>

<P>The journal is now expanding over the globe, and the number of consulting
editors has also expanded. A warm welcome to them and the new members of
the editorial board: Ervin Laszlo, Edgar Morin and Niklas Luhmann on board
this self-organizing system of global second order communication. A happy
new year to all subscribers and co-workers.</P>
