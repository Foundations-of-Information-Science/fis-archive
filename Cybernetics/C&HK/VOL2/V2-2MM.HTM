<I>ANPA - The Alternative Natural Philosophy &nbsp;Association</I></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The editor asked me, in my capacity as occasional reviewer,
fellow traveller, and former ANPA president, to describe this organization
for the readers of CYBERNETICS &amp; HUMAN KNOWING. I will therefore begin
by quoting from ANPA's `statement of purpose': &quot;The primary purpose
of the Association is to consider coherent models based on a minimal number
of assumptions to bring together major areas of thought and experience
within a natural philosophy alternative to prevailing scientific attitude.
The combinatorial hierarchy, as such a model, will form an initial focus
of our discussions&quot;. `Natural philosophy' being a (slightly archaic)
synonym for what we now call `science', the interest of ANPA for this journal's
readers is thus apparent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A few historical and organizational facts must take temporary
priority over an explanation of what `the combinatorial hierarchy' is.
ANPA emerged - without name or other such formalities - in the 1960's in
England as a loosely coordinated group of physicists and mathematicians
who met roughly yearly to discuss fundamental issues. The key members of
this original group were Frederick Parker-Rhodes, Ted Bastin and Clive
Kilmister, and Ted and Clive are still active. ANPA came to exist formally
in 1978 with the above statement of purpose, and in the course of the 1980's
budded an American West Coast affiliate known as ANPA West at the initiative
of H. Pierre Noyes (SLAC) and David McGoveran. The British branch, &quot;ANPA&quot;
per se, meets yearly in September in Cambridge, whereas ANPA West meets
in February at Stanford. See <B>Box 1</B> for further details.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The `combinatorial hierarchy' is a structure whose explication
is the topic of the following section. At the most general level, it is
a mathematical structure whose uniqueness and gene-rality invite multi-faceted
interpretation. Given that the founders of ANPA were mostly interested
in physics, it has traditionally attracted those interested in physical
theory. However, we have increasingly been attracting those interested
in biology, and hope this will continue. I note that semioticians should
find the hierarchy of interest.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>The combinatorial hierarchy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>An understandable mathematical characterization cum description
of the CH is difficult to fit into the present confines, so I will attempt
it mostly in words. The hardy reader can try <B>Box 2</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The combinatorial hierarchy (hereafter, `CH') is, first
and foremost, <I>combinatorial</I>: that is, it is based on the combinatorics
of arbitrary symbols, and contains in and of itself no <I>a priori</I>
interpretation of said symbols. We say `The' because it turns out that
the most general form - based on exactly <I>two</I> dichotomic symbols
- is the sole exemplar. We say `hierarchy' because it consists of a series
of `plateaus' or `levels', each of which is constructed on the basis of
the preceding level. There are two operations on symbols: <I>discrimination</I>
- denoted by `&frac12;', which compares symbols to see if they are the
same (`0') or different (`1'); and what I will call <I>aggregation</I>
- denoted by simple juxtaposition, which groups symbols together. I should
perhaps note that the arithmetic properties of `1' and `0' play no particular
role here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The first step in constructing the CH is to postulate
the existence some otherwise undifferentiated and totally structureless
universe, f. [A ton of philosophical questions is herewith ignored!]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The second step is to compare this universe with itself,
yielding f&frac12;f = 0, so we now have one symbol, `0'.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The third step generates yet another new symbol by noting
that the universe is not the same thing as `0', that is, f&frac12;0 = 1,
so now we have three symbols. Notice now that we cannot generate additional
symbols from what we have in hand, since the as yet untried discriminations,
f&frac12;1=0,1&frac12;0=1,1&frac12;1=0, yield nothing new. Thus at this
stage we have exhausted the possibilities of generating new symbols via
discrimination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The fourth step therefore invokes our other operation,
aggregation: we can simply replicate one or more of our existing symbols
to produce some new, but more complex, symbols. For example, given a `0'
and a `1' in our hand, and replicating `1' twice, we could produce `01'
and `11'; or by replicating `1' and `0' once each, we could generate `10'
and `01'.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>[As an aside, the symbol consisting only of 0's is always
implicitly present, so we consistently leave it out.]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Step five: Looking at these new symbols, we see that 01&frac12;11=10,
or using the other example, 01&frac12;10=11. So given some set of symbols,
we can generate others. There are, strictly speaking, three such sets here,
{(10)}, {(01)}, {(10), (01), (11)}, since (e.g.) 01&frac12;01=00 which
we always ignore, similarly for 10&frac12;10, and the 3-set, which as we
saw above closes on itself too. Such sets are called `discriminately closed'
sets, Dcs's. The `three' we have seen here is the `3' in level 1 of the
hierarchy shown in <B>Box 2</B>, column (b).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We have again exhausted the possibilities of discrimination
to expand the set of symbols, and so replicate and aggregate again. Notice
that initial symbols of a new level are built out of combinations of the
symbols at the current level. In particular, it turns out that the elements
of the Dcs's contain exactly the ones to aggregate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We have now seen the construction of two levels - steps
2 &amp; 3 and steps 4 &amp; 5 - and this process can continue. But how
far? One might think that one could go on indefinitely, and in one sense
one can. But in another sense, it turns out that the sequence terminates
with four levels. This termination comes about via the interplay between
the number of Dcs's available at a given level and the number of symbols
they can generate at the next level. In the language of vector spaces,
the symbols can be viewed as vectors, and the cut-off occurs when the number
of symbols available for building new vectors is insufficient to `span'
the resulting space.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus there are two intertwined sequences, one for the
number of symbols and one for the size of a `spanning set', between which
one `alternates' in the construction. The first sequence's series is (1),
3, 7, 127, 2<SUP>127</SUP> - 1 and the other is (1), 4, 16, 256, 256<SUP>2</SUP>.
The cut-off arises because 4&gt;3, 16&gt;7, 256&gt;127 but 256<SUP>2</SUP>
&lt;2<SUP>127</SUP>. [See ref. 1]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This may all seem a little abstruse, but the point is
that given some initial number of distinct symbols and operations for comparing
and combining them in all possible ways, we find</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>* There is a unique hierarchy, based on two symbols, which
has exactly four levels, and then <I>stops</I>! Starting with three or
four symbols yields fewer levels before the cut-off, and five or more never
get off the ground.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>* However, intriguingly, the CH has an ourobouros<SUP>1</SUP>
property, in that once the fourth level is reached, and at any time thereafter,
the set of symbols then available can be grouped into two sets, thus providing
a `new' definition of `1' and `0', and the organic development thus proceeds
self-similarly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>*This hierarchy has a precise mathematical characterization
(see references).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>*This same hierarchy turns up in other places - for example
I have found it in the use I put Clifford algebras [see ref. 2] to in AI,
and with the same interpretation. My aggregation operation is `can occur
simultaneously' and my discrimination operation is `exclude each other',
over computational events.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One last intriguing property of the CH, and the one which
prompted the most initial interest is the running sum of the number of
symbols: 3,3+7=10, 10+127=137,2<SUP>127</SUP>+136&raquo;1.7x10<SUP>38</SUP>,
and in particular the extent to which the last two in fact <I>are</I> more
than accidental approximations to the fine structure constant</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>
<IMG SRC="../../C&HK/vol2/Image1.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH=46>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0> and
<IMG SRC="../../C&HK/vol2/Image2.gif" HEIGHT=36 WIDTH=40></FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;, respectively</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0><SUP>2</SUP>.
It can fairly be said that the ANPA program has been driven by the pursuit
of this question. In the course of this pursuit, a non-trivial start has
been made in the reformulation of modern physical theory on a purely combinatorial
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Howsoever, the readers of the journal should I think take
two basic thoughts from this brief introduction:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>First</I>, that there exists an abstract formulation
of the space of symbols which, even before the symbols are given an interpretation,
contains a great amount of structure; and</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>Second</I>, that there exists an organization, ANPA,
devoted to both this structure and the greater task of creating a viable
alternative to contemporary scientific theory, which you are cordially
invited to consider.</FONT></P>

sequence thus counts the number of symbols that can be formed from some
given set of symbols by aggregation. The second sequence, column (d), is
related to the number of symbols from column (b) which can via discrimination
produce the remaining ones at the next level.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>More precisely, we invoke the concept of discriminate
closure on these `bit strings', and define a <I>discriminately closed subset</I>
(Dcs) as a single non-null string, or as that set of non-null strings which,
when any pair are discriminated yield another member of the set. If we
start from linearly independent strings <I>a, b, c,...</I>(ie. <I>a&frac12;b&sup1;0,
b&frac12;c&sup1;0, a&frac12;c&sup1;0, a&frac12;b&frac12;c&sup1;0,</I> ...we
can form the Dcs's <I>{a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b,a&frac12;b}, {b,c,b&frac12;c},
{a,c,a&frac12;c}, {a,b,c,a&frac12;b, b&frac12;c, a&frac12;c, a&frac12;b&frac12;c}.</I>
Starting with strings of 2 bits, we can form 2<SUP>2</SUP>-1=3 Dcs's, for
example {(10)}, {(01)}, {(10),(01),(11)}.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To preserve this information about discriminate closure,
we map these three sets by non-singular, linearly independent 2x2 matrices
which have the members of these sets as eigen vectors. Rearranged as strings
of four bits, these form a basis for 2<SUP>3</SUP>-1=7 Dcs's. Mapping these
by 4x4 matrices we get 7 strings of 16 bits which form a basis for 2<SUP>7</SUP>-1=127
Dcs's. We have now organized the information content of 137 strings into
three levels of complexity. We can repeat the process once more to obtain
2<SUP>127</SUP>-1&raquo;1.7x10<SUP>38</SUP> Dcs's composed of strings with
256 bits, but cannot go further because there are only 256 x 256 linearly
independent matrices available to map them, which is many too few. Thus
after four stages, the information-carrying capacity of our information-preserving
mapping scheme is exhausted.</FONT></P>
