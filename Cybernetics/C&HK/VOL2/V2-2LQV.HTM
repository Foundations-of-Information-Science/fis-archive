<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>In this article a second order cybernetics classification of natural,
social, technological, and semiological systems is elaborated. While natural
and social systems are autopoietical or second order cybernetic systems
in that they produce not only their own elements and relations, but also
their own conditionality, or - as Kant puts it - their own purpose, technological
and semiological systems - artificial systems - are heteropoietical or
first order cybernetic systems: they may or may not produce their elements
and relations, but they are not conditionalised themselves. Finally, higher
order artificial systems e.g. second order technological and semiological
systems or &quot;semi-autopoietical systems&quot; (examples such as artificial
intelligence and recursive pieces of music, respectively) are briefly characterised.
While internally they produce their own condition in order for example
to &quot;mimic&quot; a natural or a social system, externally they are
conditionalised by the social system: their purpose is to mimic, it is
not themselves. </P>
