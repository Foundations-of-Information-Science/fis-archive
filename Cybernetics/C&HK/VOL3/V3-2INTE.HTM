<I>Interview with Professor Niklas Luhmann, Oslo, April, 2, 1995</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Professor Luhmann, in the following I will pose a series
of questions on central concepts in your systems theory. I would like to
start with the basic idea: Why systems theory?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>You have to begin with a good distinction to elaborate
a theoretical framework. At the moment at least, the distinction system/environment
is, in my opinion, the best one to start with. It is not the only possible.
But there is so much literature about this, and so many developments within
systems theory, that, as I see it, the best way to integrate scientific
discussions is to use the distinction system/environment as a starting
difference - and not for example being/not being, or true/false which lead
to another kind of methodological approach.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why universalism?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is at least one specialty among others to have an interest
in universal theories. To be universal is not to be the only correct one,
but to claim to be able to explain everything, or to be able to comment
or describe whatever happens in the world or in the society.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why functionalism?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Functionalism in the traditional sense is another term
for comparative interest. So, you can compare in a purely quantitative
sense, finding that two is less than three and 2 million is more than 1000.
For the more qualitative aspects of scientific descriptions, functionalism
is to define a problem and to see what kind of solutions you can compare.
As I see it, modern society cannot be described starting from one principal
idea of humanity or justice or integration or consensus or reason. You
have to have a framework which can describe very different things like
religion and economy, or politics and family, with the same set of concepts,
so that you have a comparative capacity. This makes it possible to describe
the unity of modern society by the comparability of very different functional
systems. This can best be done with functional methodology.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why constructivism?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Constructivism is the consequence of some theoretical
positions which focus on operational closure. This means that a system
can only work within the system and not outside. A system can never operate
in its environment. If you have the intention of being consistent in your
approach, and if you have a universal interest, then cognition can be made
or constructed only within the system. There is no way operationally to
cross the boundary of the system. In cognitive science, this idea comes
from brain research, as the brain is an operationally closed system. So,
if we have to use our brains to make science, how can we get into the environment?
So this is not any longer the transcendental and not even the linguistic
discussion.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why operationalism?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The development of systems theory has shown an increased
interest in self-referential figures. The first discussion took place in
the fifties and the sixties and focused on self-organization. But this
term refers only to the structure, as the structure is the product of the
system and cannot be imported from the environment. With the term &quot;autopoiesis&quot;
and with biological or neuro-physiological research, there was a stronger
emphasis on the <B><I>type</I></B> of operation. The idea is that an autonomous
or operationally closed system reproduces its own operations by the network
of its own operations. This has very important consequences for all kinds
of theories, partly cognitive constructivism but also evolutionary theory,
as you cannot adapt to your environment if you cannot check what is outside.
Also the question of time becomes important. The idea of operational autonomy
or operational closure has revolutionary effects on other traditional fields
of social science.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why not rationality?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is partly the consequence of the decay of traditional
notions of rationality. Also the Weberian approach to bureaucracy as a
command/obey framework has been more or less openly criticized. In the
development of the theory of the firm, the concept of bounded rationality
arose. You have premises and you have to have a two-step reduction of complexity
- first to declare your premises and then to try to optimize if this is
possible. In this, you have to take into account the limits of information
capacity, and so on. I think that rationality needs a new definition. I
do not deny the possibility of rationality, and I do not deny the function
of the concept. But I have in mind a more Utopian, a more complex definition
of rationality based upon the idea of a re-entry of the system/environment
distinction into the system. In a sense you differentiate by throwing the
environment out, you have no contact with the environment. But then you
re-introduce or copy the difference into the system, so it is a kind of
contradiction to your starting point. This seems to give some hope of defining
a new concept of rationality.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>But the re-entry operation does not mean that the environment
enters into the system? </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>You copy the distinction, not the environment. You do
not have a kind of input mechanism, but if you are aware of the boundaries
of a system, then you have of course the idea that there must be something
on the other side of the boundaries that I cannot see, cannot touch, cannot
check with my operations. The system needs a kind of internal distinction
of inside/outside.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why the stress on distinctions and observers?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is partly due to the <B><I>Laws of Form</I></B> of
Spencer Brown - the idea that you cannot observe anything without drawing
a distinction and that the concept of observing is very broad, including
for example actions. You cannot act on something without making a distinction:
you do this and not something else, you cannot act without choosing to
do so or without defining a goal and an objective, and in that connection
you also have to talk about, for example, theory and not about politics.
So, in the <B><I>Laws of Form</I></B> of Spencer Brown, it was seen as
a necessity to construct or to create or to describe the identity of elements,
for example of numbers or of variables in algebra. Why is there 1 and 2
and 3 and 4? This is simply presupposed in normal mathematics. In Spencer
Brown's calculus you have a first injunction, &quot;draw a distinction&quot;,
which just differentiates a marked space from the unmarked space. But how
to get to a first definition or indication of something? This has to do
with the whole structure of this kind of calculus: only at the end and
only by exploding the possibilities of mathematical operations can the
observer enter the system, so that you can say that the primary distinction
<B><I>is</I></B> the observer. This kind of move from distinction to the
observer coincides with the theory of second order observation by Heinz
von Foerster as well as other approaches to developing or enlarging the
framework of traditional cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why self-reference and second-order observation?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is a way of increasing the complexity of the system.
I could give many answers to this, partly, of course, because it is the
most fascinating development in present days' systems theory, which dissolves
the old controversies between say human interest and input/output mechanism.
But for me, at the moment at least, the most important thing is that if
you have a self-referential loop within the system or if you introduce
the output of the system as an input into the system, or if you think of
a system as producing the starting point for the next operation, then you
have an unresolvable indeterminacy or a self-created uncertainty. This
poses the question, not how to control the complexity of the environment,
or how to reduce its complexity, or how to find stable identities, but
how to cope with your own product - uncertainty.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why the stress on the time aspect?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This too deals with the problems of rationality and self-reference.
If you accept the notion of self-referential systems, which produce their
own basis from which to start operations, which produce the network which
produces the operations, then there is no possibility of having a kind
of fixed point, a kind of reasonable criteria or whatever. The only resource
is actually time: that you have a memory, that you cannot change your past,
and that the future is distinct from the past. You have to make a decision,
which means that time re-enters time because within the decision framework
you have the <B><I>past</I></B> of the decision, the <B><I>information</I></B>
you have got, the <B><I>preparations</I></B>, and the <B><I>future</I></B>
of the decision, that is, the way you will handle the goals and risks of
the next decisions and so on. So the idea is that time is not only important
because you have to do something in time, now, and not yesterday and not
tomorrow. It is also important because one can reduce complexity <B><I>by
means of</I></B> temporal distinctions. Time is a way of getting resources,
of getting the framework of &quot;now we are here&quot;. As we cannot undo
the past, and cannot know the future, we have to use our un-knowledge of
the future as a resource of our present decision. So for me it is increasingly
important to see temporal differences as a resource, as a condition of
the possibility of decision-making.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why the stress on paradoxes?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I think it is a recent development, which is visible and
very different from the years of linguistic analysis and talk about postmodernity.
It goes beyond the classical distinction between <B><I>rhetorical</I></B>
paradoxes, which are just amazing phrases to open the space for further
discussion and new arguments, and <B><I>logical</I></B> paradoxes which
we somehow have to cope with, if we want to have a consistent system -
the Russell-Whitehead problem and then the G&ouml;del problem. The basic
point is that the observer is a precondition for describing, for indicating,
for acting at all. But to see the construction of elements, the construction
of something at all, the indication of an object, is itself a paradox.
The reason is that you cannot indicate at the same time the object and
what is excluded by indicating this object and not another one. There is
a kind of invisible space - the observer himself plus the observing. The
observer using the distinction cannot observe himself, because then he
has to distinguish himself from other observers. He can do it in the next
operation, but this repeats the problem.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>To have an invisible unmarked area is not the same
thing as having a paradox?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>No, you could have many paradoxes, in more concrete ways.
If you ask what is the distinction, you meet the problem of the unity of
the distinction. If we use the distinction, say jurisdiction/legislation
and ask for the unity, then we have to go to the legal system. But then
what is it? How to indicate the legal system with respect to the society?
And what is the unity of the society <B><I>and</I></B> the legal system,
and so on and so forth. There is a hidden paradox in all kinds of distinctions.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>And also a need of de-paradoxation?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I think the foundation of everything is the unfoldment
or unfolding of a solution of a paradox by any distinction which is to
some extent convincing at the moment. A paradox cannot be solved, but it
can be replaced by a distinction which is for the time being convincing.
So for example the distinction system/environment. Of course you could
ask what is the same in the system and in the environment. You could say:
well, the world is inside and outside, but if you want to use system theory
you have in a sense to ignore the world and to refrain from asking the
question: what is the world? You do not allow yourself to ask ontological
questions. That makes the world invisible or makes the observer invisible.
Therefore you always find solutions which in a certain historical situation
are more convincing than others, using distinctions such as nature and
culture or whatever is for a certain time convincing.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>How is it possible to combine the idea of observers
observing in many different ways with the idea of a familiar world?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A familiar world is always organized in terms of distinctions.
We know how to distinguish a tree. Trees and flowers are distinctions.
Cities and villages are distinctions, and so is Norway and Denmark. Familiarity
is the possibility of repeating the use of certain distinctions and to
be able to neglect the other side of a distinction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>But you can observe one phenomenon, for example to
be gay, using many different distinctions, each isolating a certain aspect.
You have one word and many distinctions? Is it the same phenomenon irrespective
of the distinction used?</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Steven Holmes talks about &quot;antonym substitution&quot;.
You can say &quot;I am interested in gays&quot; presupposing the distinction
homosexuality/heterosexuality. You may have another interest, for example
the political oppression of gays, or how to make the appearance of gays
normal and not pathological. To have one term, one object, is to have a
switching point for distinctions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At this time, the participants of the seminar returned
from their lunch break, making it impossible to continue the interview.
But just as texts and communications never stop, this interview might continue,
as a meeting between an author and a reader, in the texts of Niklas Luhmann.</FONT></P>
