<H3>FOREWORD</H3>

<P>S&oslash;ren Brier</P>

<P>The theme of this issue is constructivism: radical, &quot;trivial&quot;
or social. In his contribution <I>The view from Somewhere</I>, David Johnson
gives a philosophical realist critique of Ernst von Glasersfeld’s radical
constructivism. Von Glasersfeld gives a short answer entitled: <I>The View
from Here</I>. Beginning with this issue Johnson will edit a discussion
group on Thinknet. To subscribe send the message SUBCYBHUMKNOW to listserv@think.net
</P>

<P>John Mingers reviews von Glasersfeld new book: <I>Radical Constructivism:
a Way of Knowing and Learning</I> and contributes to the evaluation of
different kinds of constructivism. </P>

<P>The influential philosopher John Searle has produced an important book
on this topic: <I>The Construction of Social Reality</I>. Klaus von Krippendorff
critically reviews the text which is further analyzed and discussed by
Lars Qvortrup in his paper: <I>How is Society Possible? The Epistemology
of Social Constructivism</I>. Qvortrup also describes a soft version of
constructivism going beyond Searls&acute;s combination of natural realism
and social constructivism. </P>

<P>Guberman and Andrewsky explore the connection between aphasiology and
artificial intelligence in their paper: <I>From Language Pathology to Automatic
Language Processing... and Return</I> exploring the importance of context
and self-organization in the processes of recognition and understanding.
Evenlyne Andrewsky is welcomed as a new editor. </P>

<P>Michael Manthey reviews Stuart Kauffman’s book At Home in the Universe
which, through the exploration of self-organization principles, shows why
our presence here is not as unexpected as Monod thought when he wrote <I>Chance
and Necessity</I>. </P>

<P>Finally Ranulph Glanville has written a tribute to Gordon Pask, a founder
of second order cybernetics and constructivist communication theory, and
to Robin McKinnon-Wood a lifelong collaborator with Pask. Glanville traces
the history and products of their work giving new minds the chance to pick
up the torch. </P>

<P>Thanks to all that have contributed to the self-organization and development
of volume three. </P>
