<I>Constructivism and truth. A commen on John Mingers: Self-producing Systems.</I></H3>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>The book and its claims</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>John Mingers’ book presents the
main characteristics of the notion of autopoiesis and illustrates the phenomenon
in the domains of biology and sociology (law and family therapy). In addition,
he places the theory in a philosophical setting. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Chapter 2 presents a definition
of autopoiesis and sets up 6 criteria that must be fulfilled in order for
a system to be autopoietic:</FONT></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(1) It must be an entity with a
clear boundary,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(2) it must be analysable into components,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(3) and must operate in a mechanistic
way. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(4) Its modus operandi must be a
dynamic network of interacting processes of production, </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(5) contained within and producing
a boundary,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(6) that is maintained by preferential
interactions of its components. </FONT></FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Chapter 3 illustrates the implications
of this notion mainly in the domain of biology, and Chapter 4 contains
a somewhat sceptical discussion of Spencer Brown’s <I>Laws of Form</I>
and cellular automata as possible mathematical models of autopoiesis. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Chapter 5 - 7 are concerned with
cognition and places the theory in a philosophical setting, in particular
in the phenomenological tradition of Husserl and Heidegger. Mingers rejects
Maturana’s radical constructivism because of its inherent contradictions:
</FONT></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Such positions [relativist
theories] make an epistemological claim that all knowledge is relative
to the knower (or community of knowers), that is, that no theory can claim
objective truth. However, since such a theory if self-referential, it must
equally apply to itself. If this is accepted, then the theory is not consistent.
This problem is clearly exemplified in Maturana’s work. On the basis of
a study of the biology of the observer, he claims that we have no access
to independent reality and that different explanatory domains are equally
valid. He must either accept that his whole theory has no special claim
to validity or exempt his own particular theory from his stipulations,
which would be inconsistent.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>and suggests a reinterpretation
within the paradigm of critical realism. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Chapter 8 - 10 discuss attempts
to use autopoietic theory in the domain of social systems. Mingers regards
these attempts as &quot;a highly debatable possibility, no more&quot;.
Strict application of autopoiesis is rejected, whereas the more general
idea of closure seems promising:</FONT></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;I agree with Varela that applying
autopoiesis in a strict sense, to include notions of production and boundaries,
to social systems cannot be sustained, but that some more general idea
of closure may well be applicable.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(p. 152)</FONT></FONT></I></P></DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>A main problem is that although
social systems have boundaries, they do not possess a boundary consisting
of particular boundary elements, as required in condition 5-6. In addition,
social systems seem to be able to interact with each other in a more integrated
way than autopoiesis allows (the legal system is &quot;infiltrated&quot;
by extralegal norms and expectations). The alleged influence of the environment
upon the social system is also one of the main criticisms of the autopoietic
tradition within family therapy: the tradition tends to ignore social and
political factors, and to contain reasons for malfunctioning within the
family itself.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>The book is very well written and
presents a difficult subject in a clear and succinct way. Mingers has critical
remarks on the theory of autopoiesis, but carefully separates his own criticisms
from the presentation of the theory, so that the reader gets a chance to
judge for himself. After most chapters there is a conclusion that summarises
the main points and criticisms. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Mingers has pointed to two issues
which I feel are crucial, namely the inherent contradiction of radical
constructivism, and use of autopoiesis as a model of social systems. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>In the following I offer some brief
comments on the alleged self-contradiction of autopoietic theory. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Inconsistencies of self-referential
theories</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>I agree with Mingers that the inherent
inconsistencies in radical relativist positions are not acceptable. My
position is however, that instead of using the contradiction as a prima
facie reason for rejecting radical relativism, we may consider the possibility
of generalising the concept of truth so that at least certain kinds of
contradictions can be accommodated. My argument is that if we are to completely
avoid inconsistencies, we have to curtail our means of expression to such
a degree that they become dissociated from our daily life. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>I axiomatise radical relativism
by the statement that &quot;All sentences may be false&quot;, i.e. there
are no necessary truths. If we let <I>Mp = it is possible that p</I>, and
<I>Np = it is necessary that p </I>then from &quot;All sentences may be
false&quot; we can infer that &quot;Possibly a necessary sentence exists&quot;,
which — <I>depending upon the modal logic we use— </I>borders to self-contradiction:

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>My point is however that such instabilities
can be found in many other theories. For example, <I>critical philosophers
</I>of many schools claim that members of capitalist societies suffer from
false consciousness, which must mean that their assertions are false or
at least perverted. But critical philosophers are members of a capitalist
society so they must suffer from false consciousness too. So the theory
they have just asserted must be false, which again means that there must
be at least one member of a capitalist society that does not have false
consciousness.</FONT></FONT></P>

</TABLE>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>This pattern is not surprising:
if a general rule about society negates itself, the negation must assert
that there exist at least one member that is excepted from the rule.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, the problem may not reside
in autopoietic theory as such, but may be a characteristic of the class
of theories of which it is a member, namely theories that include themselves
in their domain, cf. Tarski (1944). </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>This class of theories is quite
large, encompassing sociology (since sociological theories are a part of
a society), the humanities (since humanists use language, are part of a
culture and have a history), economics (since economists are economic agents).
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>In both cases, the original thesis
changes itself, in the latter case even into its own contradiction. My
feeling is that the costs of avoiding self-modifying theories totally is
too high, since it requires us to remove all self-referential expressions
of the theories (cf. again Tarski 1944), which leaves us with a very poor
and irrelevant set of theories. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>I would recommend a more cautious
way course of action, which starts by trying to understand the nature of
the dynamics. This again necessitates a revision of our concept of truth
that can make sense of changing truth-values, as exemplified by the old
liar-paradox. </FONT></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>(p) This sentence is false.</FONT></FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Gupta and Belnap (1993) offers one
possible way of dealing with such phenomena, their main point being that
truth should be seen as a process of continual revision. This process can
have attractors, i.e. sets of states to which truth moves given sufficiently
long time. The attractor can consist of exactly one state (a fixed point)
which corresponds to a normal positivist point of view. Orderly sentences
must be either true or false, and they stay in this state. But some sentences
end in a limit-cycle attractor; the <I>liar</I> for example ends in a two-period
limit cycle, oscillating between true and false. Could the &quot;eternal
oppositions&quot; (<I>life is a state</I> (Parmenides) versus <I>life is
a flux</I> (Heraclitus), <I>life is spiritual</I> versus <I>life is material,</I>
<I>concepts are real </I>(realism) versus <I>concepts are constructions</I>
(nominalism)) be caught in similar limit-cycle?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>If we delve into the theory of non-linear
dynamic systems, we discover a wealth of possible attractors, some of which
may be useful for understanding the behaviour of self-referential theories.
We can distinguish between <I>global</I> and <I>local</I> attractors (<I>global</I>:
we will end at the same truth no matter where we start; <I>local</I>: the
kind of truth we reach depends upon our stating point). Stability is an
interesting subject too: what happens to a theory if a new piece of information
jolts the theory a little away from its current equilibrium? If it still
stays in the vicinity, we call the conversation <I>stable</I>; if it drifts
away to completely new claims it is <I>unstable</I>. And if it returns
to the self-same claims after some time then the theory is <I>asymptotically
stable. </I></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Attractors can also be <I>chaotic</I>:
although the theory stays within a finite, closed region of a property
space, each new elaboration yields a new value not encountered before.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Gupta &amp; Belnap use a traditional
set-model semantics, where predicates are represented as sets of objects.
In particular, truth has an extension T consisting of sentences-objets.
A sentence s is a member of T at iteration <I>i</I> iff <I>s</I> holds
in the model M at iteration <I>i-1</I>(Rule of Revision). Thus if snow
is a member of the class white things at iteration <I>i-1</I>, then the
sentence &quot;Snow is white&quot; is member of T at iteration <I>i</I>,
and it stays that way forever. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>However, (p) is different: if p
is outside T at iteration <I>i-1</I>, the p holds at this time. Therefore,
according to the rule of revision, p must be inside T at iteration <I>i</I>.
Since p is now inside T at iteration <I>i,</I> it does not hold at this
stage, and therefore must move outside T at iteration <I>i+1</I>, etc.
etc. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../C&HK/vol3/Image19.gif" HEIGHT=212 WIDTH=283></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Sentences thus fall into two classes,
unproblematic cases (Snow is white) which stay inside or outside T once
they have got there, and problematic cases (This sentence is false) that
keep moving in and out according to some cycle.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Translated into &quot;autopoiese&quot;,
we may see the Rule of Revision and T, the extention of the truth predicate,
as a closed system that perpetually reproduces itself. The system is perturbed
by the model which acts as environment for the system. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>In summary, although I am as uncomfortable
with the inherent contradictions of autopoietic theory as Mingers is, I
would like to understand a little more of the dynamics of self-referential
theories before passing judgement. </FONT></FONT></P>
