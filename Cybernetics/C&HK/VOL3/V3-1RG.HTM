<I>A (Cybernetic) Musing: Control 1</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>According to my copy (2nd edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass, 1961),
Norbert Wiener tells us of &quot;Cybernetics, or control and communication
in the animal and the machine&quot;. So control is central to cybernetics;
yet strangely, Wiener does not list it in his index. (Maybe it does not
appear in Wiener's index because it seemed obvious at the time).</P>

<P>I am not sure how well the notion of control is understood: is it really
so obvious as to need no examination? How do we come to need control, and
what do we need that we may have it?</P>

<P>I shall start from definition - not because I have great faith in either
defining or lexicography, but because definition provides a good starting
point.</P>

<P>My Shorter Oxford Dictionary gives:</P>

<P><B>Control (substantive) 1590<BR>
</B>1. The fact of controlling, or af checking and directing action; domination,
command, sway<BR>
2. Restraint, check (1594)<BR>
3. A method or means of restraint; a check (1752)<BR>
4. A person who acts as a check; a controller (1786)</P>

<P>These definitions are imbued with the idea of directionality: the words
domination and restraint are perhaps the mose telling, suggesting a power
that permits the issuing of orders that are unlikely to be disobeyed. Cotrol
is of one (possibly more physically powerful) thing by another, to the
(not necessarily exclusive) benefit of that other: dictators control populations;
managers companies; computers suites of machinery in automated factories;
switches heating systems. There is often a sense of amplification, of the
more powerful acting for (under the control of) the less powerful. And,
always, the controller controls with the intention of benefitting.</P>

<P>The central notion of control has been extended - as happens in any
field - so that its meaning may no longer be transparent. Thus, in second
order cybernetics, we are familiar with the circularity (bi-directionality)
of control, an understanding that may be complete anathema to the engineer
concerned with designing a computer system for a factory. (I have a friend,
an engineer turned systems scientist, who will not accept even the possivility
that the computer system controlling the machinery in the automated factory
may be seen, itself, as being controlled in turn by the machinery).</P>

<P>Since the notion of control has been extended while remaining central
to Cybernetics, it merits examination.</P>

<P>So why do we need control?</P>

<P>In the first instance, an answer implies two types of response.</P>

<P>Firstly, we need control because the &quot;world&quot; (in the form
of a particular system or Object - of which more in a future issue) is
not to be trusted.</P>

<P>This may be because the world is not describable or predictable (therefore,
not modellable) with either theoretical or experiential exactitude: either
the implication of Goedel's Theorem, that we cannot, ever, make perfect
models, or Wittgenstein's (for example) observation that just because something
has always appeared to be the case does not mean it must go on being so,
holds.</P>

<P>Or it may be because the world, itself, is taken not to be quite as
regular as we have believed the (mechanistic) classical physics of Newton
and Descartes indicates: as manifested (eg) in the indeterminacy principle,
catastrophe and chaos theories. </P>

<P>Thus, there may ve (although we cannot necessarily say this with any
great cetainty) an irregularity that results from either the world being
a less perfect place than we would believe it to be (being full of randomness,
perturbations and surprises), or from our inability to make adequate (complete,
consistent and repeatable) descriptions of this presumed-to-be-regular
world: and we have to allow for such irregularities if we are to be able
to control (yes!) our actions so that they may have an effect of the sort
we intend, so we can, in turn, gain some sort of stability and, hence,
predictability - for stability need not be limited to the static, but can
be dynamic as, for instance, with living systems<SUP>1</SUP>.</P>

<P>Secondly, our need for control is based in our intention. When we set
up a &quot;control-situation&quot; (in the classical sense) we are trying
to get something else to do what we want it to do (regardless of whether
it can function thus in itself). This highlights several salient points.</P>

<P>There is a goal: a desired state or condition for the system which determines
that it be treated as goal-oriented and which motivates its performance
and response to the situation it is in, while satisfying the controller's
intentions.</P>

<P>Notice that this goalis exterior to the controlled system itself, and
satisfies the purpose of the controlling system: the aim set by the controlling
system, which chooses it for the controlled system. The controlled system
has no part in this choice. Thus, &quot;exterior&quot; is exterior in both
the senses that it is neither within the system and nor within the system's
&quot;jurisdiction&quot;.</P>

<P>The success of the controlled system in achieving the aims of the controlling
system as indicated by the goal set<SUP>2 </SUP>is also assessed by the
controlling system (and is therefore assessed externally to the controlled
system). This is achieved through an act of comparison: the state desired
is compared to the state of being (the state achieved) and the difference
computed. This difference is aplied in a corrective manner to the controlled
system so as to achieve a change in behaviour and censequent state, with
the purpose of achieving a change such that the state of being more closely
approaches the desired state, that is, the goal. We know this process as
feedback, and it is one of the great gifts of Cybernetics (in the older
sense of a dowry).</P>

<P>So, in effect, the controlling system determines everything for and
about the controlled system as far as what we may think of as the control
interaction is concerned.</P>

<P>Thus we come to need control. And behind this need, behind the assumptions
or pre-suppositions that are involved - such as stability, state, behaviour,
goal etc - lies the second great gift of Cybernetics: error. That is, the
ability of some system or Object to behave in a manner transcending the
predicted (the regular) and deviating from (its progress towards) the aim.</P>

<P>Previous to Cybernetics, error had been taken as an unfortunate flaw,
to be excused away, and was generally assumed to be caused by an essential
failure deriving from limitations in our abilities and our tools and caused
by anomalous behaviour/inadequacy in the model/instrumental (observational)
failure/a lack of research. This is, essentially, a theological notion
that can be tied in with that of perfection being the remit of God. Turkish
(and other Islamic) carpet weavers, for instance, reflect his ethic when
they intentionally wear errors into the carpets. To aim for perfection
would be impertinent to Allah<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>

<P>Cybernetics, in contrast, accepts error as a basic fact of life: it
is not incidental to, nor an embarrassing flaw in the subject and in ourselves,
nor an indication of our unGodliness: rather, it is at the heart of the
subject, at the centre of the motivation of the subject's matter. Cybernetics
is remarkable (unique, at least until recently?) in that it not only accepts,
it welcomes error, taling error to be a desirable centre in its subject
matter rather than merely excusing it away. In effect, cybernetics claims
that error is, for whatever reason, in the &quot;nature of things&quot;,
and must be accepted as integral in our understanding.</P>

<P>And it is true that, with Wiener, we talk of control and the need for
control just because he was concerned with, amongst other things, servo
mechanisms and other forms of amplification of the controller's power in
the controlled, and also because of delay, imprecision, time and the difficulty
of calculating with infallible certainty for the future. Error, the failure
of the world to ve as we like to insist it is, the inaccuracy (and resulting
discomfort) of prediction, our inability to act correctly is central to
our experience and is central to cybernetics as it attempts to help us
create and maintain some sort of stability in our interactions. Our knowledge
is that, while things continue to proceed as we would like, they will not
continue forever: the one quasi-fact we know of our machines (including
our scientific descriptions) is that, in the end, they are not perfect:
the fail. Thus, error always lurks. Thus control (to counteract error when
it occurs) is an essential tool to help us live at one with the worlds
we make and inhabit.</P>

<P>Control is taken as central in Cybernetics. But there are many pre-suppositions
behind it, necessary for it to take its central place, some of which have
been introduced. We have considered the distinction between controller
and controlled, aim/goal/purpose/intention, feed-back, error; model and
description, stability and externality; and Goedel and Wittgenstein, Newton
and Descartes, mechanism and classical. Later, we will return to these.
But, having located control within Cybernetics, I shall, in the next issue,
look at control in contrast to governance and regulation; to control and
cause; and to what causes the controller to behave as it does. And to ask
about control AND communication.</P>

<P><B>Notes</B></P>

<P>1. Forgive me for this sort of description. It is a shorthand. I do
not believe that what I describe here is quite &quot;what is&quot;. The
world that I inhabit is, in my view, deeply rooted in my descriptions.
It does not exist apart from me and from this describing, at least in any
way. I can usefully know about or inhabit. But I cannot always extend this
full argument, or I would get nowhere. At a later date I will make this
argument. For the moment, I use the short-cut of a more conventional (more
realist) presentation, knowing it does not really represent what I wish
to say, but knowing it allows me to try to make a point relatively tersely.</P>

<P>I shall presume that this short-cut is to be taken as understood and
is acceptable under the circumstances, and I shall assume not to have to
excuse myself too often for using this convenience!</P>

<P>2. The goal does not, of course, have to be static. It can be moving.
The notion static is, anyhow, similar to that of goal in the static is
(normally) determined in reference to some external fixed point (itself
recursively static!). Or it is interal and, therefore, an aspect of a self-referrential
system. There are several such notions in cybernetics: what it means to
be static will also be examined later.</P>

<P>3. It should be remembered that Newton's great purpose was to glorify
God and show the immaculateness of His Order and the frailty of the human
except through discovering the Truth of God's own Laws. Newton was an Anglican
(Episcopalian) priest.</P>
