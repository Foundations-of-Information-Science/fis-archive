<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>If signs (rather than molecules) are taken as fundamental units for
the study of life, biology becomes a semiotic discipline. Animal bodies
in this view are swarming entities regulated through the distributed problem-solving
capacity of billions of communicating agents such as cells and tissues.
Based on this understanding, the idea of the body as bio-cyberspace is
introduced: The cyberspace to which people all over the world are now increasingly
investing their wits and efforts might be compared to the growing bodily
intelligence of our remote mammalian ancestors living a hundred million
years ago: In both cases a kind of strange attractor draw(s) the communicative
resources of the swarming entities (cells or minds) into a collective 'reality',
a virtual reality from the point of view of the individual entity. Intelligence
from this view is a virtual reality constructed by an animal body. </P>
