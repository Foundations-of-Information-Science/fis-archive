<I>Some Basic Notions in the Systems Theory of Niklas Luhmann</I></H3>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P><I>An attempt is made to present and organize some basic concepts from
the universal systems theory of Niklas Luhmann. Working in the theoretical
tradition of autopoiesis and second order cybernetics the point of departure
is not ontology but distinction and observation. The basic distinction
is the distinction between system and environment. Concentrating on social
systems the element of which are ephemeral communications Luhmann operates
with concepts as self-reference, time, and paradox in constructivist systems
science. As Luhmann considers modern society in functional subsystems such
as economy, science and politics he presents a picture of society with
no center and no important place for the individual.</I></P>

<P>The ambition of Niklas Luhmann is to construct a universal systems theory,
encomassing living, mental and social systems. As a sociologist he is,
however, mainly concerned with social systems. For a theory to be universal,
it must, in the <I>first</I> place, be able to include itself in its domain
of observation. It could not claim to describe everything if it ovserved
systems from a blind spot outside the systems observed, leaving the observer
and the apparatus of observation no only unobserved, but invisible, and
presupposing that systems just exist independent of being observed. A universal
systems theory must deelop a conceptual scheme sophisticated enough to
observe its own style of ovserving and the role of the observer. It must
be able to deal with the problems of self-reference, inviting the confusing
and petrifying demons of paradox and tautology inside. Even if the last
observer is never caught - who could catch him except another uncaught
observer? - a universal theory must consider the idea of self-reference.
<I>Secondly</I>, a universal systems theory must be able to define its
own place in society, as systems theory is not detached from the world,
but is part of the society which it observes. Science is a functional subsystem
of society (cf. Luhmann, (1990), p. 7).</P>
