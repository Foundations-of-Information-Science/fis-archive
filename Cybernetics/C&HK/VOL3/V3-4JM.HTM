<i>Review of E. von Glasersfeld's: Radical Constructivism: a Way
of Knowing and Learning</i></h3>

<p><i></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Many people, including myself, will have become
familiar with the term &quot;constructivism&quot; through the
work of second-order cyberneticians such as Heinz von Foerster
and, particularly, Humberto Maturana. In broad terms it connotes
an epistemological position which claims that, as biological
observers, we have no immediate access to the external world but
that we construct ourselves the world that we each experience.
There are, of course, many flavours of constructivism from a mild
form that points out the inevitable fact that we can only
experience the would through our own bodies and that, therefore,
our experience is always <i>our</i> experience and is never
unmediated, through to Maturana's radical version that contends
that no thing exists except as we construct it - we can say
nothing whatever about any form of external world.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Having come across von Glasersfeld's work in
connection with Maturana, and knowing that there were broad
similarities although also important disagreements, I expected
this book to be centrally concerned with the current debates
about and within constructivism and particularly Maturana's
position, and was eager to read such a book. In this I was
mistaken for Maturana is barely mentioned (briefly, on a number
of occasions), and much of the discussion is historical rather
than current. So, although not what I expected, the book turned
out to be interesting in its own right and worth reading for
anyone interested in a wider view of constructivism. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The book is best described as an extended
reflection upon von Glasersfeld's own personal view of
constructivism and how it developed. As such, much of the book is
quite personal, some of it autobiographical, and although I found
this rather self-indulgent in places it did not negate the
overall value of the book. In the rest of this review I shall
outline the various chapters, commenting when appropriate, and
then give some general criticisms and my overall evaluation.</font></p>
