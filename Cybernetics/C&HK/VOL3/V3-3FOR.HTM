<H3>FOREWORD</H3>

<P>S&oslash;ren Brier</P>

<P>This issue brings articles which analyze and discuss the epistemological
and ontological assumptions of the recent developments in systems science
and cybernetics making the shift to second order thinking. What are the
consequences of the accepting the self-organization and reflectivity of
knowing and knowledge for our understanding of reality and the concept
of truth? </P>

<P>Will McWhiney - inspired by his talk at the Einstein Meets Magritte
conference in Brussels - discusses how we create realities by the making
of boundaries and further how this process creates those realities that
are the subject for discourses of power, values and social change. </P>

<P>Asghar Minai analyses the roots of emergence. He coins the concept of
‘autopoietic communication’ to create a global model encompassing information
and communication theory, semiotics and autopoiesis. He uses the model
to describe emergence and to bridge the gap between the worlds of science
and art in a spiritual ontology. </P>

<P>Celebrating Heinz von Foerster’s 85th years birthday we bring a paper
by Carlos Sluzki originally presented at the ASC-conference: &quot;Cybernetics
and Circularity: A conference on the Seeds of Cybernetics in the Work of
Heinz von Foerster&quot;. Sluzki analyzes the &quot;The Eigen-values of
Stories&quot; in the process of transforming narratives about relationships
from a family therapist point of view. </P>

<P>Ranulph Glanville continues his ‘Cybernetic Musing’ over basic concepts
in second order cybernetics. This time he discusses the concept of communication,
confronting the differences between coding and conversation. </P>

<P>Finally Peter B&oslash;gh Andersen reviews John Mingers important book:
&quot;Self-producing Systems: Implications and Applications of Autopoiesis&quot;
and discusses the concept of truth in self-referential theories and asks:
Can the truth of a theory be periodic or governed by chaotic attractors?
</P>

<P>We welcome Roland Posner, Kjell Samuelson and John Mingers as new members
of the editorial board, and Pere Juli&aacute; and Elisabeth Davenport as
new consultant editors. </P>
