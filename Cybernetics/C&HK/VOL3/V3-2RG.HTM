<I>A (Cybernetic) Musing-Control 2</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Our traditional, even classical view of control has served
(and in certain ways continues to serve) us well. In our classical view,
control is of a controlled (thing) by a controller. Often there is an implication
that the controlled is more powerful than the controller, so that there
is amplification. Usually control is towards some goal<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
a set of conditions, possibly progressive, to be attained<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
although we probably all know some control freak for whom the goal (or
rather, the purpose) is just to control. The controller is seen, in this
understanding, as causing the controlled to behave in particular ways.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the Cybernetics of Cybernetics, we modify this understanding
of control. In effect, we ask Juvenal’s question: &quot;But who will guard
the guardians?&quot; and we expect an answer! Thus, we ask what it is that
controls the controller. For, in a model (and it is a model) that is based
on control, in which control has the position of primacy, this is not a
question that can be long left unasked: to do so would be a matter of both
inconsistency and laziness, and would show a lack of diligence and rigour<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
indicating a mammoth disregard for our subject.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The general answer is, of course, obvious. The controller
is controlled, itself, by that which the controller controls (the controlled).
Immediately, the relativity of the roles of controller and controlled become
apparent: what we have, traditionally, thought of as the controlled can
equally be seen as the controller (controlling)<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
it just depends on where we are looking from. There is terminological confusion,
but it diminishes if we remember that controller and controlled are both
roles that we (the even-present observer, but that will have to wait for
another column) ascribe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A couple of examples may help get round these <FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
er’s and <FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> ed’s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In the familiar example of the so-called &quot;thermostat&quot;,
we are used to talking of the wall switch we have in our homes as the controller.
Indeed, manufacturers sell us these things as controllers. (We also, mistakenly,
refer to the switch as the thermostat: but thermo stat is just that: thermally
static. So thermostat refers to the whole system.) Anyhow, the switch senses
the temperature of the air surrounding it, compares it to some goal and
sends a signal to the boiler (furnace) and pump that heat the stuff that
is used to heat the air, either leaving the system in the state it is in,
or turning it off (or on) to compensate for temperatures measured (by the
wall switch) as either too hot or too cold. In this case, it is clear that
the switch controlling the boiler and pump is being controlled, itself,
by the temperature of the air that is a direct product of the boiler and
the pump: ie, the switch (the controller) is controlled by the boiler and
pump (the controlled), the controller is controlled by the controlled.
To start, normally, from the switch as controller is merely a matter of
convention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Equally, in the computer controlled factory mentioned
in the last issue, the computer is of little use unless it can somehow
confirm that the controlled robots and other equipment have done the necessary;
that is, unless it can sense what is happening and adjust its behaviour
according to what it senses (and what it wants). The controller computer
is controlled by the (controlled) robots etc it supposedly controls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>As a final example, I cannot resist the story I hope is
not apocryphal of BF Skinner. Myth (or rumour) has it that before one lecture
his students banded together and determined that whenever he moved to the
right in the lecture hall they would smile, but whenever he moved to the
left they would look disinterested or frown. By the end of the lecture,
Skinner was trapped in his corner on the right of the auditorium. And (which
is not normally told) the students had frozen grimaces (smiles) on their
faces. The old controller, controlled himself by his controller audience,
had lost none of his necessary ability as controller of the students, his
controllers but also his controlleds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, control, in the Cybernetics of Cybernetics, is seen
as circular: controller and controlled are (relative) roles, each -er being
-ed to the other as its -er.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Of course, Wiener and the other founding mothers and fathers
knew that control was circular: that was the whole point of Cybernetics,
both generator and result of feedback. But they do not appear to have pushed
the (Second Order) argument towards the roles of controller and controlled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(Gordon Pask, my teacher, who Heinz von Foerster calls
&quot;Mr Cybernetics, the Cybernetician's Cybernetician&quot; used to talk
of the interactivity that this sort of circularity in control implies by
reference to kicking a chair. You kick it. It does not necessarily<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
or normally<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> kick back. But your foot may
well hurt. Thus, in the most linearly directional of actions there is the
potential for circularity of response (ie, interaction). Having hurt your
foot you may choose not to kick a chair again, intentionally, unless you
are especially thespian. And so, you are controlled.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And it is hard, once this is understood, to think of control
in any other way except when circumstances are exceptional: a crowd (even
a nation) held in thrall, bewitched, terrorised and hypnotised by a &quot;great&quot;
dictator<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> having given up its autonomy
and its acceptance of responsibility (or, more commonly (thank goodness)
and much less terrorisingly, a rock star); a powerdrill being pumped through
its full downward range. In effect these are general cases where feedback
is very, very weak, and they bear the relationship to our current understanding
of control in the Cybernetics of Cybernetics that Newton's Mechanics bears
to Einstein’s: a simplification, a special case, and still tremendously
useful. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(I once tried an experiment in the exercise of non-circular
control in a downtown multistorey car park in Seattle: could I go down
the spiral ramp, having calculated how much lock to put on my wheels, without
scraping the sides of the car and without adjusting my steering? I thought
I managed rather well<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> nearly three whole
revolutions before I had to make the adjustment that avoided me scraping
the sides of my hire car. (Note that I assumed that the spiral was regular,
virtually perfect). But the point is, I did not manage to descend the ramp
without the action of feedback, without the control becoming circular,
without the walls of the ramp and the path of the car controlling my action:
I adjusted the steering!)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>So, in the Cybernetics of Cybernetics, Juvenal's guards
will (must) guard the guards<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> themselves,
in a circle of guarding. (Or each guard must guard his/her self alone,
which is self-reference.) Otherwise, we would be faced with the buck passing
problem (the chain of linear control that has no reason to stop) that &quot;caused&quot;
Harry S Truman to state (on his desk) &quot;the buck stops here&quot;,
a phrase later somewhat downgraded in value through its use by Richard
Nixon during the Watergate d&eacute;bacle. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But I am getting a bit ahead of myself. For we still have
to consider a little more the why of control, and how it relates to cause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Why control?&quot; was examined, to some extent,
in the last issue. We discovered that there are at least two reasons we
like to exercise control. Wishing to amplify some power (in the extreme,
any power<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> that is, the power-freak’s wish
to control control control) and the essential centrality of error in our
world (which I argued was desirable). We organise control so that we can
harness some quality or power that we, in ourselves, don’t have enough
of (physical strength; precision of movement; and, from the examples given
above, heat generation; coordination of multiple inputs; and teacher control):
and we compensate for (universal) error that we find afflicting our predictions
(made through models and understandings) of the world into which we construct
ourselves (variations in outside temperature and slow response times; flaws
in materials and the breakdown of machinery). But what of cause. How does
cause enter in here?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>When we speak of control being exercised, we also talk
of cause. In a control system, the controller is considered to have caused
the behaviour of the controlled. Control and cause can, in this universe,
(always?) be used interchangeably. Thus, controllers cause behaviours;
carrying out a control action causes a particular output (behaviour); the
controlled behaves as and at the effect of the controller’s causing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If control and cause are interchangeable, is it any wonder
that Cybernetics has become the science of circular causality? Yet for
years we understood that causality could be circular (for that is what
feedback indicates) while we seem not to have understood what this intended
for control. Even though control is present in Wiener's definition (neither
cause nor feedback are), we seem not to have looked (explicitly) at control
as circular, although I guess we understood it intuitively and that is
how we came to accept circular causality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Of course, this amalgamation of control and cause (causality)
has considerable implications, which we will look at on another occasion.
For we might want to try applying the understandings we have applied in
each to the other, a sort of vast logical extension, amongst other things:
and our understanding may then be enriched, more powerful and, possibly,
more far-reaching and revolutionary. Control without the controller? Cause
without the causative agent? Revolution without the revolutionary? Surely
not. But that is, of course, the heart of the Cybernetics of Cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>With cause goes blame, if we want it. And we often do.
Blame is our way of addressing cause: you caused this (to happen to me),
you are to blame (I am not responsible). In the last World War, the excuse
was often given that we were not responsible for our actions, we were controlled.
I do not mean a moral lecture: I believe I would have behaved no differently,
I am afraid to say. I mean to show the connection between control and cause,
and between cause and blame (and between blame and responsibility). We
live in a world that runs on blame. We have a legal system making fortunes
out of attributing blame, even when it is quite inappropriate (uttering
&quot;accident&quot; is to say that there is no blame). Truman’s assertion
(and Nixon’s blind) attest to the dominance of blame and to the directionality
of cause, in our constructions. Yet cause (control) and hence blame are
circular, as we have seen (and as many a therapist will tell us), which
might cause us to revise our approach. It would be to our benefit to do
so: our (mental) health, our peace (of mind). And the way this happens
is in adopting circularity, which means responsibility. I am responsible
for what I am responsible for (and the accident is responsible for being
an accident). We need to get rid of our simplified notions and enter the
richness of circularity! The buck’s stopping is a way of doing this: where
the buck stops, there is<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> if there is control,
cause, blame<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT> circularity in the stopping.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I once needed to explain to a group of spouses of Cyberneticians
what the difference was between Control Theory, and First and Second Order
Cybernetics (the Cybernetics of Cybernetics). The best I could do was to
offer the following defensible (but still refutable) metaphor. In Control
Theory, you turn on the switch and insist the light has gone on regardless;
in First Order Cybernetics, you turn on the switch, and, if the light has
not gone on, you replace the light bulb; in Second Order Cybernetics (the
Cybernetics of Cybernetics) you turn on the switch and, when the light
doesn’t go on, you think of something interesting to do in the dark (you
redesign your response). For me this metaphor does at least get near to
explaining the meaning of control and the value of the three approaches.
I choose the third, the Cybernetics of Cybernetics, as mine: but then,
I have worked all my life with design. But I am aware that this third option,
unless operated within with rigour and determination, can lead<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
as does so much Second Order Cybernetics<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
to the development of a talking-shop and to solipsistic and quasi-autistic
wishful thinking, claiming that anything goes and so doing nothing much.
It can be an easy way out: but it should be the hardest and most demanding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There is much still to be excavated here, but I will leave
it. I did not discuss the difference between governing, controlling and
regulating‹and perhaps we will come back to these in due course. The difference
is, anyhow, modal (although Watt’s governor is a very nice example of a
self-regulating system, giving us a way into that discussion). Control,
cause and blame may also merit further reflection. Nor I have really introduced
communication: I will do that for the next issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But I should like to end with a truly Cybernetic understanding
concerning this circularity of control. Ross Ashby argued that every controller
of a system (a controlled) must have at least as much variety as the controlled
(system). Otherwise, it (the controller) must necessarily limit the behaviour
of the controlled. In a wonderful paper (1972), Mike Robinson demonstrated
how this happens in classrooms (&quot;Classroom Control<FONT FACE="MS LineDraw">-</FONT>
some Cybernetic Comments on the Possible and the Impossible&quot;, Instructional
Science vol. 8). But the point that must be taken from the discussion in
this column is that the variety in both controller and controlled must
be exactly the same, for each is the controller to the other's controlled
(and each is the controlled to the other’s controller). For system designers,
this means great care must be taken, a care we did not previously realise
we had to take, to match variety exactly. The variety of the controller
and the controlled must, for effective control to take place, be the same.</FONT></P>
