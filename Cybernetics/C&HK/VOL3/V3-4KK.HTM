<I>Review of J.R. Searle's: The Construction of Social Reality</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Social scientists know John R. Searle largely for his
speech act theory. Following Wittgenstein’s fundamental insight that words
do not picture anything and J. L. Austin’s subsequent work on what words
do, Searle managed to define an exhaustive set of five speech acts. These
were to become the backbone of much research into interpersonal communication.
Searle achieved this feat by reducing human communication to individual
actions, leaving out the people who engaged such actions as well as the
dialogical processes by which speech acquires the meanings Searle theorized.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In his latest book, one could say, he did it again - but
this time to a far more complex area of human being: <I>social reality</I>.
Like a magician, Searle makes things appear simply by abstracting a few
elements from the complex fabric of social life and presenting a logical
and hence partial analysis of these. His book is well written, avoids technical
jargon, and gives plausible examples. Regrettably, it ends with a defense
of Searle’s branch of realism, dismissing his opponents with a few simple
arguments, as if his construction of social reality was a mere side product
en route to this defense. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Let me walk you through some of Searle’s carefully developed
distinctions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Chapter One presents what he calls <I>building blocks</I>.
Architectural metaphors are appropriate for Searle as he builds logical
concepts upon logical concepts - ultimately on a realist foundations. From
an analysis of what typically happens in a restaurant, Searle concludes
that social reality is<I> weightless</I> and <I>invisible</I> and not reducible
to physics (although visible facts undoubtedly are involved). To Searle,
social reality is also <I>observer-relative,</I> that is, it cannot exist
without human participation. His counter example is Mt. Everest whose existence,
he claims, does in no way depend on the existence of humans. Most consequential
is Searle’s claim that social reality <I>serves assigned functions.</I>
The function of a screw driver, he argues, is not intrinsic to its materiality,
but assigned by someone. To capture this idea, and on his preferred level
of generality, he provides us with the formula &quot;<I>X counts as Y in
the context of C</I>&quot; and frames most of his conceptualizations in
these terms. Accordingly, not only does that flat-ended stem with a handle
count as a screw driver in the context of screws in need of fastening or
loosening, but so does Bill Clinton count as US President in such context
as signing a bill into law or giving a State of the Union address. Moreover,
objects can become representations by virtue of being assigned the function
of standing for something other than themselves. This formula seems to
do it all! </FONT></P>
