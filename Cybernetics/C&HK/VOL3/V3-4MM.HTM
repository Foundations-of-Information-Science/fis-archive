<I>A review of Stuart Kauffman's &quot;At home in the Universe&quot;</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The author's goal in this book [1] is to convince the
reader that the widely held opinion that life on earth (or anywhere else)
is the product of a whole string of incredibly improbable chemical (and
higher level) events is incredibly wrong. Being a professional biologist,
Kauffman writes with authority, and is explicitly aware that he is preaching
against the mainstream. For example, Ernst Mayr, the ‘grand old man’ of
American biology, writes in a recent book [2] &quot;... each step leading
to the evolution of intelligent life on earth was highly improbable and
[...] the evolution of the human species was the result of a sequence of
thousands of these highly improbable steps. It is a miracle that man ever
happened, and it would be an even greater miracle if such a sequence of
improbabilities had been repeated anywhere else&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>However, rather than wage a war of words, Kauffman presents
the thought-provoking results of a series of ‘Monte-Carlo’ - like experiments
(i.e. computer simulations). The first of these goes like this: Imagine
that you have ten thousand buttons spread around on the floor. Begin now
to pick up two buttons at random and tie them together loosely with a piece
of thread. At first, every button you pick up will be ‘unthreaded’, but
after a while (i.e. when 50% of the buttons have been threaded), every
time you pick two buttons up, you in fact pick up several. In very short
time, all the buttons are suddenly connected together in one large mat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The interpretation to be placed on this example is that
the individual threadings of button (-clump) pairs represent (reversible)
chemical interactions between the two entities. Kauffman's point is that
even quite random and low-probability interactions must &quot;inevitably&quot;
and with surprisingly high probability play together to form &quot;systems&quot;
when certain very general prerequisites are met. Of course, the button
example alone cannot bear this argument, but it is typical of the kinds
of experiments (i.e. computer simulations) that Kauffman and his students
and colleagues have carried out over the years, and which he describes
in reasonable detail. The result of all of his considerations - there are
many angles, and I learned a lot - is that, even given one-in-a-trillion
probabilities of interaction, only a few hundred distinct reactants will
inevitably form a stable and evolutionarily likely entity. From this follows
the conclusion that life is not at all incredibly unlikely, but, rather,
&quot;expected&quot;: we are &quot;At Home in the Universe&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>From about the 60% mark, Kauffman begins increasingly
to apply his results to other than biological systems - economies, technological
development - building on the fact that his experiments never specify what
the interacting entities actually are. This part of the book is also concerned
more with the connection to chaos theory and the additional point that
&quot;systems&quot; must ‘live’ somewhere between true chaos and stultifying
stasis, a point of view endemic at the Santa Fe Institute, with which Kauffman
is closely associated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Of complaints I have two: the first several (crucial)
examples are explained both via a figure and via text. Unfortunately, the
two versions don't use the same terminology, and are in several cases actually
slightly different. It's as though the figures were first, but then remained
un-updated as the text evolved. This is very frustrating when one is really
trying to understand what the author is trying to communicate. My other
complaint is that, while Kauffman's arguments are fine and the systems
get built up (etc.), there is no attempt to get at the structure of the
structures, that is, their hierarchical component: one indirect reference
to Eigen and Schuster's work, for example, is too little, in my opinion,
when one wishes to cast one's net so broadly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>All in all, I found Kauffman's argument generally convincing,
and hope that the biological community will give it a fair hearing. Readers
of this journal will presumably find it of great interest, whichever side
of the various dichotomies they happen to inhabit. This is one of those
books that may well become a classic.</FONT></P>
