<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>A Personal Foreword</FONT></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>It is in the nature of conversation, indeed, it is
(at a certain level) its purpose, that the unexpected happens and interrupts
the normal and conventional flow. I had meant to write of conversation
(in the sense of the great cybernetician Gordon Pask's seminal contribution
to the field of Computer Aided Learning, &quot;Conversation Theory&quot;)
in this issue, as I had promised. But that old master of intervention,
that old conversational deformer, that old conversation theorist Pask,
himself, has interrupted my genteel progress.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>Gordon Pask died at 9.00pm on Friday March 29th 1996,
in the London Clinic. It was a relief, and it was a release, for he had
been in pain and distress. But the actuality of his death, expected for
a long time, was, nevertheless, a dreadful shock.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>At the European Meeting for Cybernetics and Systems
Research Conference in Vienna, April 1996, I was due to present a paper
(NOAH: the Ark of Knowing in a Learning Environment) that was written by
Gordon's long-time partner, Robin (Bobby) McKinnon-Wood and myself. It
was an account of a new version (&quot;NOAH&quot;) we had made of Pask's
&quot;ThoughtSticker&quot;듮he organisational &quot;engine&quot; of his
computations for constructing learning environments등hich took into account
developments in programming techniques and styles, and a string of improvements
and criticisms of ThoughtSticker and Conversation Theory which I had made
over the years. Bobby and I worked on this project during Bobby's long
struggle with death, and it was completed to the point that we could show
the idea was viable just before he finally died last September. It was
ironic, very pointed and poignant that, presenting a paper coauthored by
one dead man, the other man who inspired it should also now suddenly be
dead. The paper became a whole circle of tributes.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>I decided to present the paper by talking about these
two men, and their lifelong interaction in and through conversation. These
were two giants amongst the mediocre. There is much to write about each
of them as people, teachers, leaders, inventors, professionals, family
men-but not here and not now. My story should not be taken as absolute
historical truth (I simplify and dramatise in order to make points that
I believe transcend pure chronology): it is not quotable as that sort of
fact. But it is a true interpretation and it tells a story. I was lucky
to know them, to be their student, to work and to play with them and be
allowed to be an equal, to benefit from serious and equal discussion and
mutual criticism of our ideas, and to have them as more than friends듪ne
was like the elder brother I never had, the other like a father to replace
mine, who died when I was very young. </FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Robin McKinnon-Wood and Gordon Pask: a Lifelong Conversation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Just before 1950, two young men went up to Cambridge.
Both had unusual backgrounds. One, the retiring one who was to become the
boffin, had travelled the world with his family. He learned to speak in
Switzerland, so that although his family was British, his first languages
were French and German (and he never lost his French &quot;r&quot;). His
teenage years were spent in Minneapolis where his father had been posted
by the world bank. As a Cambridge physics scholar, he eventually came to
inhabit Isaac Newton's old rooms in Trinity College. The other had had
a lonely childhood. He was 20 years younger than his nearest sibling, a
sickly child not expected to live. He spent much of his early years alone,
ill in bed. His playmates were the companions of his mind, the fairies
for whom throughout his life he left eight small piles of food on the rim
of his plate. His education was as obviously strange and he had already
studied mining at the local technical college before going up. Originally
reading medicine, he was barred from the anatomy labs for impatiently cutting
through a cadaver's limb with a fire axe, thus shattering the glass dissection
table on which it lay. He was the dramatic one, destined to become the
prof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Somehow they met. The boffin was already, at this time,
building computers (this before Alan Turing, father of the programmable
computer, and builder of the world's first, committed suicide with a poisoned
apple). A mutual taste was discovered for nightlife and the theatrical.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And they set to work on two extraordinary special purpose
computers. The programs of these computers were truly astonishing, and
it is amazing that neither their significance nor their authorship is currently
widely recognised.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The first was called MusiColour. This was a machine that
controlled lights so that they reacted to (live) music. But not like the
trivial machines of today, which pulse with the beat and change colour
with frequency. MusiColour (which erratically toured nightclubs and popular
music venues) picked out patterns in the music, responded to these, and
got bored. If the musicians did not provide enough variety, MusiColour
would provide speculative change of its own accord, working itself up into
a frenzy until the musicians changed how they were playing. This is truly
interactive. And it is the first program that is an agent provocateur:
its purpose is to interfere with the musicians. This computer, sadly long
since dismantled, expects you to respond to it in interaction. It anticipates
drama.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The second came to be known by the generic name &quot;SAKI&quot;.
SAKI stands for Self-Adaptive Keyboard Instructor, and covers a range of
programs, of which the first was intended to aid the training of Hollerith
punch card operators. Anyone who has learned to type using a computer program
such as &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot; will have used one of SAKI's
descendents. The program measured the accuracy of performance of the punch
card operator, in terms of accuracy (both of individual keystroke and of
sequence) and speed (including rhythm) in carrying out the exercises it
set, and it adjusted the exercise tasks to increase the operator's practise
on (ie correction of) errors. Thus, the program adjusted to the performance
of the punch card operator of its own accord, the first program to self-adapt,
responding to you in the drama of interaction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>These two programs were quite revolutionary and remarkable,
and are still serviceable today. Their central concern was the genuine
interaction between the human user and the machine (in contrast to so much
of today's so-called interactive material, which is merely push-button
reactive: interaction as sales pitch rather than as meaningful).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We will leave the two undergraduates there, making their
early interactive computers and founding their company &quot;System Research&quot;,
and move on about twenty years. During this time, they have remained in
partnership, working together on occasional projects, but they also worked
quite separately: the boffin, for instance, at Margaret Masterman's Language
Research Laboratory in Cambridge, and the professor belatedly writing his
PhD and actually becoming a &quot;real&quot; professor at Brunel University,
just outside London, with actual students (including me).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The prof was now putting together what we would currently
call a special purpose learning environment, CASTE (Course Assembly System
and Tutorial Environment). This project, at the centre of a vast research
enterprise funded by the UK's Social Science Research Council, derived
initially from observations made during an analysis intended to assist
the improvement of execution of a set of very complexly interlinked tasks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And the boffin re-appeared, to collaborate. What they
put together was a machine, a theory and a practice. The machine (product
of the boffin) was an extraordinary special purpose (and very noisy) computer.
Its contemporaries were, roughly, the early PDP mini-computers. This machine,
however, was built on the cheap of ex-World War II relays. What it드nd
its successors듞omputed was relationships between topics of study (ie,
things that we might want to learn) within a large heterarchy of such topics
representing a field of study, and also the state of a learner's relationship
with the topics (eg, had they been mastered, were they being studied).
It looked like a strange and whimsical object from the Festival of Britain
(which, in some respects, is exactly what it was).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The theory was Conversation Theory. Conversation Theory
is a relativist, constructivist theory. It derives from teaching and learning:
learning is the quintessentially constructivist activity. In even the lowest
level of Computer Aided Learning, where the student can choose from many
different alternative routes and thus compose, in effect, his own (view
of the) subject, one important question is what has been learned. (That
this is now recognised as an ever critical question is due, no doubt, in
part to the development of CAL.) The matter of testing what is known is
always hard, and it is harder still with a machine. One technique is called
&quot;Teach Back&quot;. In Teach Back the student tells the teacher, in
his own words, what he believes (eg) a topic to be듣ow he understands it.
(In CASTE this was done through a special device known as the Modelling
Facility, as well as in interview.) Teach Back is interactive and conversational,
and, when extended from simply testing what has been learned about some
pre-defined topic, becomes an immensely powerful technique. In this view,
conversation, its generalisation and abstraction, both as colloquially
used and as a technical term in Conversation Theory, is a potential generator
of novelty and of understandings (hence of worlds): and of communion. It
is both medium and substance of drama. Conversation is an equivalent, an
alternative statement (of the process) of design. It permits communication
without coding and leaves meaning where I maintain it should be, with the
communicators and not in their messages. Conversation is the basis. It
is very powerful and it is very revolutionary. Rather like its author,
the prof.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The practice was all that became associated with this
theory. It included such matters as the consideration of learning styles
and of their match and mismatch; how to define and represent what is learnable
(and hence knowable); the structure required of topics so that they can
be learned (they must be productive: any learnable topic must derive from
at least two other topics (constituting its derivation or entailment),
and the topics that form such a derivation must each be circularly derivable
from the others; all topics in a subject matter must cohere to make a vast
interconnected &quot;cloud&quot; of their mutual entailment; the learner
must be able to begin anywhere (depending on his unique prior knowledge)
and see how that allows the subject to unfold the topics to be learned;
how to add new topics; etc); consequences in terms of performance of learners;
the role and formalisation of explanation; and the connection between the
topic as derived and the topic in its own right; etc. A vast body of elaboration
of the theory into the practical (generally presented under the name &quot;ThoughtSticker&quot;)
in which the prof and the boffin were more than assisted (as they also
were in the construction of both the machine and the theory) by their many
co-workers at System Research and amongst the prof's students. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The body of what is collectively referred to as Conversation
Theory is an astonishing achievement of imagination, nerve, rigour, ingenuity
and adumbration (to use one of the prof's favourite words). It is, in many
parts and particulars very hard to understand, because of a tendency to
present it all, all the time, in its full complexity: which adds to the
inherent difficulties of subtle and unfamiliar concepts (although they
appear much less strange nowadays). It has not yet won the understanding
it merits except amongst the cognescenti, in part because of these difficulties.
But it is vastly imaginative, and has far more to offer in a far richer
vein than so much of what is currently facilely trotted out. I hope that
it will become better known, because it deserves to be and because it is
so full of powerful and helpful insight and understanding of the drama
of being human in communication. It is at least as amazing and astounding
as were MusiColour and SAKI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And now the two moved into more separate streams again.
The prof took up residence in Montreal at Concordia University, and Old
Dominion University at Norfolk, Virginia, USA. He becomes part of a team
funded by the Dutch Government researching &quot;Support, Survival and
Culture&quot;, a professor at the University of Amsterdam. And he finds
his last academic spiritual home at the Architectural Association School
(AA) in London. The boffin hid himself away, as he was wont to do, until
the prof brought him into the AA, where he introduced computing to the
school (teaching me, too, so I could be his teaching colleague) and where
they examined team decision systems드 natural extension of Conversation
Theory, when you think of it. And he studied navigation: putting into practice
the art of getting from A to B, which is just what a learner does in CASTE
and ThoughtSticker. The boffin, always concerned with the practical, wanted
to know how you got through a mesh, not what its special qualities were:
all his life he was interested in &quot;navigation&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>During this phase, the prof was preoccupied with two matters.
Both are rather more difficult than Conversation Theory, and I am not,
myself, sure how resolved either is. I did, however, ask him about them
a month before he died, and he was happy to agree what I describe here
as being not completely wide of the mark.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The first grew directly out of Conversation Theory. It
was always called L<SUB>p</SUB>: L sub-p: the proto Language (or proto
Logic) for Conversation Theory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>L<SUB>p</SUB> is an attempt to construct a generative
system for Conversation Theory. The need for it becomes clear when new
topics are added to some collection (due to new discoveries or the addition
of further authoring subject-matter experts, etc) which need to be fully
linked into the richly connected mesh of entailments (a problem that arose
in the work referred to in the program &quot;EXTEND&quot;). Adding a new
topic is, of course, the way that a collection may be begun, although that
was not always apparent. L<SUB>p</SUB> is very complicated and recondite.
I am not sure who (other than Pask) has understood its innermost subtleties.
I do not claim to have. I suspect that its necessity is largely a product
of the ideas in Conversation Theory being ahead of the conceptualisations
of the instant of its invention, and that what it deals with may be done
in another way, given the conceptual and technical developments (in computing,
especially in the development of object oriented programming) of the last
twenty years. But, equally, it might just be that I am not up to seeing
the grand vision and the true significance of the undertaking등hat is uniquely
different about it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Much the same might be argued for the Interaction of Actors
Theory, which describes the space and the time within which conversation
may happen. Later in his life, the prof became more concerned with what
happened in the unending continuity that is interrupted so that a particular
conversation may occur. His vocabulary includes such words as &quot;immortality&quot;.
The Interaction of Actors Theory is an attempt to describe the endless
flux (the process of life) within which conversations can begin and end
(as they all do) and how they can do so: the eternity of a conversational
universe, in which each of us always acts and interacts and is always acting
and interacting, bringing about the conversations of our experience and
communication, and thus verifying that we are in communion, are in the
drama of being alive. (For the prof, dramatic interaction was the basis
of the experience of living). The availability of machines simply made
this both easier to imagine and easier to do: we might become &quot;immortal&quot;
through sharing with the (timeless) machine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>(The prof tried to bring all of these theories together
in his final paper, &quot;Heinz von Foerster's Self-Organisation, the Progenitor
of Conversation and Interaction Theories&quot;, which will be published
in Systems Research, volume 13 number 3드 Festschrift for his old friend
and mentor, Heinz von Foerster.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In all this remarkable work there are two themes: interaction,
and drama. Interaction as in conversation. Drama as in conversation. MusiColour
and SAKI are both involved in a conversation with the user. CASTE, ThoughtSticker,
and EXTEND, set up conversational domains and Conversation Theory is just
that. The other work contemporary with and complementary to Conversation
Theory concerned engendering and measuring conversations. L<SUB>p</SUB>
and Interaction of Actors Theory define condiions in which conversations
may start and stop. And so on. For this is a lifelong conversation, as
is life itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Which is why I have told this story as I have.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Finale</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Sometimes people ask me about the world that the boffin
and the prof made. What is it like? they ask. I have tried giving various
images, and the one I have come to prefer is this: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Imagine you go out at night in the depths of the countryside.
There is a clear dark sky, no light spillage from civilization. It is a
cold, damp night, and as your eyes become accustomed to the darkness you
gradually see little points of light듮he stars. These points of light shimmer
(because of the dampness and the coldness in the air). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If you listen carefully, you can imagine them singing
to eachother, forming into little choirs that sing together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>You, of course, are another of these stars, and you also
sing. As you move, the other stars come into focus and form constellations:
there are clusters that cohere for the moment, and that then dissolve as
you move on. The songs continue, you hear the choirs of the constellations.
The feeling is of overwhelming joy, beauty, wonder, oneness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>That is my picture of the world they made.</FONT></P>
