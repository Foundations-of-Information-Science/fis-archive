<I>A (Cybernetic) Musing: Communication 1</I></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Introduction: Considering Communication<SUP>1</SUP></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I should like, in this issue, to consider communication,
the second element in Wiener's definition of Cybernetics (although I prefer
the term characterisation: definition is trying to be too objective, too
prescriptive). I shall consider this from the point of view of a cybernetician,
NOT a semiotician (which I do not pretend to be). Semioticians might like
to develop or censor this approach through their own expertise. I shall
be interested to hear, and to enter into debate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There is a sense in which control without communication
is impossible. In the conventional view, somehow the indicators - the messages
- of the actual and desired states of a system must be transmitted and
received within that system, so that the controller (as classically determined)
can compare the actual with the desired, determine any difference and what
to do about that difference, and return messages in the opposite direction
so that the behaviour of the controlled system may be modified to suit
the wishes of the controller. When this is the view taken, communication
can't be very interesting (except in the technology of encryption) as we
shall see: the messages should just be passed along accurately; for that
is the sole function of this form of communication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is essentially the flavour of Shannon/Weaver's notion
of communication<SUP>2</SUP>: the notion of communication as the transmission
of a message, transferred unaltered<SUP>3</SUP> from one actor-location
(the clearly defined sender) to another (the clearly defined receiver)
through a channel of communication via a pair of transceivers at each end
of a channel, by means of some unambiguous and determined encodement. This
is the condition that I used to refer to when I insisted that communication,
being a sine qua non for control, really was of very little interest (and
which gave me a permission not to think about it). Of course that simplification
was wrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Why was it wrong? Because what is interesting in communication
is precisely what happens when we consider communication in other ways.
When we think of communication not as simply the direct and unambiguous
transmission of control acts and intentions, but as adding or facilitating
more than this. When communication becomes able to be other than just coding.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Coding and Communication</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Before considering alternatives to communication-by-coding,
we should ask what we get from the coding notion of communication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Of course, to a large extent what we get is what we were
looking for in the first place. That is: no ambiguity, simple encodement,
point to point transmission, clear sender-receiver roles and consequent
action. Thus, we have the possibility of command: we are able to assume
to control by the issuing of commands or orders precisely because there
is no ambiguity (and because we assume that messages are acted upon correctly
upon their decoded receipt). We can indeed send messages and expect them
to be understood (there is no ambiguity) and to be acted on in the correct
manner: the word entirely predicates the action.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This model is ideally suited to those situations in which
control/command/predictability is seen as central, in which human and other
agents are required not to think, not to interpret, not to understand,
but simply to execute. That is, in a world without meaning(s), a world
in which we deny those characteristics we (generally) most value as the
most human!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Such worlds are quite familiar. We live in automation
and with the amazing results that have come from the application of control
principles. But we also let this approach dominate in the everyday human
world. The clearest example is the military, where orders are passed and
obeyed, and where any questioning is done at great prejudice to the questioner's
career! Indeed, at one level, the whole of a military training is designed
to remove individuality and humanness so that the soldier becomes a cog
in the fighting machine. If you don't do as commanded, you are treated
as an idiot/criminal. Recently, it seems, other human institutions, including,
even, some of our Universities, have begun to subscribe to the same model,
which is, of course, astonishingly contrary!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are many other examples, usually where we require
that what we do is completely without ambiguity because, in our model,
we find situations in which we believe we cannot trust ourselves, or because
we believe there is a direct cause-effect relationship outside our human
agency<SUP>4</SUP>. For instance, in traffic management and flight control
(where we act in a speed-frame that is well outside our normal perceptual
and unaided/self-generated range), and in machine to machine communication
(again involving us working to limits that we, unaided and unamplified,
cannot manage). We spend a lot of time and effort, under these circumstances,
in drilling a uniformity of understanding and action into our operators,
and refining a lack of ambiguity into our messages (i.e., in command).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is clear, too, that many of our legislators frequently
act as if they believe that the world is of this nature (&quot;objective&quot;),
which is peculiar, since the Law, as we have evolved it, is clearly not
a set of unambiguous instructions - that is why we require judges to give
us interpretations and refer to precedent, hierarchy of intention etc.
And how often do we hear politicians insist &quot;I have made it perfectly
clear...&quot;, which can only be the case if we communicate through code
rather than language. I.e. when we n&auml;ively consider that language
is entirely lexicographical, that words have proper (and attached) meanings
- rather than that we give meanings to the utterances we perceive others
to have made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is the world that Nicholas Rescher discusses in his
(very powerful) &quot;Logic of Commands&quot;, where he sets out the conditions
in which commands may be issued and enacted. What is interesting about
this is that Gordon Pask demonstrated that you need only vary one of Rescher's
conditions (the predication that what is commanded will be executed) to
convert the Logic of Commands into a Logic of Questions (where the predication
is, at its strongest, that what would have been in Rescher's case the command,
just might be carried out: that is, where it is accepted that there is
doubt as to the outcome). Thus, Pask showed us that it does not take much
of a relaxation in the conditions of our descriptions to open up a world
of much greater interest and variety than the literal one-to-one world
of command, i.e., a world of question! Opening it up means that we are
no longer looking for the a deterministic outcome from an act of communication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Coding-as-communication gives us a picture of a mechanical
world. It may be complex, a wondrous clock-like mechanism, but it is mechanistic
nonetheless. And it is a world that obeys: where control intentions are,
in principle, translated without flaw into control actions (except when
there is noise) just as we expect in our scientific/mechanistic view of
the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is a world in which communication is transparent,
merely carrying the unambiguous message exactly and correctly. Its role
is secondary, and I don't find it very interesting. It serves the purposes
of control, and may be forgotten, to almost all extents and purposes. Here,
communication is the means for the exercise of control, yet is (virtually,
and from the point of view of the controller) without quality in itself.
What qualities it has are the domain of the specialist and only appear
when there is some sort of silly inadequacy (e.g. the channel capacity
is too small). It never gives us room for novelty, for the development
of ideas, for involvement and passion. It never objects, it is not a medium,
but a sort of super-ether. And it denies meaning: for meaning, like observation,
belongs in and to us. Just as Heinz von Foerster has pointed out that objectivity
is the pretence that there can be observations without an observer, coding
is the pretence that meanings can be communicated without &quot;mean-ers&quot;
to construct the meanings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Even so, the control model of communication gives the
agents that own the lines of communication great power. They (may) appear
neutral, but their ability to pass the instructions means that they determine
which control messages will be transmitted. They have the ultimate form
of censorship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>And it also presumes that everything that is worth encoding
may be encoded: that is, that what is to be said is intended as a control
action and that all such control actions can be encoded (rather as a Turing
machine can compute all that is computable). The notion is tautological
in spirit, and it misses a vast area in which we know (from our experience)
that we do communicate. The area of those things that cannot be encoded,
because they cannot be said (of their own nature), or they are imprecise,
or they appear in and through the acts of communication (between individuals)
themselves rather than existing ready to be encoded. Or when the communication
channel adds something of its own (is not transparent). Or whatever else.
(Thus, this presumption is also a form of censorship).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It is at this point - the point where communication is
seen as possible without the unambiguous and encoded transmission of messages
- that communication becomes interesting: and it is here, too, that second
order cybernetics occurs, and where one of its &quot;fundamental&quot;
models, Gordon Pask's &quot;Conversation Theory&quot;, arises.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For we can ask, what about communication that is not intended
primarily to facilitate control? What about communication about communication,
communication for its own sake, communication in which it is not assumed
that we pass messages unambiguously and with certain decoding to those
who are to receive? What about communication as we so often experience
it, as our normal experiencing?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Meaning as Conversation and Communication</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The crucial concept behind Wiener's and Shannon/Weaver's
original cybernetic notion of communication is coding. It is coding that
allows they type of communication that they discuss, to exist and to function.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But there is another form of communication that we know
of as conversation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>What conversation gives us is meaning. And it gives us
communication in its own right, that is, as something which is not transparent
but has its own positive qualities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Consider, for a moment, what happens when there is error
in a (first order cybernetic) system - i.e. it does not perform as we would
hope: there is some perturbation, some unpredicted condition, some chaotic
event, some failing in our model or in the control system which leads to
error - that fundamental which is the raison-d'&ecirc;tre of cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We can see the error through comparison of the system's
state as is and as is intended, through the transmission of messages about
that state. But we already have a new value: the value that the discrepancy
is, indeed, an error. I.e., we have given the discrepancy a meaning that
we tag with the name error. Through the mechanism of feedback we may work
(with grand intention) towards reducing and annihilating that error: but
note that the judgement that we have an error causes us to change in our
behaviour so that we change the behaviour we observe in the system and
our consequent evaluation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Indeed, our decision that we have error, giving rise to
the quest for cause, leads to us wishing to indicate the agent of error,
to give it form, pattern, purpose, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus, even in the simple case of communication error and
correction, there is not only the circularity of controlling (as discussed
in earlier articles), but also there is at least the potential for evaluation
and meaning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We can design systems in which error is looked for yet
in which there is no meaning (mechanical and entirely determined systems):
yet it is we who have determined that this is how the world our machine
will inhabit is, and how it should act and react.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Which is to say that there is a constructive base in all
this, a base that is essential to all that we do (and is also a foundational
starting-point for second order cybernetics, i.e. the cybernetics of observing
systems and systems that make meanings, systems in which there is participation).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A constructive base clearly undermines the notion of coding
as the universal means of communication. Indeed, coding becomes, at very
best, merely a special - and highly restricted - case of something much
more general (as Newton's mechanics are taken as merely a special - and
highly restricted - case of Einstein's). For, in a universe where construction
(rather than reception) is the characteristic act, each construction requires
a constructor (or, as George Kelly would have it, a construer) and that
constructor must be different from every other, building his own constructions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>But, under such circumstances, how could we communicate
with others? We have only our own constructions. Can we share at all? Are
there others<SUP>5</SUP>? (Our experience seems to be that there are others,
in some form, and that we can share with them, so we will not explore this
question further here. But how we might communicate is important, for unless
we answer that, we cannot account for the type of communication we are
trying to explore.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is where conversation comes in. The mechanism which
allows us to communicate without having to encode (and all that goes with
it), which not only allows but requires that we construct and are separate,
is the conversation. This will be explored in detail (and after all this
build-up) in the next issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We will discover that conversation is an embodiment of
feedback. Feedback is not strapped on, it is integral. Conversation is
circular. Conversation, existing without coding, requires that we make
our own meanings in our own understandings. Conversation leads of necessity
to (re–)interpretation, to construction; and conversation is the result
of (re-)interpretation and construction. Conversation is at the heart of
communication when we accede that (meaningful) communication does not happen
by coding: yet conversation allows coding as a special (and very impoverished)
case. And conversation is at the heart of cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For Conversation is a (perhaps the) form for communication
when communication is considered in its own right rather than as a subsidiary
requirement for control to occur, when communication is seen as communication
per se. The fact that there is such a means of communication and that encoded
communication is not the only way communication may happen in cybernetic
systems is important, not just because it is a generator of the arguments
for second order cybernetics (as well as being, in the case of the conversation,
a resultant form) but also because this indicates that communication is
a serious and primary contributor in the <I>Wiener characterisation</I>
of cybernetics, meriting serious consideration.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Notes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><SUP>1</SUP> I would rather be able to assert, and have
accepted, that meaning requires us to construct it, each of us individually,
and meaning cannot, therefore, be communicated by transmission, nor can
it be encoded, for it seems to obvious. And that the sharing of meaning
is the central concern of communication. But I am afraid I cannot, for
it is not at all obvious to everyone. So I present some reflections on
coding and the Shannon/Weaver model of communication - their weaknesses
and limitations. These reflections. I hope, will at least give credibility
to what I shall attempt in the next issue: to discuss the apparent sharing
of meaning (hence, communication) through the device of the conversation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><SUP>2</SUP> Which seems to me to take a lot from Turing's
work on (de-)coding, as well as, of course, having its roots directly in
Newton's work on Thermodynamics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><SUP>3</SUP> Unless, of course, there is noise in the
system!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><SUP>4 </SUP>In case I sound negative or dismissive about
this, I am not. I am as keen as the next person to survive when I am in
a aeroplane, for instance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><SUP>5</SUP> I should like to bring to the reader's attention
Heinz von Foerster's argument (made in &quot;On Constructing a Reality&quot;)
against solipsism: first, that if I invent you and then I invent you inventing
me, I have no way of knowing that it was not you who invented me to invent
you: and, secondly, that if you think you have the only right and I think
I have only my own right, you may well insist you are right and I cannot
disprove you, but I will desappear and you will have nothing left except
your own cloud! From this he asserts that, while it is not possible to
disprove your position, it leaves no future or possibilities and is ethically
belittling.</FONT></P>
