<I>Global Transformational Learning Communities</I></H3>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>Robert Theobald is a New Orleans community futurist
who has been working on large-scale, transformative change for over thirty
years. He can be reached at 509 Conti Street, New Orleans, La 70130. Tel.:

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Introduction</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;How do we find myths for the future,<BR>
By spinning them one strand at a time,<BR>
And letting chaos weave them together.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The core distinction between people today is whether they
believe that we can continue with industrial-era success criteria, goals,
models and institutional structures or have recognized that we must move
into a new era. This paper describes an initiative which is pulling together
people who are committed to removing the barriers to the necessary transformation
and supporting each other in positive thought and action. The technique
proposed is to find opportunities for transformational players to think
and work together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A number of science fiction writers have managed to create
a world which is real enough, and exciting enough, that others want to
create stories to enlarge the understanding of this world. This effort
aims to communicate an understanding of the transformed real world which
is sufficiently clear that people feel comfortable being active within
it. Obviously, the complexity of the &quot;real&quot; world is far greater
than any fictional universe but I am convinced that until people can &quot;get
inside&quot; the new world they cannot be thinkers or actors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I am also haunted by an old-testament image. Moses was
prevented from entering the promised land because of his sins on the journey.
It seems to me that we are still stuck outside our promised land. It is
time to pass over: to start to explore the new world which we must inhabit,
its positives and its problems.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why do we need to unblock the transformation </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Irresistible forces of change are now clashing with immovable
traditional ideologies, theologies and theories (e.g., population pressures
vs. reproductive beliefs, ecological limits vs. maximum economic growth
theories, knowledge of health promotion and cost controls vs. medical traditions,
technological change vs. stability beliefs, system thinking vs. centralizing
government).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The result of these clashes is inevitably very rapid,
surprising and unpredictable change. As a result, things are getting better
and better and worse and worse, faster and faster. Events and trends are
heavily affected by timing: e.g., reactions to Rwanda would have been profoundly
different before rather than after Somalia. Some examples of &quot;surprises&quot;:
the fall of the Berlin Wall, the revival of ethnic rivalries, the decline
in standards of living in the developed countries and the rise in unemployment,
the movement against smoking and toward health, the Mexican financial crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Our probable future will be dominated by inertia: past
nightmares, hates, ideologies, theories will continue despite their obsolescence.
This would lead to our current global culture collapsing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The desirable future can only be born if we become hopeful
realists, facing the future with courage, persistence, laughter and joy.
An enormous range of small-scale initiatives are required as well as political
and legal shifts which unblock imagination and courage. We can reinvent
citizenship so as to manage inevitable mindquakes and heartquakes. We can
support all those moving in desirable directions even though their priorities
are different from ours: whether they are shifting current systems in desirable
directions, imagining and creating more suitable structures or helping
people understand the inevitability of fundamental change and its possible
positive outcomes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Institutions, organizations, socio-economies and cultures
will be structured profoundly differently to be appropriate in today's
and tomorrow's world. The Western tradition, which we are now spreading
worldwide, is to search for efficiency: we assume we know what to do and
that the challenge is to do it better. Continuation of this approach will
be disastrous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We can develop systems which struggle toward generative
learning, which are life-supporting, encourage self-consciousness and become
self-evolving. We could then achieve movement toward a higher worldwide
quality of life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are two primary elements in the search for generative
learning. One is discovery of today's realities and driving forces. This
can only be achieved by honest tough dialogue among those with different
points of view, historical perspectives, economic needs, cultural traditions.
A primary challenge is therefore to create open space for dialogue which
both clarifies thinking and enables us to rebuild an understanding of the
importance of healthy relationships. The other step is to struggle to understand
how change takes place. Theologies, the perennial wisdom, system theories,
etc., can converge toward a common view. A positive future will be based
on a movement toward a more open society using the values of honesty, responsibility,
humility, love and a respect for mystery (uncertainty/chaos) as a compass.
A new compassionate era is being born. We are not in charge. Our task is
to provide the needed support and to permit the process to continue.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Why transformative change is profoundly difficult</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are unfortunately major blocks to all of the required
changes: These relate to the arguments in the previous section:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Traditional ways of thinking emphasize continuity and
attempt to understand the future in terms of the past. We drive looking
in the rear-view mirror. (The strength of this pathology was shown in &quot;The
End of History&quot; which argued that no further major changes would take
place in the world.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Our political systems are not normally designed to develop
a more humane future: rather they aim to return to the past and wipe out
the result of perturbations. Theologies tend to concentrate on past realties
(values as anchor) rather than on the future (values as compass). Organizational
development assumes a move from one stable state to another.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Information overloads are today so severe that surprises
are easily forgotten. Attention passes from one event to another. The new
becomes the commonplace without reflection, whose importance is deeply
undervalued in our culture. Instead of taking time to recognize the need
for a mindquake, we continue to operate in old styles. We therefore find
it almost impossible to distinguish significant trends from short-run blips.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Our attempts to deal with current crises all too often
repeat, and deepen, past causes of failure. The problem is that we fail
to recognize that when one is in a hole, the first necessary step is to
stop digging it deeper. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The escape from crises comes when we look more broadly
at the situation and discover new positive directions. We are increasingly
aware that people are baffled, frustrated and angry. If we do not tackle
root causes, this will lead to breakdown. If we do face up to current crises,
then we have the possibility of moving in positive directions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Rewards go the efficient and not those who engage in generative
learning. One must often work against narrow, short-run self-interest if
one's actions are to enhance potentials for collective long-term societal
and ecological health. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>On the other hand, a correct, broad, long-run understanding
of trends will lead people to see that they will benefit from supporting
patterns of behavior which develop both themselves and others. Enabling
people to see new patterns requires that we change our success criteria
and also the way we conceptualize the world. We need to learn to operate
within a profoundly changed set of conditions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We live in a cultural trance: the most vital topics are
rarely discussed because they are too threatening: e.g., the infeasibility
of full employment, the failure to promote health, our attempt to pretend
that objectivity is feasible. We have been taught to reach our conclusions
from a given set of assumptions rather than to work to discover whether
assumption patterns, drawn from the past and applied in the present, are
still relevant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The most critical failures of understanding are not between
two &quot;sides&quot; of a defined argument where positions are clear but
rather between those who can see a new issue and those who deny its very
existence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The very way most modern languages are constructed (particularly
English) makes intelligent dialogue very difficult. We should regard the
loss of languages around the world as seriously as we regret the loss of
biological diversity. Languages, such as the Gaelic, force us to understand
in more artistic and consciousness-driven terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Another problem is that we think in dichotomous terms.
We either see the world as fixed, tidy, objective and unchallengeable or
we move to the opposite extreme and deny the relevance of any search for
standards, morality and intelligent choice. It is only as we learn to live
in tension between these extremes through exploration that effective choices
can be made. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Most seriously of all, most of our patterns avoid the
poetic, the artistic, the uncontrollable forces which affect our lives.
Humanity wants to run things: not move with forces larger than ourselves.
We need to be entrepreneurial stewards, not policy makers.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Producing effective thought and action models</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If we are to be effective we must develop a new understanding
of how the world works and how we interact with that world. We must, above
all, recognize that each of us works from a picture of reality which is
inevitably subjective, partial and flawed. The further people have moved
on their personal journey, the more interesting and coherent their picture
will be but it will never be accurate, complete or objective. Our learning
processes should therefore be set up to ensure continuous compassionate
challenge of our ways of thought, action, visioning, etc, so we can develop
our own capabilities and those of others. Our challenge is to &quot;art&quot;
a new universe as well as to develop new intellectual understandings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>We must also recognize that people learn in different
ways. Some think, some act: some find playing with ideas exciting, some
do not. We need to support a wide variety of patterns which make it possible
for people and groups to change their thinking to keep up with new realities.
We need to help people achieve small, continuing mindquakes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The statement I've just made necessarily implies a hierarchy
of skills. Some people, through luck, experience, teaching, hard work and
other factors, have moved further along in the way. They therefore have
the responsibility to teach what they know as effectively as they can.
The implications of this approach are very different both from industrial-era
patterns and &quot;meritocracy&quot; models: nobody is skilled in all fields
and each of us should be assumed to be competent in making our own decisions
unless there are overwhelming reasons to challenge this belief. This discussion
moves us into the field of servant leadership and sapiental authority.
This is one example of the &quot;tension&quot; issue with which we must
struggle if we are to be effective. Hierarchies which fail to recognize
their fallibility are dangerous: but so are systems which deny the reality
of a hierarchy of skills. We must learn to live in the middle ground.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The skills of each one of us are necessarily a very small
portion of those which are needed for clear thought and effective action.
We need to work very closely with others who have other skills than our
own. We need to tease out the threads of our agreements, disagreements
and differences of emphasis far more carefully, slowly and tenderly than
we have yet had the patience to do. We need to learn how our assumptions
blind us to key parts of reality and to become progressively more skilled
at managing the mindquakes which occur as we understand factors we have
previously ignored.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>As we struggle to develop appropriate models we must recognize
that approaches which fail to deal with the reality of excess stress, overload,
infoglut and gigo will inevitably collapse. People need the opportunity
to interact in small competent groups which are concerned with specific
opportunities and directions. There also need to be ways for this information
to be shared broadly and rapidly. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Basic challenge and task</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The learning styles, success criteria and institutions
of the twenty-first century must be profoundly different from those of
the twentieth if we are to survive. We can only discover what will be effective
if we look for the strengths in various groups, cultures, political traditions
and religious emphases while discarding their weaknesses. This requires
tough dialogue so that new understandings can be achieved.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Three areas need primary attention:</FONT></P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Development of success criteria suitable for the profoundly
new conditions humanity has created for itself. These changes in success
criteria require us to rethink how to link work, income and purpose; relate
the economy and the environment; encourage people to stay healthy; resolve
disputes; make effective decisions etc. Enabling people to perceive what
these success criteria are, communicating their implications and ensuring
their adoption is one primary challenge. The work which will be coordinated
by Transformational Learning Communities, will deal primarily with this
challenge.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>New success criteria inevitably emerge from, and require
the development of, a fundamentally changed way of seeing the world. Many
of the most basic understandings for this shift are now in place. We now
know that our understandings of the outside world are driven by consciousness
rather than objectivity. It is for this reason that we must be able to
compare our understandings with those of others. We are also becoming aware
that we need far more differentiated approaches if our activities are to
be relevant. Many of the articles in this journal are designed to develop
understandings at this level.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>New success criteria also demand different institutional
structures and methods of behavior. For most people, the development of
new understandings does not emerge from intellectual thinking but by developing,
or using, new tools and new structures which make it possible for the new
success criteria to be realized. One problem today is that there is little
sense that rapidly developing ideas for new institutions, tools, structures,
etc., have a common base. Another is that there are no easily available
sources for information about these institutions, tools and structures.
Bill Ellis, Tranet, Box 567, Rangeley, Maine 04970-0507 is moving to catalogue
many of these approaches and encourage effective action in context. Other
efforts are also getting underway.</FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Creating a transformed system</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Transformational Learning Communities will encourage competent
people to interact and learn from each other. It will also develop new
approaches which emerge from the assumptions of this effort. </FONT></P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>One of them will develop new forms of interaction which
recognize that we live in a consciousness-driven world. We need profoundly
different approaches which assume that the task is to help others examine
their current understandings creatively and thus improve the congruence
between their view of the world and &quot;reality.&quot; (The word reality
is placed in quotes because there are immensely difficult philosophical
issues here. This is not the place to deal with them.) We know that inner
skills and outer work must develop in parallel and that only those who
have moved along in their own journey can possibly work effectively with
others.</FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is a generic idea so there are a very large number
of ways to achieve interactions and a number are already emerging. Here
is one specific approach set out as a way to encourage other people to
think about alternative patterns: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A group of about a dozen people choose to work together
on a subject of common interest. (Note that one looks for &quot;a&quot;
suitable group -- not &quot;the&quot; group.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Each person in the core group then writes the briefest
possible statement that expresses core commitments, understandings and
questions. This is made available to all the other members. Then for a
given period, (say a week, fortnight or month), the group concentrates
on the vision of one person. They challenge positively and creatively.
At the end of the period, a new person's views are examined while the person
who has been challenged rewrites his/her statement. This effort can be
most easily conducted within a conference on one of the computer systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At the end of this process, everybody should be significantly
clearer about their own views and about the questions which are unresolved.
At this point, a second round could occur, possibly with some changed players.
Or a face-to-face meeting might occur.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. A further development is to let these conversations
provide leading-edge discussions from which others can learn. Approaches
will be developed to permit people to listen to these dialogues. </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The simplest possible model is to provide &quot;read-only&quot;
computer access to anybody who wants to learn about the topic under discussion.
They will be able to follow what is being written but not to interact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A far more exciting model would be to set up a model which
would be mediated by mentors. Learners would read the material as it was
produced and they would be able to interact (by e-mail or face to face)
with a mentor who would guide discussion, clarify points etc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a still more complex approach, mentors would have their
own conference and would be able to introduce the most important ideas
which they, or their students, develop back to the core group. (Access
would still be limited to prevent the core group from being overwhelmed.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are two primary types of organization which might
set up learner and mentor systems. One would be in connection with existing
and emerging educational systems. The other would be in communities working
with existing service clubs, non-profits, foundations etc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Transformational learning communities will create new
knowledge as people work with each other and produce a shared vision of
their topic. Once this has been achieved, there will be two tasks. The
first will be to &quot;translate&quot; the material both in terms of various
media and levels of difficulty. The second will be to find those who have
the skills to move the created products and processes effectively and to
get attention for them in our current overloaded world</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The basic hope is that people will become aware of the
degree to which an overall view of a new way of acting and being already
exists. Here are a few other projects which could make a difference in
moving toward this goal:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>a) development of short booklists for various audiences
which would provide a starting point for understanding of transformation:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>b) development of a bookclub on transformational subjects,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>c) development of a set of names for the media so they
would know who to approach to learn about transformational thinking,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>d) asking bookstores to install a section on transformation,
as they did on women's studies,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>e) creating &quot;chautauquas&quot; which combine the
arts and speakers in communities across the country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>f) developing a transformational Whole Earth Catalogue
</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Results</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Only people who are aware of the requirement for truly
fundamental change will be excited by this proposal. It is not necessary,
therefore, to stress that the most important outcomes of this effort are
unpredictable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This effort will go forward at three levels:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>a) it will link a growing number of individuals and groups
who are convinced that fundamental change is necessary in the immediate
future,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>b) it will develop, and support, specific strategies and
tactics to move in this direction,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>c) it is intermeshing with other significant large-scale
efforts with convergent goals.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>APPENDIX 1<BR>
UNBLOCKING THE TRANSFORMATION DIRECTIONS AND EVALUATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The list that follows sets out ways of evaluating proposals
one is considering and helps to determine whether one is moving in positive
directions. It is highly improbable that all the criteria will be met for
any effort but if the effect of an activity is contradictory to one of
these principles, one may need to ask if it can be reorganized. The need
is not for &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;completeness&quot; because this
is impossible. It is to remain ever conscious of the patterns behind the
models one creates so that one can watch for opportunities and problems
as they emerge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Does the activity one intends to develop:</FONT></P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Emphasize the opportunities in a situation rather than
the problems?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Encourage creative and generative thinking?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>See healthy relationships as essential to effective activity?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Connect with authentic personal, family and community
needs rather than those mediated by media and ideology.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Acknowledge the importance of spirituality and passion?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Recognize the importance of using values as a compass
which guide our choices? (My own short listing is honesty, responsibility,
humility, love, faith and a respect for mystery.)</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Encourage us to move beyond dichotomized thinking?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Help us understand that while everything is connected
we must &quot;bound&quot; the realities we consider if we are to be able
to think or act at all? (This approach contrasts with the past when we
tried to develop a complete, objective map of &quot;reality.&quot;)</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Enable us to recognize that there are personal, relational
and ecological limits, as well as critical thresholds which are unknowable?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Acknowledge and empower competence based on knowledge,
skills, abilities, wisdom, perspectives and experience rather than coercive
power?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Encourage us to face our own patterns and to recognize
that strengths always carry weaknesses with them (facing our shadows)?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Learn that we can make progress together to the extent
we show maturity by understanding and transforming our ego needs and placing
them in a broader context?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Recognize that people operate in their perceived self-interest
because they have to screen reality through their own senses and also understand
that this does not mean that people will necessarily see their &quot;self-interest&quot;
narrowly or selfishly because they will be aware, to a greater or lesser
extent, of community values, nature's requirements, system feedback patterns
and the implications of mystery which prevents complete understanding at
any time.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Learn that people will inevitably see the world very
differently and that reactions will therefore be highly diverse -- that
the world can only operate successfully as we accept the validity of multiple
viewpoints. Careful and active listening is a core requirement for effectiveness.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Discover that our collective intelligence -- our ability
to see, think and respond together -- depends largely on how we use our
diversity to learn from the disturbances and changes we face for they can
show us the opportunities of our time?</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+0>Support the emergence of new systems which will increasingly
be self-sustaining given the realities of our new era?</FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>APPENDIX 2 <BR>
CHOOSING STRATEGIES TO UNBLOCK THE TRANSFORMATION</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Effective change requires a multiplicity of tools, models,
directions and strategies. Unfortunately, few people, groups and institutions
recognize this. While it is appropriate for an individual or group to concentrate
on its own strategy, nothing important will be achieved unless one supports
and recognizes the efforts of others who are moving in convergent directions.
True learning is mutual learning. We must discover the truths of others
as we share our own. All our understandings must be seen as uncertain and
in flux except our absolute commitment to move as best we can in directions
which increase capacity and empower. (These words have been &quot;polluted&quot;
but they are the best I know to convey my belief.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Listed below are elements which should be considered as
one develops approaches to unblock the transformation:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>a) Levels of competence:</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>i) If people are unaware of the need for fundamental change,
provide information on what is happening in the culture<BR>
ii)connected,&quot; help them grasp the impossibility of changing only
one thing. <BR>
iii) If people are aware of change and connections, help develop action
programs which support personal, institutional and community competence
and capacity building.<BR>
iv) If people are committed to development of competence, get out of their
way as they learn how to act for themselves.<BR>
v) If people are capable of acting for themselves, form positive coalitions
and create synergies through creative quietness.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>b) Scales of Action</B><U>:</U> One of the most important
challenges is to decide on the scale at which you choose to work for a
particular effort. The underlying principles are necessarily the same whatever
your actions, but the patterns will vary depending on whether you want
to move individuals, families, sub-neighborhoods, neighborhoods, communities,
bioregions, global patterns or political entities including parishes, states,
counties and nation states.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>c) Learning Styles.</B> The essential goal in the learning
process is to communicate as much as one can through interaction. We can
only teach people what they already know by providing language and images
to clarify their understanding. There are many learning styles: if we are
to unblock the transformation we must provide learning opportunities not
only for those who are logical and rational but for those who gain understandings
through action, personal interactions and internal reflection.</FONT></P>
