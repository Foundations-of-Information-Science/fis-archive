<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Abstract</FONT></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>In this paper I identify five logical fault lines in
Ernst von Glasersfeld’s exposition and defense of radical constructivism
(RC). Ordered, roughly, from the epistemological-metaphysical to the social-political-educational,
the five are as follows: (1) that the constructive nature of the knowing
process necessarily restricts in some important way that which can be known;
in particular, (2) that we cannot know (on any non-mysterious interpretation
of the word &quot;know&quot;) the metaphysical realist’s mind - or language
- independent objects of knowledge; (3) that RC is an ontologically neutral
doctrine, resting somewhere beyond the dispute between metaphysical realism
and idealism; (4) that RC is compatible with a focus on the social or linguistic
nature of experience; and, finally, (5) that RC is an inherently progressive
or tolerant theory.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Worldmaking and mind's perfect autonomy are a delusion,
one resulting when the truth of hypotheses is misdescribed in the terms
appropriate to mind's responsibility for its constructions.</FONT></P>
