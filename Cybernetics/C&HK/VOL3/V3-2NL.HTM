<I>Why &quot;Systems Theory&quot;?</I></H3>

<P><B>I</B></P>

<P>For a long time the thinking in systems has experienced a need for legitimation
in relation to common sense and ordinary, everyday comprehensibility. &quot;The
most ingenious way of becomming foolish, is <I>by a system</I>&quot;. Shaftesbury
thought, and concerning the mathematical student he said: &quot;All he
desires is to keep his head sound, as it was before&quot;.<SUP>1 </SUP>Currently,
this kind of scepticism is not found so much in relation to systematic,
theoretically based thinking, but rather in relation to any preference
for certain &quot;Grand Theories&quot;. Within the social structure of
modern society there is no position from which one can with authority announce
statements about the world. Similarly, the world has withdrawn to the non-observable.
That line which is drawn by the observer between himself and that which
he observes, must be drawn contingently.<SUP>2</SUP> In this way an original
borderline arises which hsd only validity in relation to the observer and
which by other observers may be drawn in many other ways. Exactly this
can be reflected by declaring the &quot;unmarked state&quot; (Spencer Brown)
for non-observable; and by arranging a second order observation: an observation
of observations, a description of descriptions in order to find out whether
such recursive procedures might produce valid forms, &quot;Eigenvalues&quot;
which could stand firm in relation to such a procedure.<SUP>3 </SUP>It
is my hypothesis that &quot;systems theory&quot; belongs to that kind of
Eigenvalues within modern intellectuality; not least because this theory
is able to reflect and to understand the condition of self-creation in
the unmarked state of the non-observable world.</P>

<P>It is only another version of the same perspective when one takes the
notion of the contingency of all forms, all distinctions, all laws as one's
starting point.<SUP>4 </SUP>The totally indefinite cannot be anything but
what it is. As soon as something definitely happens or is being made, new
posibilities arise. It may be an accidental beginning, or a beginning which
shows no consideration for what is already present (for instance the first
step of the creation of a work of art); but when something happens or is
being made, a limitation arises as to how to go on. A story of adaptation
starts which reduces the free space of what is still possible without through
this being able to resolve the contingency of all definitenesses. One will
always be able to see new possibilities without necessarily being able
to realise them. The world of meaning is based on dissatisfaction and not,
as Aristotle thought, on perfection.</P>
