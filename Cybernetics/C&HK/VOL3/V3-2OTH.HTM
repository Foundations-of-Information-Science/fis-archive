<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Abstract</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>An attempt is made to present an idea of morals and
ethics without essentialism and without normative presuppositions. Inspired
by Niklas Luhmann's systems theory, morals is defined as a code, or a distinction
between right and wrong. Moral observation is using the moral code with
a view of designating one or the other side of the code. In order to distribute
the two sides, the code must be combined with a program which must be interpreted
in concrete situations. As both code, program and interpretation may be
contested, morals is a controversial affair. Despite classical ambitions,
its validity is not universal, but local. Moral pluralism is used as point
of departure for a new concept of ethics, using an extreme reduced version
of the Apel-Habermasian idea of discourse ethics, but without any normative
idea of rationality. Ethics has to do with shared values among parties
with different moral positions. This concept of ethics may be used in organizations,
which are defined as autopoietic systems with decisions as the self-created
elements. Ethics may be used as a new premise for decision making in organizations
and may compensate for problems which are inherent in using the normal
codes of money and power. Four problem areas are dealt with: the problem
of identity, the problem of blindness, the problem of non-knowledge, and
the problem of control of the uncontrollable.</I> </FONT></P>
