<I>The Eigen-value of Stories</I></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Abstract</FONT></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>The notion of <B>eigen-value</B>, contributed by von
Foerster to the field of cybernetics, can be usefully applied to the understanding
of the transformative process of narratives in therapy. When problem-sustaining
narratives are destabilized during therapy, they &quot;seek&quot; new steady
states, they become more sensitive to, and craving for, the incorporation
of new elements or logic provided throughout the therapeutic conversation.
These fit-hungry, unstable, incompletely formatted stories end up gelling
around new <B>eigen-values</B>. The new configuration will replace the
problem-sustaining story with stories that are problem-free or, at least,
problem-solving.</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Prologue</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I am honored and overjoyed by the opportunity to participate
in this Festschrift in which we render homage to Heinz von Foerster and
acknowledge his vast contribution to cybernetics and his influence in so
many other fields. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I wish to offer you, Heinz, a wild flower of an idea generated
by your intellectual seed.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>...But first, a disquisition on etymology </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Some ten years ago, in Brussels, in the course of a keynote
address delivered by Heinz in a Congress on Systems, Families, and all
that jazz, I heard for the first time his erudite lucubration about the
etymology of the words &quot;epistemology&quot;, &quot;understanding&quot;
and &quot;Verstehen&quot; and their similar way of denoting the relationship
to knowledge entailed in the position of the knower (v.Foerster 1985).
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>Epistemology</I>, Heinz reminded us, derives from the
Greek, and is composed by a prefix, <I>epi</I>, to mean &quot;up&quot;
or &quot;above&quot;, and the word <I>histamein</I>, &quot;to stand&quot;.
Therefore, it could well be translated as &quot;standing above&quot;, or
&quot;upper-standing&quot;, an interesting position, as those proficient
in the English language prefer to stand under, that is, to <I>understand</I><U>.</U>
In turn, he also noted, the German word for the operation of understanding,
<I>Verstehen</I><U>,</U> is composed by the prefix <I>ver</I>--change,
loss, reversal-- and the word <I>stehen</I>, &quot;to stand&quot;. He proposes
then that a literal translation of the German word could be <I>un</I>-<I>standing</I>.
Upper-standing, under-standing, or un-standing, these words concur in placing
the subject at a meta-, recursively observant position, removed from where
he/she stands and thus acquiring a vantage point from which to grasp a
view of the subject as a whole. (It is in that paper, mind you, that Heinz
noted the usual rendition of epistemology as &quot;theory of knowledge&quot;,
and swiftly re-translated that into &quot;theory of understanding&quot;
and, as theories bring understanding, into understanding understanding,
second-order understanding, U<SUP>2</SUP>, one of his trademark logos.)
