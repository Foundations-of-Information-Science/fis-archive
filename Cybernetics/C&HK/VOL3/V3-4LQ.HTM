<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Summary</FONT></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+0>In his book <B>The Construction of Social Reality,</B>
John Searle discusses the classical question of how society and social
institutions are possible if they are human constructions and not &quot;brute
facts&quot;. His basic argument is that although social institutions exist
only because we believe them to exist, they still exist as facts in the
world to which we can refer. The main part of his book is about the factual
existence of social institutions, i.e. about social facts and the role
of language in constituting such facts and giving them an almost ontological
existence. The book includes as part of the argument a critical discussion
of radical constructivism. In this paper the history of the topic is summarised,
and the main arguments of Searle’s book are presented. In particular, various
versions of constructivism are specified with reference to the definition
of the external world, the social world and the human &quot;I&quot;. Finally,
the problem regarding &quot;infinite regress&quot; or circularity (that
we refer to something which exists only because we refer to it) is reflected
upon.</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+0>How is Society possible?</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Searle’s book is about the question &quot;How is society
possible?&quot; This has been a basic concern for social theory at least
since Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), cf. his <I>Leviathan</I> from 1651 &quot;...on
the matter, form, and power of a commonwealth ecclesiastical and civil&quot;,
as the subtitle says. How is commonwealth possible among people who are
not united through internal ties? While his <I>question</I> was modern
- representing the modern, individualised human being - his <I>answer</I>
was pre-modern: It is necessary to unite these individuals through external
power, e.g. through a sovereign state. It is the state that makes society
possible.</FONT></P>
