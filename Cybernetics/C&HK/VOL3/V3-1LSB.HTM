<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>Gregory Bateson's interdisciplinary work in Anthropology, Psychiatry,
Evolution and Epistemology was profoundly influenced by the ideas set forth
in systems theory, communication theory, information theory and cybernetics.
Bateson used the single term cybernetics in reference to an aggregate of
these ideas that grew together shortly after World War II. For him, cybernetics,
and communication theory, and information theory, and systems theory, together
constituted a unified set of ideas. Apparently, many scholars and practitioners
of the social/behavioral sciences, as well as the humanities, were first
introduced to the cybernetic paradigm through Bateson's work. Yet, he seldom
offered his audience more than a cursory reference to the key principles
underlying cybernetics. Hence, this essay incrementally and historically
delineates the fundamental principles underlying the cybernetic paradigm
as it was employed by Bateson. </P>
