<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A practiced reader can usually read quite a few different
meanings into a text, because even the most commonplace prose is not a
one-way street. Rabelais, Shakespeare, Pirandello, and Joyce have artfully
exploited this openness. Philosophy - in my mind at least - is a more stringent
game. Not that its language is any less ambiguous, but the persistent reader
learns to strive for a different goal. It is neither the multiplicity of
interpretations that thrills him, nor the feat of proving any of them wrong
- he or she has come to realize that it may be more profitable to find
an interpretation that could have made sense to the author.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>I began my response to David Johnson with this somewhat
pompous observation, because it is not the first time I am asked to respond
to him and it now seems pointless to reformulate my views. He states them
quite succinctly in his abstract and calls them &quot;logical fault lines&quot;.
In my vocabulary, &quot;logic&quot; pertains to the connections we make
in our thinking, not to what we are thinking about. There is neither anything
&quot;logical&quot; in the assertion that all men are mortal nor in its
contradiction that all men are immortal - but if we then say that Socrates
is a man, his fate within the given context is determined by logic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Logic does apply to our use of words. Once we have defined
them, it requires that we use them in ways that are consistent with our
definition. If we write them in a text, we expect the reader to keep our
definitions in mind. If, for instance, I defined &quot;knowledge&quot;
in more than a dozen places as a commodity that is gathered, abstracted,
or constructed by the knower from his or her experience, I am not saying
anything about how this experience may or may not be related to the independent
world to which David Johnson claims to have access through some windows.
My &quot;knowledge&quot;, too, is about things, but they are experiential
things and the ways in which I relate them. They are not unicorns or things-in-themselves
(it would be useful to remember that Kant called the in-itself a &quot;heuristic
fiction&quot;).</FONT></P>
