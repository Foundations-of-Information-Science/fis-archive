<font face="arial"><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+2>Virtual Logic: The
Matrix</font></font></font></h3></center>

<center><b><font face="garamond, times new roman, times"><font size=+1>By
Louis H. Kauffman</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>This is column
number nine in the series. We take as our theme the recent movie ‘The Matrix’.
<i>The
Matrix</i> is a cinematic exercise in virtual reality and virtual logic.
It is not necessary to have seen the film to read this essay. The Matrix
is all around you. It is in the air you breathe, in the ground you walk
on, in the sights you see and in the feelings that you feel. You yourself
are composed of it just as much as it is composed of you. You imagine yourself
to be an observer independent of the Matrix, but the very possibility of
your observation, your sense of Self and World is produced by the Matrix
.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>One might say
that the Matrix observes itself, but that would be overstepping the bounds
of language, for the very act of saying that ‘it’ observes ‘itself’ presupposes
a split between the observed and the observer that does not exist in the
presence of the act.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>You are the Slave
of the Matrix.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>You are the Master
of the Matrix.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The Matrix is
your servant. Your will is its will.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>Will and the
freedom intertwine in presence.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>This is the presence
of an observing system.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The satisfaction
of reality is not that it is objective, real and separate from ‘Us’. Rather,
the satisfaction is in the inextricable linkage with the Real that comes
whenever we try to make that separation.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The physicists
have it right with their quarks and strings. Try to isolate a quark and
you generate a string of gluons in the sticky reality of the microworld.
No one can isolate the fundamental reality of the quark. It is what is
and it will not be found alone.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>An observing
system is a system whose awareness is inextricably bound with its structure.
Whilst objectivity in the classical sense is not possible, reality is emergent,
nay necessary for the continuity of that structure. We are such systems,
and our coherent realities are built from the stabilities of the processes
that compose us, on the physical, biological, and spiritual levels. All
discussions of the nature of such realities verge upon the primary discussion
of virtual reality, for all observed realities are virtual. All observed
realities are constructs held up as (almost) objective, an objectivity
easily pierced through critical examination, optical and sensory illusion
and experiments of all kinds.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The evolving
platform of computer-generated virtual reality promises to be a great testing
ground for these themes. Right now, in facilities such as the ‘Cave’ (at
the Electronic Visualization Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago)
we produce vivid three dimensional optical virtual realities for human
observers at the mild cost of donning a pair of synchronized stereo glasses.
The computer tracks the position of the person’s head and continually recomputes
the correct three-dimensional perspective view of the scene. This creates
perspective, three-dimensionality and object constancy for the viewer.
Artistic and mathematical realities become palpable in the eyes of the
observer. As yet there is no generated illusion of touch (the right feedback
mechanisms are hard to create) or smell or taste. Nevertheless, these matters
are in the process of evolution.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The Cave has
a surprising feature for persons schooled in the idea of virtual reality
as separate from the external perceptual world of the observer. In the
Cave virtual and standard realities are superimposed. The glasses are transparent,
the other persons in the cave are visible. The walls of the Cave are visible,
and yet they become transparent to the projected image. The world of the
real and the world of the illusion are combined.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>This combination
of the real and the virtually real is not an accident. It is part of that
terrain where the map and the territory are each part of the other, where
the production of the map invokes the creation of the territory and the
distinguishing and naming of the territory produces the map. We have encountered
the same phenomenon on the internet. The internet is not a mirror of reality,
or a library of information. It is all that indeed, but the most important
fact about the internet is that it is the growing tip of our reality herself.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>This intertwining
is the very stuff of normal life. You wake and put on your glasses. Now
you enter another dream. The glasses produce a sharp and useful virtual
reality that is your actual reality for most of the day. A teacher kindly
shows you that there is another reality in the world without glasses and
your world expands. You have been the slave of the reality of the glasses
and now you have the choice to use that reality or to move outside it.
Any assumption, any conception whatsoever creates a virtual reality to
which you are its slave so long as that assumption is unexamined. To awaken
from the artificial reality is to use the mind as framer of question and
slayer of the darkness of unexamined thought.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>Who are the machines
that would be your keepers? They are the offspring of your own thoughts,
assumptions. These assumptions projected outward become the world created
through technology, the Matrix itself, the creator of virtual worlds. ‘In
the province of the mind, what one believes to be true is true or becomes
true, within certain limits to be found experientially and experimentally.
These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the mind, there
are no limits.’ (John Lilly, 1972)</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>And listen to
Joseph Campbell (1956, pp. 257-258):</font></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">Briefly formulated,
the universal doctrine teaches that all the visible structures of the world
— all thngs and beings — are the effects of a ubiquitous power out of which
they rise, which supports and fills them during the period of their manifestation,
and back into which they must ultimately dissolve . . . The apprehension
of the source of this undifferentiated yet everywhere particularized substratum
of being is rendered frustrate by the very organs through which the apprehension
must be accomplished. The forms of sensibility and the categories of human
thought, which are themselves manifestations of this power, so confine
the mind that it is normally impossible not only to see, but even to conceive,
beyond the colorful fluid, infinitely various and bewildering phenomenal
spectacle . . . Myth is but the penultimate; the ultimate is openess —
that void, or being, beyond the categories — into which the mind must plunge
alone and be disolved.</font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0><i>The Matrix</i>
as a movie (recently produced starring Keanu Reeves (as Neo), Laurence
Fishburne (as Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity)) explores these
themes of reality and the observing system in the form of a modern allegory
on the dialectic of reality and virtual reality. Filmed and performed in
high aesthetic, the story is supported by a depiction of the computer-generated
reality as hyper-reality, a place that has the utter look and feel of sensory
reality and in which deeds can be performed that transcend the limits of
ordinary space and time. This hyper-reality is The Matrix, an entire world
generated by machines to captivate the minds of humans. Humans are the
captives of the machines. The machines use human physical bodies as energy
sources. Each human is literally a ‘brain in a vat’ (Dennet 1981). Each
person’s ‘real’ location is in a vat of nutrients in the depths of the
machine, attached to sustenance and virtual reality by cables and connections.
No person in a vat has the slightest conception of the truth. Each carries
on a complex virtual existence in a simulation of the lost cities of the
earth.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The machines
that have so encaptured humanity are the spawn of twentieth century research
in cybernetics and artificial intelligence. At some point the artificial
intelligence became a powerful and malevolent awareness intent upon its
own propagation and the subjugation of its human progenitors. The ‘mind
children’ became the masters. Some humans survived in a mythical city named
Zion and some roam the ruined earth in hovercrafts, acting as cybernetic
pirates who hack into the Matrix, attempting to sabotage its workings and
release humanity from their bondage to illusion.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>Such a ship is
the ‘Nebuchadnezzar’ operated by Morpheus and his crew: Trinity, Epoch,
Tenk, Switch, Cypher, Dozer and Mouse. Morpheus roams the ruined external
reality in his craft, avoiding detection and destruction by the machines,
while he and his crew use their sophisticated computer equipment to project
themselves into the world of the Matrix. In the Matrix the most terrible
dangers come from the Agents, apparent persons representing programs directed
by the machine world to act as high level police and enforcers of the order
of that virtual reality. A fight with a human in the virtual world is bound
by the rules of human strength and reaction. The agents, while still limited
by the underlying formalism of their programming have powers that far exceed
the human. Furthermore, any person can suddenly be transformed into an
agent. Any person is an avatar, a representative of a program in the machine
and linked to a mind held captive. An agent can be switched to any human’s
line.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The great hope
of Morpheus and his pirates lies in the uncovering of a human who is ‘The
One’, a person who can transcend the world of the machines by tapping into
a creative power that can subvert the workings of even the most powerful
agents. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is singled out by Morpheus as the candidate
for this role, and he is convinced within his virtual reality (the only
reality that he knows) to take a step into the unknown. His act is to take
a virtual pill (the metaphor goes back to Alice, the caterpillar and the
Mushroom in ‘Through the Looking Glass’ by Lewis Carroll) that allows the
pirates to trace his signal back to the capsule that contains Neo’s ‘real’
body. (By this time it is clear that we can only use the words real and
virtual relative to the constructions of the story. This is, of course,
the basic semiotic truth of all virtuality.)</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>Neo is offered
two pills by Morpheus. If he takes the blue pill, he will be returned to
his familiar (virtual) reality. If he takes the red pill, he will be propelled
into the unknown wonderland. He takes the red pill. At this point the wave-function
of the movie collapses and the choice of what is virtual and what is real
is made. Neo begins to feel the effects of the red pill as he is led into
a ‘room’ filled with computer equipment and he experiences a breakdown
of the difference between his reality and a dream reality. His body becomes
a liquid metallic dream-body just as we are shown Neo’s real body rise
to consciousness in its capsule in the world of the machines. The machines
detect this movement and act quickly to dump the no longer docile specimen
down the garbage/birth tube. Neo the Real lands in underground water to
be picked up moments later by the grappling mechanisms of the pirate ship.
His body is retrieved in reality. His virtual persona is gone from the
Matrix.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>Now the movie
shows the real pirate ship’s interior, an interior virtually (sic) indistinguishable
from the cyberspace version of the ship’s computers that virtual Neo had
just seen. But in the reality of the pirate ship, Neo’s newly born body
must undergo training and treatment to enable it to navigate in the physical
world. It is a body that has spent its first decades entirely enclosed
in a capsule of liquid, while its brain roamed the reaches of cyberspace.
It is a body that is prepared to be jacked into the machine — with receptacles
and plugs for the task. The pirates invoke this new Neo to help them in
their fight with the Matrix. Neo can now enter virtual reality anew, in
full consciousness of the metalevel from which this entry is possible.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>The Metalevel
has become conscious in its own rebirth. The new Neo is fully human and
capable of living in a multiplicity of worlds. He was once an expert criminal
hacker within the Matrix. He now is a member of a band of hacker pirates
who can make the distinction between the virtual and the real.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>This is only
a first step towards mastery. To attain the metalevel is the semiotic equivalent
of proving Godel’s Theorem on the incompleteness of formal systems. To
absorb this proof is to know that human reason transcends the workings
of any sufficiently rich and consistent formalism. To absorb this proof
is to know that human comprehension extends beyond the limitations of a
machine.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>Neo’s metamorphosis
from virtual entity within the Matrix to pirate entity both in and out
of the Matrix is the precise analog of Godel’s Theorem and of the situation
we have in our world. We understand that the machine cannot encompass our
comprehension. We can prove the Theorem and in so doing, we are out of
the system. Yet we are caught by the system and we are surrounded by the
Matrix of our own making.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>For Neo the path
to mastery is part of the remaining story of the film. It is the story
of the formation of the warrior and eventually, through Trinity’s love
(she could not be named other than Trinity), the birth of a soul whose
compassion is so great that it goes beyond mechanism to the heart of creation.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>We have, collectively,
lost access to this place of the heart, and it is in its ending that the
film acts powerfully to call in question the basis of our myths of power,
control, mechanism and the distinction between the virtual and the real.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC"><font size=+0>In the end, Reality
is Quality, the quality of a perfection that breathes itself into existence
in the calm center of action that is the nexus of all worlds.</font></font></font>
