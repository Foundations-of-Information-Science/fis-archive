<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">This special issue of <i>Cybernetics
&amp; Human Knowing</i> presents a selection of revised papers delivered
at the workshop ‘Groupware for Self-Organizing Units’ of the Fifth European
Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, held in Stockholm, Sweden.
The theme in focus is the intersection of Self-Organizing Social Systems
and Computer Supported Cooperative Work.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">Self-Organizing Social Systems
(SOSS) is a particular conception of the social phenomena driven by the
more recent developments in experimental epistemology, often associated
with constructivism and the biological theory of living, called autopoiesis.
This argument on the nature of human reality has shown an increasing impact
on the understanding of the social, which differs, in some aspects radically,
when compared with the more established conceptions. The idea of self-organizing
working units has been successfully implemented in industry, on more pragmatic
grounds, for example, in the Swedish car manufacturing company Volvo. One
of the arguments for it’s use is that participatory work-design promotes
both democracy and the ability of adaptation to new and non-forecasted
conditions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">On the other hand, the recent
emergence of the intellectual domain associated with the label Computer
Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has been driven by the developments within
the area of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In a broad
sense, the idea is that various ICT artefacts are employed in order to
support co-operation between individuals, groups, and organizations. Such
tools allow us to treat aspects of working time and space, as well as the
transformation of information, in ways that are not possible without them.
The introduction of these artefacts frequently questions the existing work
processes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">Whilst the two domains of intellectual
inquiry, SOSS and CSCW, are rather recent and still elaborating their respective
foundations, their cross-fertilization is in the very front-line of research.
We cannot and do not want to provide any stable definition of this cross-fertilization.
We would just like to confirm that the analysis and design of CSCW may
take on a new dimension when conceived in terms of SOSS, and the reverse.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">The selected papers present
a blend of theoretical analysis, empirical investigations and methodological
contributions. The first paper, by Christiane Floyd, aims to contribute
to an epistemology of software system design founded in the constructivist
thinking. It discusses four main issues: the design process as an insight
building process with choices made in the design about options available
in the use of a system; the concept of operational form aimed to clarify
the interaction between software systems and human actions; the conception
of methods as recourses in a situated and self-organizing design process;
and finally the inherent ethics of the design process.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">In the second paper Katharina
Just-Hahn and Thomas Herrman propose a method for design and re-design
of business processes. While self-organization promotes autonomy of a human
agent, workflow management systems can serve management as a means to control
business processes. The proposed method, called <i>Step-by-Step</i>, aims
to support self-design of business processes and thus to overcome the tension
mentioned between the autonomy of an employee and its control by the management.
Furthermore, this method, it is argued, makes it possible for a business
organization to adapt rapidly to the challenges that today’s organizations
constantly meet.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">The development of groupware
has been fundamental in the emergence of the so-called virtual enterprises.
In the third paper, Michael Paetau’s empirically driven investigation asks
whether such enterprises should be considered as special forms of social
networks or if they may be seen as social organizations with their own
identity. The study discusses, among other things, the tension between
an organization’s differentiation and integration, which seems to be particularly
pertinent for the behavior of virtual enterprises. The latter will come
to a crossroad, where it must decide between maintaining its virtual character
at the expense of losing its unity, or becoming a non-virtual organization
with its own unity and identity, however losing the properties of a virtual
organization.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">A transition from the more
traditional conception of social organizations that builds on prescription
of its behavior towards a self-organizational conception which self-scribes
its behavior is issued in the fourth paper by Volker Wulf. A question of
investigation into which role CSCW can play to initiate and promote such
a transition. In order to find the answers, two case studies of ICT introduction
are interpreted with the theory of self-organizing social systems. The
result suggests that the self-organization approach is more suitable for
conceptions of social organizations then the more conventional prescriptive
approaches.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Times"><font color="#FFFFCC">In the fifth and final paper,
Kurt Keller provides a critical investigation of N. Luhmann’s theory of
social systems and argues that the theory has limitations with regard to
its potentiality to guide the conception of CSCW; this because of its treatment
of human<i> meaning</i>. Instead, he proposes an alternative that is founded
in the phenomenological tradition.</font></font>
