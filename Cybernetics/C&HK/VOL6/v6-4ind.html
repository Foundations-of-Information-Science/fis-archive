<p>by Soren Brier</center>

<p>The present volume is dominated by three articles that each go deep
into some of the core issues of this journal. Wolff-Michael Roth writes
about "The evolution of Umwelt and Communication" in the educational context
of teaching physics. He fruitfully combines second order cybernetic approaches
with language game theory, Umweltslehre and cybersemiotics in a new way.
He focuses on the co-evolution of ontologies and language games in the
learning process. It is experimentally based on observation of problem
oriented group work around certain teaching experiments in physics that
have been video monitored. In particular he concentrates on the creation
of a common language (game) in the learning process within specific cultural
constraints such as teachers, text books, and the experiment and the other
students.
<p>John Mingers writes an article about "Information, Meaning, and Communica-
tion: an Autopoietic Approach to Linking the Social and the Individual"
that is a constructive critique of Luhmann’s approach to the concepts of
information and communication. Mingers attempts to re-conceptualize the
relation between information and meaning, combining autopoietic terms with
Habermas’ theory of communication and Dretske’s theory of information and
knowledge. This is a new approach he has worked on through several articles,
culminating in the present article with a elaborate schema of various levels
of organizational closure in different systems. He synthesizes Kenneth
Boulding’s work with theories of autopoietic systems and his own further
elaborations. This brings forth new important distinctions and considerations
in socio-communicative theories.
<p>Robin Robertson writes about "Some-thing from No-thing: G.Spencer-Brown’s
Laws of Form" explaining how Spencer-Brown created his algebra that satisfies
all two-valued systems, including Bool’s algebra, in a very clear way.
He then goes on to show how self-reference appears through re-entry in
the system in the form of time developed from the primary distinction that
made space. Through the work of Varela and Kauffman he then shows how Spencer-Brown’s
system, taking the self-reference feedback process in time series, can
be evolved into a three-valued system. He rightly points out that this
new insight has been overlooked. In the previous issue Ort and Peter pointed
out that the limitation of Luhmann’s work in relation to Peirce’s semiotics
is its two-valued logical basis. As I have pointed out in previous articles,
I see the three-valued logic developed by Varela and Kauffman as a mean
to reconcile the opposition between second order cybernetics and semiotics
(in Peirce’s evolutionary pragmaticistic triadic form) and integrate them
into a bigger whole: cybersemiotics.
<p>The last paper of the issue by Yair Neumann reflects on "A Difference
that makes a Difference: Reflections on Artifact-Mediated-Consciousness".
His point is that not only is consciousness a social phenomenon, it is
also a co-genetic phenomenon that may include one or more artifacts. The
computer and other artifacts that expand human perception, thinking, calculating
and communication also shape our consciousness considerably. I would like
to point out that one can look at language as a socially created artifact
that penetrates our consciousness and gives it certain forms, limits it
in certain ways, but expands it in others.
<p>Again we bring columns by Ranulph Glanville musing about art and cybernetics
joining efforts and thus finding new inventive ways in "Thinking the new
Millennium", relating also to the art-editorial politics of this journal.
Louis Kaufmann writes about "The Meta Game paradox" a relative of Russell’s
paradox and related to the "Well-founded Set Paradox". The ASC-column delivers
a recent interview with Heinz von Foerster, "Invitation to Dance" by Christina
Waters, summing up the essence of a life’s work. As promised in the previous
foreword, we bring a review of Allan Comb’s book The radiance of Being
by Stuart Sovatsky. Finally Birgitta Bergvall-K&aring;reborn reviews Checkland
and Holwell’s Information, Systems, and Informatiom Systems.
<p>We thank the artist of this issue, who is Frode Gundorf Nielsen and
to Lawren Bale for the poems.
