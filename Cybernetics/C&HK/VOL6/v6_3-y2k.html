<p><b><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Introduction to this Joint Column</font></b>
<p><b>In early April this year the Conference <u>Problems of Participation
and Communication</u> was held in Amsterdam. Two contributions concerned
the Year 2000 (Y2K) Problem, also known as the Millennium Bug: the Problem
that many computing systems recognise the date partially, by only (for
instance) the last two digits of the year — and will, therefore, confuse
the year 2000 with the year 1900, with consequent, potentially damaging
results. I had been aware of the technical nature of the problem for some
years. What I had not thought through were the social and systemic facets.
The conference presentations brought home the complacency with which I
had been facing the problem. Enquiry amongst other conference attendees
indicated that they, too, had been lax in their thinking.</b>
<p><b>With the Editor's agreement, I therefore decided that on this occasion
I would use this column in an atypical and somewhat political manner, to
bring to the attention of readers something of the nature of the Y2K Problem
and some of the thinking associated with it. To that end, I invited those
conference participants (Prof Stuart Umpleby and Dr Michael Schreiber)
to contribute material for a special column. I also invited a colleague
in New Zealand, Dr Bob Barbour, since I knew he had done a lot of work
in this area and was taking decisive personal action.</b>
<p><b>The process of writing was an interesting example of the conferences
theme (Participation and Communication) as each author offered and then
added to and modified material. In the end, I cut and pasted from this
material, adding the odd phrase, changing wording for consistency, and,
in the case of technical material writing summaries. The final draft was
returned to the (other) contributing authors for their approval, and the
text you see here was created.</b>
<p><b>I did not attempt to silence differences in weighting or to remove
the individuality of contributors' voices, or use of (different varieties
of) English. Far from it. In fact, the author of each section of text can
be seen from the initials following it (see note 1). It is perhaps amusing
to note that the first paragraph of this mosaiced joint text was actually
the concluding section in Bob Barbour's original: the process of mosaicing
has lead, on occasion, to considerable re-ordering.</b>
<p><b>I am specially grateful to my author/colleagues for the generosity
with which they have participated in this project, and to the Editor for
agreeing to this unusual column. I believe, if you are as unprepared as
I and the other conference attendees were, what you read here, while not
directed towards alarm, panic r scaremongering (which should not result
from it), may lead you to want to change certain aspects of your lives
in time for the Millennium celebrations: and that you may wish to advise
your colleagues, friends and relatives. It seems that the powers that be
are keeping quiet and hoping for the best, which may not be the optimal
course of action. Individuals can act otherwise. We can be better informed
and consequently make better decisions than the powers are currently promoting
and facilitating.</b>
<p><b>In the light of what I have discovered, I shall not, now, be going
to Gisborne, New Zealand (Where the Sun Rises First) to join David Bowie
welcoming in the New Millennium. My attitude is simple and self-centred:
I prefer to look a little silly if nothing happens than to be miserable
if something does.</b>
<p><b>THE Y2K PROBLEM</b>
<p><b>Preview</b>
<p><b>According to Information Week, the French don't take it seriously
and the Italians have only just begun considering it. The Africans, generally,
don't have budgets to do anything about it. Russia and the US plan monitors
at each others nuclear sites (warheads, power stations et al.) to report
potential accidents as accidents and not aggressive acts. But the presence
of these monitors is threatened by NATO's war in Kosovo. Russia also demands
$500,000,000 to fix it. In Japan, less than half the corporations responding
to a questionnaire are doing anything about it. And so on and on!</b>
<p><b>IT is the Millennium Bug, the largest problem we have created for
ourselves, yet, and generator of the biggest ever technological and co-operative
project — if that is what it is.</b>
<p><b>The bug works like an audio system: the system is only as good as
its weakest part, and in dealing with the Millennium Bug we are susceptible
not so much to our own shortcomings and lack of preparedness (over which
we have some control), but to those of others (over which we have none).<a href="#BM1">1</a>
Since everything in this cybernetic world of communication and control
is connected to everything else, and since everything is by now infused
with computing chips, the problem is truly worldwide. But it is of our
own making. We could have acted to avoid it, but we chose not to. The consequences
may be serious, even catastrophic, endangering life and social institutions.
We do not know. We cannot know, for the problem is now beyond our imagining
and beyond research, even if we had time. Yet there is much to learn from
the problem. And there is, also, much to decide about how we face it. Below,
some of the contingencies and arguments are presented. [RG]<a href="#BM2">2</a></b>
<p><b>Introduction: Digital Processing</b>
<p><b>The convention of applying digital processing and control to almost
every aspect of society and social activity means that human activities
become vulnerable to the flaws in those systems. The Year 2000 problem
is just one such flaw. Possible problems arise because the convention in
society is to continue to use systems beyond their designed life span.
People have a little time left, when this piece was written in April 1999,
to carry out the overdue computer system maintenance and upgrades that
will ensure that the convention of applying computing power to human problems
can continue to usefully enhance human existence. These systems are found
in every economic sphere of activity from farming to transport to manufacturing
and processing to distribution and retailing. Since there is no sector
to which computing has not been applied there will be no sector of society
not potentially impacted. Failure to properly remediate all suspect systems
across the global information infrastructure will also significantly impact
on every nation in the world. Some of the impact has already been felt
in the millions of dollars expended on Y2K projects. Millions more will
be spent to ensure our conversations with each other are supported by computer
systems that have consistent date conventions. [BB]</b>
<p><b>The World Bank, in January 1999, said most of the worlds developing
countries are woefully unprepared for social and economic disruptions that
are expected from computer malfunctions at the turn of the Millennium.
The U.S. Senate released a report in February 1999 calling Y2K a worldwide
crisis and one of the most serious and potentially devastating events this
nation (the U.S.A.) has ever encountered (U.S. Senate, 1999). Because there
is now not time to fix all affected hardware and software, organizations
and communities are currently developing contingency plans to deal with
disruptions. [SU]</b>
<p><b>The primary issue of Y2K is this: Y2K could lead to complex combinations
of ecologic, commercial and social effects ranging from nuclear risks to
private inconveniences.</b>
<p><b>The secondary issue is: we might actually aggravate the issue by
our efforts to prepare for the worst. [MS]</b>
<p><b>The Origins of the Y2K Problem: A Clash of Conventions</b>
<p><b><u>Date conventions in computing</u></b>
<p><b>Humans experience event sequences (time) as a continuous stream of
unidirectional changes in states. We designate a single event as a base
reference from which to distinguish other events, either those that went
before or those which come after. We provide token names for the base reference
event and for other events. We use rules for describing how the token names
are to be applied to event streams. In shifting from human experience event
streams to computer event streams the event sequence generator (real time
clock) used by the computer to sequence processing events creates only
a finite number of token names. Thus, while there does not appear to be
an end to the sequence of events which humans experience, rules are required
for managing the register roll-over of the finite set of event tokens generated
by a real time clock. Herein lies the first Y2K Problem, handling the roll-over
of real time clock event tokens. This problem particularly affects embedded
chips and embedded systems logic where the way in which the roll-over is
handled cannot be easily established once the devices are in service. Furthermore,
the real-time clocks in embedded systems have different rates of token
generation, different base reference events and rules for managing roll-over.</b>
<p><b>At the level of operating systems within individual computers some
do not automatically use the correct token name to distinguish the change
from year 99 to year 00 as being a Millennium change. In humanly readable
terms 99 is interpreted as 1999 and 00 as 2000, not 1900 because human
perception of dates assumes a priori that dates follow a forward linear
sequence. Herein lies the second Y2K Problem, tokens for dates in a sequence
are never less than the immediately prior event token.</b>
<p><b>At the level of application programs the rules for naming event sequence
tokens cause problems to arise where character values are used, rather
than numeric values. COBOL uses character values for dates. A second translation
and set of rules must be used to ensure that there is a suitable mapping
between the character values for dates in COBOL and a set of numerically
manipulable values where numerical computations are required. Herein, lies
the third possible Y2K Problem, the character which follows in the sequence
from 00 to 99 is 00. In terms of temporal sequences this second 00 is the
token for the event reference 2000 if the base reference is 00 AD. COBOL
dates representations are in character strings (ASCII 75,75 for 99, not
even ASCII 49,75,75,75 for 1999!) not the numeric value 1999. Most large
business systems interact with legacy databases created by systems written
in COBOL. Unless these databases are carefully remediated they will, in
the future, cause problems for current functional systems. The very simple
instance referred to in the COBOL context can potentially apply to many
other legacy databases and the processing systems.</b>
<p><b>There are many ways in which the chosen sequence of reference events
and calendar clock-time name-tokens can be out of synchronisation. Failure
to include provision for the Y2K Leap Year and the associated calendar
events such as the 366th day may also cause problems at all levels of computing.</b>
<p><b><u>Date Conventions in Day to Day Interactions</u></b>
<p><b>In Asia dates may be referenced to significant human events such
as year of the reign of an Emperor or other important person. Most western
people deal with dates at the human scale of days, months and years because
that is the convention we are familiar with. Consequently, we think of
the century digits (18, 19, 20) as being taken for granted. We write cheques
with the date expressed as 02/02/99 instead of saying February 2nd in the
year of Our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Ninety Nine. Computations that require
date values be treated as numeric values, because calculations are required,
introduce significant problems when the values miss the century digits.</b>
<p><b>The convention of omitting the final digits from the year date (originally
to save expensive machine memory see on) causes ambiguity about which century
the year refers to.</b>
<p><b><u>The Clash of Conventions</u></b>
<p><b>The convention of using two digits for year values causes problems
when the year values are used for calculations. The convention of building
embedded systems, without explicitly considering the register role over
problem, causes problems when embedded systems outlast their designed lifespan.
The convention of requiring new software to interact with old software
meant that there was no real incentive to remediate database and other
date sensitive systems.</b>
<p><b>The convention of using date values to trigger events leaves systems
open to date or time related virus and worm software.</b>
<p><b><u>Resolving Problems by Careful Planning.</u></b>
<p><b>Understanding the clash of conventions helps in the process of Hazard
and Risk Evaluation for the Y2K Problem. We reduce the possibility of having
to bear the impact of foreseen events by taking action to mitigate their
possible effects before the event. Checking the way computer systems manage
date-related data at all levels is a mitigation strategy. Because the future
is essentially unknown and the complexity of Y2K Problems is systemic in
nature we also plan to take action should events occur outside of the range
of current preparations. Such contingency plans are designed to reduce
the impact of failures of systems by providing well-understood ways of
working around problems. [BB]</b>
<p><b>Facets Of The Y2K Computer Crisis</b>
<p><b>In the early days of computing one megabyte of memory cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars. Today it costs less than a dollar. Although shortening
four digit dates to two digits, for example 1999 to 99, possibly made sense
at one time, it no longer does. Yet software programs written in the 1950s
and 1960s using the 2 digit year convention are still in use and many have
not been repaired. The use of two digit dates has been a convention that
was widely used until only the last year or two — consider Windows 98.
If date-sensitive computer equipment had been recognized as an important
problem ten or more years ago, it would have remained a technical and management
problem. Since it was not fixed in a timely fashion, it is now a social,
economic, and political problem. There are several facets to the Y2K computer
crisis.</b>
<p><b>a) Mainframes and PCs are vulnerable on several levels (see above).
Hardware, operating systems, application programs (e.g., a spreadsheet
program), and specific applications (e.g., a spreadsheet containing two
digit macros) all need to be checked. Fixing Y2K is the largest technical
project in human history. There are many management challenges involved
in making the repairs: large projects with fixed deadlines, overseas contractors,
unfamiliar tools, and psychological issues (blame, guilt, and denial).</b>
<p><b>b) Embedded systems were recognized as a Y2K Problem only in about
1997. Of the chips that are manufactured only 10 to 15 percent go into
computers and calculators. The rest go into automatic control equipment.
This equipment is used in networks that distribute water, electricity,
and natural gas. Consider the case of a utility company. If an electric
utility does not repair its computers and software, it will not be able
to bill customers or pay employees. But if, however, it does not fix its
embedded systems, it will not be able to generate electric power. Embedded
systems are also used in chemical plants, refineries, and nuclear reactors.
If embedded systems are not repaired or if the equipment is not shut down
at the end of the year there may be multiple accidents such as Bhopal,
Chernobyl, and the Exxon Valdez, precisely at a time when telephones and
other services may be disrupted.</b>
<p><b>c) There are serious economic and political implications. Manufacturing
firms have thousands of suppliers. If only a few parts are unavailable,
assembly lines shut down. Suppliers who have fixed all of their equipment
thereby lose large customers. Hence, ripple effects can be significant.
Government services are also threatened. In October 1997 the Canadian Auditor
General issued a report saying that unless the pace of fixing code was
dramatically increased, the Canadian government would not be able to collect
taxes or make payments. State and local governments lag behind national
governments. Canada is ahead of most other countries in repairing its computer
equipment.</b>
<p><b>d) There may also be cultural effects. At the present time people
have faith in technology, progress, and government programmes. If technology
disrupts the current standard of living, if companies go bankrupt, and
if governments are unable to respond, faith in current institutions will
be undermined. [SU]</b>
<p><b>The Complexity of Y2K and Difficulties in the Division of Labour</b>
<p><b>Y2K is too big an issue for an individual to handle. Yet a division
of labour may create additional and unsuspected difficulties. Consider
the risks associated with nuclear power generation, for example. There
may well be failures in, for instance, cooling systems of nuclear facilities,
if we do not manage to upgrade them in time.</b>
<p><b>Working with my students last year in an economic simulation I designed,
we attempted an enactment of the issues in the following manner. Imagine
two groups (of students), one reporting to a student acting as the manager
of a nuclear power plant; while the other group reports to a student acting
as the manager of an enterprise selling Y2K security system upgrades. The
question becomes, will the representatives of the two groups agree on the
pricing of the upgrade if one side hopes for a bargain price while the
other is briefed to recover total cost? In our role play, my students could
not reach an agreement within an acceptable timeframe. That is, the upgrade,
though available, was not bought. The division of the task between different
labour groups did not help us arrive at a solution.</b>
<p><b>This non-representative warning might help us understand why I believe
it is useful to try unconventional ways to organize direct participation
around the Y2K Problem.</b>
<p><b>(I do this by suggesting an application of my rather formal research
on fractally superimposed maps in the special context of Y2K. This approach
can be found referenced on my web site:</b>
<p><b>http://www.schreiber.at/schreiber.</b>
<p><b>It is not included in this generalist piece because of its technical
nature.) [MS]</b>
<p><b>Y2K Seen as an Opportunity</b>
<p><b><u>What Universities might do to help</u></b>
<p><b>Y2K is a challenge to universities, given their roles in education,
research and public service.</b>
<p><b>So far the Y2K activities of universities have focused primarily
on fixing their internal equipment. However, the education, service, and
research functions of universities suggest a greater role for them. In
terms of education, the general public needs to understand the problems
that may arise and how to prepare. A great deal of community organizing
is needed in order to be sure that all members of society will be cared
for. Universities can render public service by providing occasions where
local utilities and emergency planning professionals can share information
with the public so that contingency plans focus on areas of greatest need.</b>
<p><b>Universities can provide meetings where people work through their
psychological reactions to Y2K. Those who have been active in the field
agree that people need to go through a series of stages in adjusting to
Y2K. The stages are similar to the stages described by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross
in her book Death and Dying, i.e. denial, anger, negotiation, and acceptance.
The dangers that Y2K presents are large and important, and the uncertainty
surrounding what will actually happen is far greater than the uncertainties
normally dealt with by corporate strategic planners. Y2K will affect people
in both their professional and private lives. Planning for Y2K requires
that we learn more about modern society than many people want to know.
A common coping strategy is to deny that the problem exists or that it
is serious. But this reaction increases the chances that the social consequences
will be more serious than they otherwise might need to be.</b>
<p><b>In terms of research, Y2K can be seen as an unprecedented opportunity.
For the next several months the interconnections within modern societies
will be revealed as never before. As systems break down, we shall learn
what other systems depend upon them. For social scientists interested in
action research, Y2K presents a unique opportunity to test theories and
methods. I suggest that social scientists be asked to predict what they
think will happen and why. These papers could be presented at a conference
in September 1999. At a second conference in April 2000 we could compare
the predictions with events. Furthermore, those engaged in efforts to increase
awareness and to prepare organizations could be asked to describe what
they did, why they chose the methods they chose, what they expected to
happen, and how their expectations were confirmed or refuted. Papers by
authors from different countries could be compared. My hypothesis is that
papers by Americans will be pragmatic and action oriented whereas papers
by continental Europeans will be more abstract or theoretical (Mueller,
1998). By taking an experimental approach to Y2K, we could greatly increase
our understanding of social systems.</b>
<p><b><u>What I Have Done</u></b>
<p><b>Since June 1997 when I read the article in Newsweek, The Day the
World Crashes, (Levy and Hafner, 1997) I have been working on the Y2K computer
crisis. As a professional academic I operate a listserv on Y2K for academic
colleagues in the U.S. and in other countries. I have built a website with
the aid of student assistants (www.gwu.edu/~Y2K). I have published articles
(Umpleby, 1998a and 1998b) and I have lectured on Y2K at conferences in
several countries. I have lobbied for attention to the issue within my
university and my neighbourhood community. With others I have organized
a series of panel discussions on Y2K beginning in March 1998. I have participated
in briefings for managers of government agencies, corporations, and associations.
Others associated with the Research Program in Social and Organizational
Learning have published books and newsletters and lectured and consulted
widely regarding Y2K. [SU]</b>
<p><b>Y2K and a New Approach to Working Together</b>
<p><b><u>A General Perspective</u></b>
<p><b>Let us start by defining a general perspective. We can conduct Y2K
discussions by the introduction and exclusion of risks through the combination
and separation of risks. We can try to simplify participative discussion
and action by providing tools to assess and handle selected portfolios
of such threats. In order to present a tool for this and other issues of
similar complexity, we focus here on the latter.</b>
<p><b><u>For Example, Y2K</u></b>
<p><b>Should I buy an oven to burn wood at home? Should I withdraw some
or all my money from my bank? Should I go to a foreign country? Will I
eat old bread for weeks if nothing happens in spite of my precautions?
Can I trust those technicians and managers who believe this is the end
of the world? Will I enhance my reputation by expecting Y2K troubles, or
by not expecting them.</b>
<p><b>We might brainstorm many additional potential issues connected to
Y2K. But we want to invite people to share co-operatively in facing the
problem, by visiting sites where we place distinct icons that refer to
these issues. This forces us to limit the number of distinctions we may
handle.</b>
<p><b>The web is as well suited as actual physical presence for this. We
can outline dimensions (for instance 6) of Y2K danger. Then we can imagine
how we might blend them into one scenario map (a matrix like a chessboard
in which possible combinations or danger are represented in the squares),
for real and netbased participation. And then we can play out combinations
and matrix locations to examine them, developing our understanding of them
as options within courses of action. (This is the material that may be
referenced on the web site <u>http://www.schreiber.at/schreiber</u>: see
above.) [MS]</b>
<p><b>Personal Actions and Precautions</b>
<p><b>People living in New Zealand are advised to prepare for geophysical
hazards. National and local Emergency Services preparations for the technological
hazards possible as a consequence of Y2K Problems are focused on responses
similar in time scale to those for geophysical hazards. In general, such
preparations are made for three day to one week event-responses. The major
theme in hazard preparedness is self reliance. A secondary but growing
concern is for the possible legal consequences of failure to meet contractual
or other obligations in relation to Y2K Problems. It is accepted that insurance
cover cannot meet the risk exposure since the event is known beforehand.
Because the Y2K is systemic in origin, stemming from the highly interrelated
and integrated nature of modern society, it is vulnerable to very small
failures in systems. The potentially widespread consequences have caused
me concerns over the magnitude and actual impact of computer systems failures
as events play out following the Millennium.</b>
<p><b>To that end I began mid 1997 to explore ways in which events could
play out more satisfactorily. It was very obvious that the more people
took Y2K issues seriously the less the threat to the community as a whole.
My own straw poll among local business people indicated knowledge of the
problem as early as 1997 but rates of progress that still had completion
dates well after 01/01/2000. I drew attention to the systemic nature of
Y2K Problems to a number of community organisations and, for my pains,
was co-opted on the Hamilton City Emergency Services Group Committee and
the University of Waikato Y2K Contingency Planning Group</b>
<p><b>In New Zealand, the Emergency Services (Police, Civil Defence, Fire
Brigade, Hospitals and Ambulance) are the key response organisations that
attend to failures of normal systems. It was my view that people in Hamilton
City needed to build onto existing knowledge appropriate actions that would
reduce their dependence on core utilities. Choosing alternate energy sources
and modifying water use could substantially reduce exposure to electricity
failure, by far the greatest community wide susceptible system. In a prior
water crisis when rationing was introduced, many Aucklanders bought water
tanks to trap rainwater from their roofs for domestic use. This, and similar
exposure reducing strategies have not been adopted by the City as a whole.
However, key Emergence Services are, as I write, buying generators. The
University of Waikato is in the process of evaluating the extent to which
an existing mini computer UPS generator can meet short-term energy needs
for data processing.</b>
<p><b>The greatest effort in the wider New Zealand community has been put
into mitigation strategies. These strategies have been applied directly
to the technology that may cause the problem: embedded chips and computer
systems such as desktop machines. The work was intended to remove the perceived
cause of risk exposure. The strategy here is to modify the event rather
than change the behaviour that caused the event in the first place. There
has been little serious planning, as at mid April 1999, into possible contingency
plans or reducing exposure by making changes in social organisations or
their expectations.</b>
<p><b>Individual responses to Y2K Problems are very difficult to gauge
because they are made in private and against strong social pressure to
adopt the engineering solution and fix the technological problem rather
than adjust human behaviour and expectations. It is fairly clear that the
social disruption of lost services and utilities could change the fabric
of society. Such changes would be felt first among the most vulnerable,
the young, the old, the housebound and the sick and the economically stressed.
For the dependent in society there is no choice but to accept what comes
along. Advising such folk to take steps now to prepare would not be productive
of anything other than seriously increasing their stress levels. It is
also clear that there are people who are placing wider global events, such
as the share market bubble, in a Y2K context and predicting an inevitable
correction. The key questions of when to sell up or sell short on the share
and commodity markets have entertained many pundits. There are no clear
answers but it is widely accepted that world share markets are vulnerable
and over-priced. Furthermore, many people are investing heavily in property
because interest rates are at historically low levels. Consequently indebtedness
levels are high in New Zealand, at almost the levels of America, Britain
and Ireland. The equity loss likely following a major share market correction
would have ripple effects throughout New Zealand society and economy.</b>
<p><b>These factors and other local and international events, such as the
Balkan debacle, point to a time of high uncertainty. At a community level
increasing self-reliance and reducing community dependencies seems a useful
strategy. My efforts are directed towards achieving these goals in the
community. At an individual level cashing up on debts and consolidating
equity in property also seems an appropriate hedge against uncertainty.
In times of high uncertainty people should be encouraged to adopt Pascal's
wager: if there is a choice (and there always is), choose the option the
outcome of which will affect you least. At a personal level, I have chosen
options the outcome of which I believe will affect me least. I am cashed
up. I have no debts. I don't use a credit card. I am in the process of
moving to a mortgage free rural home. What few assets I have are portable.
I have shed much of the superstructure and clutter of urban living. I have
done so because, for me, all the indications are that Y2K Problems either
directly or indirectly will bring about significant social disruption for
at least ten years in New Zealand. [BB]</b>
<p><b>________________________________________________</b>
<p><b>What can we do? You and I could try to protect our own interest by</b>
<p><b>a) leaving areas with nuclear infrastructures,</b>
<p><b>b) buying property and other non-commodities etc, or gold or platinum,</b>
<p><b>c) selecting a supposedly stable destination to be at,</b>
<p><b>d) buying food and drinks while preparing to burn wood,</b>
<p><b>e) staying away from crowds and mass transport,</b>
<p><b>f) doubting mass media and internet sources concerning Y2K.</b>
<p><b>But a strategy like this could actually contribute to the overall
complexity of Y2K. What if many others tried to move, divest etc? [MS]</b>
<p><b>________________________________________________</b>
<p><b>In my personal life I have made the following arrangements:</b>
<p><b>a) My finances are in a defensive posture.</b>
<p><b>b) My mother is receiving double prescriptions. We set aside half
for next year. Soon we shall go back to normal prescriptions.</b>
<p><b>c) We have bought a vacation home at a resort in the mountains. It
has a wood stove. I plan to have the family there for New Years. It is
not off the grid, so I have ordered a small generator, since the sewage
system requires electricity.</b>
<p><b>d) I have installed a wood stove in the basement in my home in the
city much more efficient than a fireplace. There is a cord of wood in the
garage. My elderly neighbour is not preparing. He has a key to my house
and is welcome to use it.</b>
<p><b>e) For several months I have been saving hard plastic fruit juice
and soft drink bottles for water storage.</b>
<p><b>f) We are gradually increasing the food in the pantry.</b>
<p><b>g) I have purchased an oil lamp and oil.</b>

how to prepare. Lord's book is good. I have heard that Hyatt's book is
good. [SU]</b>
<p><b>________________________________________________</b>

what to do with and for elderly relatives. What we have decided is this:</b>
<p><b>a) food etc: we are building a stock of food that can be eaten with
little or no cooking, and which can be heated easily (to give warmth in
winter). We are building a stock of mineral water and fruit juices. We
will fill our freezer at the end of the year, expecting that a power loss
will destroy the contents. We will stock 2 weeks supplies. We also have
a basic supply of drugs.</b>
<p><b>b) sanitation: we are installing a water butt to collect rainwater
from the roof (a step we should have taken long ago), and we are filling
empty bottles to give us non-drinking water.</b>
<p><b>c) heating, cooking and lighting: we have a gas heater for emergencies
and will order spare cylinders. We will also order cylinders for a camping
gas stove. We have a stock of candles and an oil lamp.</b>
<p><b>d) entertainment: I am considering how to entertain myself in a time
without electric light and power, and without heating. Bed seems a good
answer. Living by nature's clock another. I anticipate this will be an
interesting experience from which I will learn a lot and through which
I may become aware of — and adjust — various habits.</b>
<p><b>e) communication: we are becoming as connected as we can: phone,
fax, mobile, email (alternative service providers) and webmail. I shall
send details with my annual Christmas message. But I expect not to communicate
much until well into the new Millennium.</b>
<p><b>f) computing: since we run Macs, we don't have the Y2K Problem. It's
you PC people (and others) who have it! Nevertheless, I will back up our
network on old years day and will presume not to use computers much until
well into the new Millennium. I will also recommission old computers, just
in case. (This is an example that the problem stems from others.)</b>
<p><b>g) work: I am organising my work to be at home, and not to involve
computers. My wife has no such options.</b>
<p><b>h) travel: apart from my wife's commuting to work, we will not travel
except to see relatives and sick and elderly friends. I am doing my best
not to schedule any use of public (and especially air) transport until
well into March 2000.</b>
<p><b>i) finances: our assets are being moved to safe investments. We may
lose out, but it is nothing to what we might lose to vulnerable stocks
in an overvalued market. I specially do not like service providers of all
sorts, and high tech industries: they stand to lose too much in lost income
and claims against them. We will also arrange to have ready access to cash.</b>
<p><b>j) We will try not to leave our house unattended/unguarded.</b>
<p><b>k) My stockbroker advises keeping very careful records around the
Millennium. Since electronic records may go astray, it is important to
have reliable personal records. Banks, for instance, rarely admit they're
wrong. [RG]</b>
<p><b>Y2K and the Cybernetics Community</b>
<p><b>Y2K is a particularly suitable topic for cyberneticians and systems
scientists given their interests and unique skills. Below, I list the several
reasons why I believe Y2K is a particularly appropriate topic for the cybernetics
community to both study and act in.</b>
<p><b>a) It is important. People around the world will be affected (Marcoccio,
1999; Peterson, et al., 1998; Yourdon and Yourdon, 1997).</b>
<p><b>b) It is interdisciplinary. Thoroughly understanding Y2K requires
knowledge of technology, management, economics, politics, psychology, anthropology,
and of course systems theory and cybernetics.</b>
<p><b>c) It is the frame problem on a grand scale. The frame problem is
the second order problem of choosing the most appropriate conceptualization
of a problem. Here are two examples. As a first example, a software engineer
designs a payroll system and is very careful to correctly build in deductions
for taxes and the pension system. But he uses a two-digit date for the
year and the software malfunctions at the end of the century. This is the
frame problem in that his conceptualization of the task was incomplete.
As a second example, President Clinton in his January 1999 State of the
Union address said that Y2K is a big, big problem and that small businesses,
and state and local governments in particular need to be working on it.
However, later that week he and Al Gore, together with others in a panel
discussion on Medicare, proposed using some of the budget surplus to support
Medicare 15 years in the future. But the Y2K literature says that Medicare
will not be functioning a year from now due to software problems. This
is the frame problem in the form of lack of appropriate connections being
made in the mind. From now to the end of the year no decision should be
made without considering the context of Y2K.</b>
<p><b>d) Those who have worked on the Y2K computer crisis are intrigued
by issues of learning, adaptation, and participation in families, communities,
organizations, nations, and the world as a whole. Those who are interested
in cognition and are concerned about other people will find it a rewarding
topic to investigate. As a case study to engage students in systems thinking,
Y2K is unsurpassed. [SU]</b>
<p><b>What is interesting about the Y2K Problem, looked at dispassionately
as a subject for investigation, is that it is based in uncontrollability.
This may be thought of in terms of Ashby's &Ograve;Law of Requisite Variety&Oacute;,
about which I've written extensively in earlier issues of this Journal.
There are two aspects to this.</b>
<p><b>The problem lies in sheer the vastness and inaccessibility of the
information: it is not possible to even consider defining the states the
system of world computation might take, let alone to possible or actual
combinations. So the problem cannot be defined. But if it could be, there's
a fair chance it would be transcomputable. The strategy for dealing with
the vast complexity of local responsibility for control is only viable
when that responsibility is taken. See next paragraph.</b>
<p><b>The problem also lies not in what each of us (or each organisation
or government) does, but in what others do (or do not do, in the case of
Y2K). My compliance (as the term is) is useless without your compliance.
Therefore, control is beyond us, because we do not (in the case of Y2K,
cannot) control these others. This is why all the assertions of, for instance,
power companies cannot be taken to be reliable: they depend on others,
are not autonomous and uninfluenced by them. Unless everyone has performed
to the same standard of excellence, ie, there can be no guarantees. This
is the problem referred to above as that of taking local responsibility
for control.</b>
<p><b>Both of these leave us with one of the major challenges that faces
cybernetics. How to confront systems which are in essence, or should be
in order not to distort, beyond the realms of effective control. There
are many questions in here which we may benefit from by studying, some
of which I have already suggested in earlier columns. If we can face these
and arrive at solutions and strategies for action, cybernetics will make
a tremendous contribution to our ability to live in our world. It will
have become a science for effective organisation, as Stafford Beer has
told us it should be. [RG]</b>

asked about the generation of electricity. Incredulous, he wondered whether
I was mad! His company had not considered that anyone they depended upon
might not be Millennium compliant. [RG]</b>
