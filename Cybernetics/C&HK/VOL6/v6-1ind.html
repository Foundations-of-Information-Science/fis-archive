<br>by Soren Brier</center>

<p>As we were planning the present (sixth) volume of Cybernetics &amp;
Human Knowing news of the sad death of Niklas Luhmann reached us. It is
a great loss for the journal to lose such a prominent editor, contributor
and colleague.&nbsp;
<p>In the beginning of the 1990’s I was working with Fred Steier (who was,
at that time, president for the American Society for Cybernetics), on the
creation of what became Cybernetics and Human Knowing. Around that time
I read some of Luhmann’s work. I was fascinated by the way he brought the
concept of autopoiesis into the psychological and socio-communicative realms
by lifting the concept out of biology and generalizing it. Living systems
with any kind of conscious social communicative means were now seen as
composed of (at least) three different autopoietic systems: the biological,
the psychological and the socio-communicative. They are each closed to
each other and can only know each other through inter-penetration. This
way the concept of autopoiesis was developed beyond biological science.
Luhmann’s work was a fully-fledged trans-disciplinary theory using the
concepts of closure, eigen values and autopoiesis, combined with concepts
of information, meaning and selection plus a more developed basic philosophy.
Here was a unique combination of system theoretical, second order cybernetic
and autopoietical thinking in a cultivated mind with an impressive knowledge
about the Western philosophical, and philosophy of science, tradition.
The only thing I lacked was the sense for biology that you found in Bateson,
von Foerster, Maturana and Varela. But you cannot have it all! Later, of
course, we discussed whether it would be better to use the term organizational
closure on the psychological and socio-communicative level, in order not
to devaluate the original biological definition of autopoiesis. Nevertheless
it was a daring and very inspiring move from Luhmann.
<p>So I wrote to Luhmann, told him how important I considered his work
for the research program behind the journal and asked him to support the
journal with papers and to put his name on the editorial board. He kindly
said yes to both. His name first appears in the editorial board in vol.
1, no. 4. But even before that, in the journal’s first issue, Ole Thyssen
had written a paper drawing on Luhmann’s work. So in 1995 with Ole Thyssen
as guest editor we produced a special issue on Luhmann with an English
translation of one of Luhmann’s papers plus an interview with him as well
as an introductory paper by Thyssen himself and also a paper where he developed
Luhmann’s theory into the realm of morality in organizations (Vol. 3, no.
2). This has been one of our most widely read issues.
<p>It was a model explaining the limits of language in the psychological
realm and why the body still has its secrets for the pscyhe. Finally it
led to the use of the concepts of structural couplings and generalized
media in theories of social communication.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Luhmann was an original thinker, never afraid to be among the first
in an area breaking new ground. He willingly supported others who dared
follow after him into the new territory he had opened. I met Niklas Luhmann
personally at a seminar in Odense (Denmark) some years ago and was surprised
at the low key, gentle and kind appearance of this tremendously productive
and intellectually provocative writer. At Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing&nbsp;
we are very sorry to have to take Luhmann’s name off of the editorial board
list. But we hope, in 1999, to produce a special issue in his honor. The
theme will be on the relationship between second order cybernetics and
semiotics. Luhmann has written a most profound article on this subject.
It has recently been translated into English. We will publish this paper
in his honor and ask a semiotician to discuss its theories seen from ‘the
other side of the fence’.
<p>At our request Professor Dirk Becker has kindly stepped in to fill the
empty space on the editorial board.
<p>The present issue has a main section on radical constructivism in educational
studies of which Marie Larochelle is the guest editor. In addition to that
we have a praxis paper also related to education written by Joy Murray,
plus our columns by Lou Kauffman and Ranulph Glanville — the book reviews
have had to be postponed to a later issue. The artist in this isssue is
Lone Frydendal.
