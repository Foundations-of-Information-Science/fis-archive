<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Preliminaries</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Recently, two of the editor’s
graduate students, Maj-Britt Rosenkilde and Anja Abel S&oslash;rensen,
wrote to ask about my version of the beginnings of second order cybernetics.
Since the plans I had for this issue were to write a jointly authored column
with two applied linguists from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and the
plans didn’t work out—I had a change of schedule for personal reasons—this
request seemed fortunate, timely and apposite. (The jointly authored column
is still planned.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>A Testamony, Not A History</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>This is not so much history
as testamony. The whole point of Second Order Cybernetics is that it asserts
there is no observation without an observer. There is nothing spoken without
a speaker, there is no action without an actor.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>When I try to create my account
of the &quot;Gestation of Second Order Cybernetics&quot;, if I am to be
true to my subject I will not try to write the history, but a personal
history at most. My account is of my experience as a participant in this
event, and is particular: it is particular because my experience was particular.
It happened in a particular context, at a particular time and place. And
to a particular person.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I am not sure that I believe
it is consistent with the message of Second Order Cybernetics that history
should be attempted. Perhaps I am a little extreme in this, but that is
in my character. Anyhow, I am not the person to try to write that history
which will be the history. The focus of my account lies in the groups Gordan
Pask had around him: colleagues at System Research, students at Brunell
University, and peers - especially at the Biological Computer Laboratory
founded and directed by Heinz von Foerster.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Yes, one of the more interesting
aspects of this event was that it was enacted by people from such different
backgrounds and in such different places (what has become the internet
was only itself in early gestation at this time). It was widely (if thinly)
based. For the historian who may one day try to write the history, this
may be a matter of great interest.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I mention some of the many
others who were involved in this Gestation at the end. The reason I do
not refer more to their work is that they were not a part of my history.
The added advantage of this is that this leaves room for others to add
their own accounts. The editor confirms that he supports the invitation.
Please feel welcomed to contribute your own account. If there is to be
a history, let i be a history of these personal accounts.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>But this column is not really
a history. It is my testament.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>First Rumblings</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>&nbsp;I first became aware
that cybernetics was undergoing a sea change early on in my studies with
Gordon Pask, during the winter of 1971–2. Pask was then concerned with
what he called &quot;Task Structures&quot;, which eventually lead him to
develop Conversation Theory. Pask’s way of teaching, at that time, was
to rehearse in front of his class the context of the problem that was bothering
him that week, and then to introduce the problem to the class, inviting
our comments and attempts at solutions. It was a fine approach, and he
managed it wonderfully. <A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Pask introduced the question
first brought up by the great mathematician David Hilbert, and finally
disposed of by the legendary Kurt Goedel. This is a well-known question.
As I remember, Gordon brought the matter up in the following way.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Taking the notion of a system,
he wanted to introduce a meta-system that would model or describe that
system completely. (The reason for this concern grew out of his wish to
create complete descriptions of tasks, generalised to the complete descriptions
of knowledge.) According to Goedel (the generalised version of Goedel’s
finding, the original of which was actually limited to arithmetic), this
is an unattainable aim. We cannot know that we have a description that,
staying within a system is simultaneously both complete and consistent.<A HREF="#3">3</A>
So how could he achieve his impossible aim and make a &quot;perfect&quot;
model? How could he describe a structure of tasks, for instance, and have
confidence that the description would cover all eventualities and not lead
to conflicts: that is, be absolutely accurate and reliable.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Why would this matter? Because,
if you wish to control a system, the subtlety of your control is dependent
on the accuracy of the model. This is the meaning of Ashby’s notion of
variety and is borne out in the classic paper &quot;Every Good Regulator
of a System Must be a Model of that System&quot; he wrote with Roger Conant
and to which, for some reason I still do not understand, Gordon had a strong
aversion.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Furthermore, this was considered—and
to a large degree still is (see Roger Penrose’s &quot;The Emperor’s New
Clothes&quot;, for example)—the crucial question at the centre of philosophical
debates on the attainability of an Artificial Intelligence, a debate that
Gordon’s colleague at Brunel University, Frank George, was profoundly interested
in at this time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Pask presented the conventional
way in which we have dealt with problems such as this. We have used the
notion of cascading systems. If the meta-system (the model) could not be
accurate, could we add a further meta-meta-system that would deal with
the problem? After a bit the answer is obvious. Of course not: the problem
remains the same because there will always be another meta level to strap
onto the one we’ve just added. And so on. As you start adding meta’s you
progress ever further along an infinite regress. The completeness/consistency
problem does not, however, recede.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>As a way out, Pask cited a
paper by the Swedish Autologist, Lars Loefgren. Loefgren was one of a group
of academic visitors to Heinz von Foerster’s Biological Computer Laboratory
(BCL) at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. Others included
Humberto Maturana, Gotthard G&uuml;nther, Ross Ashby and Gordon himself—to
name but a few. Loefgren’s paper (&quot;An Axiomatic Explanation of Complete
Self-Reproduction&quot;) published in 1968, was presented by Gordon as
seminal, representing a change in approach to the problem of meta’s.<A HREF="#4">4</A>
It was probably more of an inspiration to Pask than a literal model.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The Pask gloss on/development
from Loefgren went more or less thus:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Consider a system and a meta-system,
which describes the system. As we know, the meta-system cannot describe
the system simultaneously both completely and consistently. Imagine, contrary
to what we have already discovered, that the meta-system’s description
is improved a bit. It is still not simultaneously both complete and consistent,
of course, but it is better. Imagine, again, that there is another improvement,
and then another. At some point the system and the meta-system might be
indistinguishable, although this may involve a virtually infinite regress.
That is, the meta-system may eventually come to simultaneously both completely
and consistently model all of the system. (This is, of course, a calculus-like
argument of limits and could be translated into a concatenation of meta’s.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>But how would this happen?
The obvious way is for the meta-system to improve and improve. That is,
for all the change to happen in the meta-system—but we know the problem
with this. Less obviously, the system might change towards the meta-system,
or both might change towards the each other. Gordon dragged each of these
possibilities out of us, the latter by means of a wonderful what if question:
what if the model of the model were actually the object modelled in the
first instance? How could that be? As I remember, this was what he was
discovering from Loefgren’s work—that each system could be seen as describing
the other, and there would have to be a &quot;core&quot; where these descriptions
function &quot;properly&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I don’t know if I can communicate
the astonishment and sense of revelation I experienced at this. The process
was exciting. The man was exciting and brilliant. But the ideas, the ideas
were pure magic. Suddenly there was a world sucking me in, where ideas
could be played with, developed and turned in on themselves in wondrous
ways. For me it was a (long) moment of sudden passionate clarity, and of
transcendence and release.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>In brief, what we were discovering,
in class, was this:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>That there could be circular
systems taking a less &quot;disguised&quot; form than the feedback loop.
(By this I mean that a feedback loop is seen as taking very little energy,
and therefore is in some sense secondary, even peripheral. But in second
order cybernetics, which is no longer primarily concerned with and based
in a world of energetics, circularity and all its complications do not
have to be excused or evaded. They are the stuff of it.) That it is possible
to think of coupled systems each of which models the other. That stability
may be due to internal conditions and not to the relationship to an external
goal. (Indeed, a stable system might seem from outside to move very fast,
even chaotically.) That the view of a system from inside and the view from
outside must be considered of different (Russellian) types.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>(It was these notions that
had set me off on the handed universe I outlined in the last issue, a universe
that had a metaphorical hand on its boundary to grab the external observer
(and anything else) and pull it into the universe itself, so it always
contained its most recent observer/observation and was always complete.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>We Are Not Alone</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Imagine, then, my astonishment
and delight when two legendary figures turned up for our class one day
in the spring of 1973. I say legendary, but that was to those better versed
that I was. To me, they were just two visitors some of my fellow students
were getting very excited about. On their way back from a Piaget celebration
in France, they were Heinz von Foerster and Humberto Maturana (who had
been working with colleagues Francisco Varela and the unaccountably under-recognised
Ricardo Uribe). And both of them had exciting things to tell us about new
developments in their research. <A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Von Foerster spoke first. He
presented work that is summarised in his &quot;Notes on an Epistemology
for Living Things&quot;. This paper had two meanings for me that day. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The first was that a circular
argument could be sustained and yet, taking part in it, I could be moved
(in both senses). The argument concerned the inclusion of the observer
(an old problem in human and social sciences, but, equally, in physics)
and the nature of the knowledge thus produced: it pursued the assertion
that what we do is observing, not observing some thing, which Heinz had
made in his slightly earlier paper &quot;On Constructing a Reality&quot;.
He showed that there was a process by which, going through a series of
steps, you would return to where you had started from, but with a far greater
and deeper understanding. Observing is recursive, each loop including and
being based on the one before. It was like the saying of DT Suzuki, doyen
of teachers of zen in the west, quoted by the composer John Cage:</FONT></FONT></P>

<DIR>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Before studying zen, men are men and mountains
are mountains.<BR>
While studying zen all is confused.<BR>
After studying zen, men are men and mountains are mountains.<BR>
The difference is, that in the first case, the feet were a little bit off
the ground.<FONT SIZE=+0>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIR>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The second was that what he
was saying and the way he was saying it mapped onto each other as I believed
(and still do) the form and the content of works of art do: the form indicated
the content, the content required the form.<A HREF="#6">6</A> His argument
went round, repeating from the same start/end point. Coming from a background
in architecture and music, this meant a lot to me (and still does: cybernetics
is my art).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>At the time, Maturana’s presentation
was, if anything, even more impressive. I wish I could recreate it. It
was a big bamboozle: a magic. I remember it—and me—being spun in the way
he spoke. He used the word &quot;concatenation&quot;, a word I’d never
heard before and spoken in that special intonation of his, and it went
round and round in my head, a sort of incantational chorus: the concatenation
of concatenations…etc. <A HREF="#7">7</A></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>What he was talking about was
&quot;Autopoiesis&quot;. This was about as early as anyone had heard of
this concept, in public. Of course, Gordon knew it: he, Maturana and von
Foerster were in frequent contact. And what Maturana was saying, at that
time, was that life is the process of producing life (ie, is a verb, not
a noun). He talked about how a system that was self sustaining through
process could come into being: it produced itself and then continued to
produce itself of itself. He talked of studying the process of living not
by killing it, but as something that only had coherence as a process. In
my shorthand, he talked of life not in the death of vitrio, but as (the
process of) living.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>It became clear that what we
had been discussing and developing in Gordon’s classes was not isolated
or unique. That out there in the world of the superstars (our own teacher,
because he was our teacher, we mistakenly did not recognise as a superstar)
there were serious and major people who shared our concerns: with circularity;
with problems of completeness (how could the autopoietic system contain
its own self-description). Indeed, how—theoretically—can any genetically
driven system contain its own self description, which it must so that it
can reproduce itself, as it so manifestly does.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I don’t think Heinz used the
forms of words &quot;cybernetics of cybernetics&quot; or &quot;second order
cybernetics&quot; that day, but for me that was when I realised that the
world had changed, there was a new insight and a new interpretation: what,
I suppose, Kuhn would call a paradigm shift. That day I recognised what
later became known under the sobriquets:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">&quot;cybernetics of cybernetics&quot;, &quot;second
order cybernetics&quot; and the &quot;new cybernetics&quot;.</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Characteristics</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P>So what are the characteristics<A HREF="#8">8</A> of this version of
cybernetics?<A HREF="#9">9</A> It may appear surprising, after all the
fuss I made above, that Goedel’s problem is not at the heart of it. Goedel’s
problem was one of the drivers that lead to it, but the cybernetics of
cybernetics transcends it and relegates it to a corner because it belongs
to the class of phenomena that, while logically impossible, actually seems
to happen. My position is that we must therefore change logic, not what
we find to be actual.</P>

<P>The crucial characteristics that have been understood include the following:</P>

<DIR>
<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">The observer is included in the system (famously,
von Foerster’s aphorism in his amazing source book which gave us the name
&quot;The Cybernetics of Cybernetics&quot; is &quot;the cybernetics of
observing, not observed, systems&quot;). Unless the observer is included,
there is no observing. All knowing presumes the active participation of
an observer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Systems are seen as circular. Circularity
is taken to be the general case. Cutting circularity leads to hierarchy
and suchlike, ie to chains and cause. A metaphor is a wheel and its trace/track.
In other words, the circular form of feedback is taken seriously and is
not dismissed as a minor physical variant acceptable only because the energy
required is insignificant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Thus, the preoccupation is with process rather
than object. Objects become apparently stable embodiments of their own
(internal) processes (hence self-description), ie autonomous. And the difference
between internal and external (within the system and without it, particularly
vis-&agrave;-vis the observer) is appreciated, especially in relation to
stability. Descriptions made from outside may lead to an apparent object-ness,
but that object-ness comes from the act of observing. This also influences
how we can understand the notion of goal, so central in early cybernetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Herein lies the interest in that most diabolical
of local arrangements, self-reference. In a universe of reference, stable
entities (objects) must be taken as referring to themselves, if they are
to be taken to be autonomous objects in this universe and to be based in
reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Under such circumstances, communication (exchange)
is possible, but only if we abandon the lexicographical concepts of meaning
encoded in word, of rightness in communication, and allow instead negotiation
through conversation, which is a circular form. This &quot;means&quot;
that no one’s meanings are the same as any other’s. Within such a conversation,
all entities must be considered to be circular, as the conversation is,
for all knowledge of them is of them in and through circularities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Under these circumstances, notions such as
sameness and difference, identity, and the origins of logic require reinterpretation.
In fact, there is a whole universe of concepts to be thought through again.
<A HREF="#10">10</A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)">Second order cybernetics is constructivist.
It always talks of how the observer sees. But it is not without values:
there are still &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; views: argument
has value.<FONT SIZE=+0>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIR>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Behind these characteristics
lies a notion of distinction. Pask and von Foerster discovered, as the
sea change was in progress, an extraordinary text that seemed to transcend
the conventions of logical discourse and give rise to dramatic and beautiful
new ways of accounting for the world. The text, by a neighbour and acquaintance
of Gordon’s, became central to all of us involved, whether in the intricacies
of its mechanisms of logical manipulation or the rallying call &quot;Draw
a Distinction&quot; with which the argument begins (and which von Foerster
used as the abstract of his paper &quot;On Constructing a Reality&quot;).<A HREF="#11">11</A></FONT>
T<FONT SIZE=+0>his text was the &quot;Laws of Form&quot;, its author the
mathematician and logician George Spencer Brown. It was privately published
in 1968, the same year as Loefgren’s paper with which I began this account.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Sometimes I am asked what is
the value of this way of describing the world we construct and thus find
ourselves in. My answer is often taken to be odd. Most expect some comment
about its usefulness, or, perhaps, its truth. But for me what matters,
what talks to and moves me, is its staggering beauty. The fact that we
have become unused to talking of the products of our thinking in such terms
is, to me, a tragedy. Nevertheless, it is, part of the triumph of second
order cybernetics that it permits and even encourages this sort of comment
and valuation, and that I can say this, honestly, without fear of ridicule.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>A Personal Contribution</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>At this point I have also to
talk a little, and I hope not immodestly, about my work, for that was a
major element in the brief set me by Maj-Britt and Anja.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I have already mentioned the
handed universe. This serves more as an indicator of involvement than a
serious contribution.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>So how, then, do I see my contribution?
I will try to fit it in to the picture I have painted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Firstly, I (with many others)
was actively involved in the debate—in the Pask corner. I have already
explained that I think Gordon’s contribution was the result not only of
his individual creativity and genius, but was also a collective effort
in which his colleagues and students took part, questioning and arguing.
Many of the points I heard argued with Gordon in class were accepted by
him immediately. Others eventually made it; for instance, the insistence
that the number of distinctions drawn over what he called topics was indefinitely
large rather than, as he at first insisted, infinite (this reflects a difference
in how you conceive of the relationship between observer and observed).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Secondly, my main personal
contribution was to examine what sort of structure we would have to assume
when we believe that we all observe distinctly (differently), yet believe
we can talk as if we observe the same (Object: to use my technical term,
indicated with a capital initial O). I began this in my PhD, unofficially
called &quot;The Object of Objects; the Point of Points—or, Something about
Things&quot;, which was rejected at first because of this title! The gist
of the argument was that if we inhabit a universe of observation, of knowables,
then if we believe some Object exists so that we can observe it, we must
assume it observes its self. (This assumes that exist and know map, and
that we are talking as if the Object existed beforehand and outside of
our observing so that we could observe it: an assumption I have recently
revisited in the paper &quot;Acts Between and Between Acts&quot;.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The structure I developed is
self-observing and therefore circular and thoroughly cybernetic. The structure
also generates many interesting qualities such as a relational logic based
in times of observation and can, for instance account for memory, representation
and consciousness. See &quot;What is Memory.&quot;, &quot;All Thoughts
of Things&quot;, &quot;Consciousness, and soon&quot; and &quot;The same
is Different&quot; All done with an immensely simple calculus (its simplicity
continues to astonish me) that the external examiner, Heinz von Foerster,
at the time asserted was the calculus of Piaget’s notions of child development.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The other special value of
this work is its generality. It is so abstracted that it is capable of
providing a framework within which the other forms belonging to and originating
second order cybernetics can co-exist, a background against which they
can be viewed. Since it is designed to permit different viewpoints, this
is hardly surprising. It even accommodates and predicates Spencer Brown’s
dictum (&quot;The Self and the Other…&quot; is a recent, modified exploration).
It is a true product of that unsung hero whose thoughts are precursor to
second order cybernetics, the educator Fredrich Froebel (yes, I went to
a Froebel Kindergarten). Gordon Pask used, with the typical generosity
that marked the man, to say that there was an isomorphisms between this
&quot;Theory of Objects&quot; and all the other second order cybernetic
theories, but that the &quot;Theory of Objects&quot; was simpler, and more
elegant.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I am still finding out about
this work—what it means to me—and understanding the implications and subtleties
that I had no idea of when I developed it. (Ernst von Glasersfeld picked
this up immediately and challenged me in a way I found at the time incomprehensible
but now value for the impetus it gave me.) It is this impetus, and the
desire to reduce, simplify and eventually totally clear (back to the zen
state) that is what makes the notion of &quot;Mechanical Trees&quot; &quot;that
grow to their full height/and chop themselves down&quot; (Laurie Anderson)
so insistently appealing to me. I have to admit I still love and am surprised
by that work, work that I look at as a parent looks at a child, wondering
how on earth they even had anything to do with making it. To me, it is
the work that gives space for the work of others in the field: in a manner,
it gives permission. It is the generalisation of observer dependent systems—which,
in today’s understanding, means all systems.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Who’s Who</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Pask always talked of von Foerster
as his mentor, and, indeed, his dying efforts went into producing a paper
for von Foerster’s festschrift. Maturana and von Foerster were and still
are very close. Von Foerster talks of his admiration for and feeling of
closeness to Maturana. Part of the closeness had to do with the tragic
story of Chile. Maturana, Varela and Uribe were Chilean. The time we are
considering coincides with the time just after the CIA murdered Salvatore
Allende, the world’s first freely elected communist president, and installed
yet more authoritarian and right wing South American Generals in his place.
There was a connection between the cybernetics community and Chile. It
took two forms.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The first was the specific
involvement of Maturana, Varela and Uribe. They developed Autopoiesis,
they were Chilean, and it was necessary to extract them in the aftermath
of the CIA coup, for they were seen as revolutionaries and a threat. Consequently,
they were liable to be disappeared. One day, this story will be written,
and the efforts of and personal risks taken by von Foerster, Stafford Beer
and Pask (amongst others) will also become clearer.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>The second lies in Stafford
Beer, himself. I have not discussed his significant contribution because
it was not a part of my experience. Others will, I hope, make up for this.
Allende invited Stafford, as a sympathetic and serious manager (a cybernetician)
to help him develop the new Chile. Stafford’s work is almost entirely about
the inclusion of the observer within the observations made, and how this
can lead to effective actions (his definition of cybernetics). He was well
aware of the Chileans’ work on Autopoiesis. But he had another role. As
a major advisor to Allende, he developed concepts of real time information,
effective think tanks etc and brought them &quot;rough&quot; information,
quickly and through these means a degree of connection with the people,
which involved and interacted with the senior politicians in Allende’s
Government.<A HREF="#12">12</A></FONT> <FONT SIZE=+0>These were the other
people who had to be extracted from Chile. They included Finance Minister
Fernando Flores, whose more recent work with Terry Winograd is well known

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>This account is selective.
It is personal, it is my account of my discovery of second order cybernetics.
Certainly, those who populate my version are not the only ones who might
be cited. Some would want to emphasise the contributions of Stafford Beer
and of Ernst von Glasersfeld. Others would point to a German School, with
Gotthard G&uuml;nther and Niklas Luhmann, or to members of the Dutch Systems
Group. Francisco Varela would insist on a French presence with DuPuy and
his colleagues in Paris. Many would find precursors in Ross Ashby and Gregory
Bateson. And there will be others I have left out even of this list. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Perhaps some of those critics
and others would like to add to this account. To enrich it with further
accounts and references, and populate it with other people. As noted earlier,
the editor and I would be glad to receive any such offerings, and to co-ordinate
their assembly, perhaps into another column in this series.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>Postscript</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>I once asked Gordon, the only
person I knew intimately who had known Wiener well, what Wiener would have
thought of second order cybernetics. Would he have felt betrayed? Without
a second’s hesitation, Gordon insisted he would not. Gordon said that Wiener
knew full well that the ideas the early cyberneticians introduced were
only the beginning. That they knew the ideas had to be developed much further,
that they would have consequences that were even more radical when they
were examined in depth in the fullness of time, but that they didn’t know
how to do this themselves. Gordon told me Wiener would have been delighted
and excited. And that is the reason I have never felt the need to look
back, apologise, or to ask whether, in my pursuit of second order cybernetics,
I am undermining the first order, acting with arrogant insensitivity and
lack of respect, and destroying the subject that is my discipline.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>In the title, I give the dates
for the gestation of second order cybernetics as 1968 to 1975. Why? Because
1968 saw the appearance of Spencer Brown’s &quot;The Laws of Form&quot;
(the privately published first edition) and Loefgren’s paper. And 1975
saw Pask’s Conversation Theory books published, and Autopoiesis had finally
already found a publisher. And in 1975 I graduated, my PhD accepted.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="2"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>2 This is why,
in my recent web piece on Pask (see under &quot;Luminaries&quot; at www.isss.org)
I referred to the contribution of his students amongst the collaborators
who had contributed to the creation of Conversation Theory.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="3"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>3 Goedel's
Theorem is difficult even for logicians. There are some simple introductions,
however. For instance, Nagel and Newman's &quot;Goedel's Theorem&quot;
and the appropriate section of Andrew Hodges' book on Alan Turing, &quot;The
Enigma of Intelligence&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="4"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>4 I am not
sure that Loefgren agrees with this interpretation of his work.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="5"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>5 Another,
more competent person will one day explain the origins of this work of
both von Foerster and Maturana et al in studies of the neurology of cognition
and consciousness, and will point to the significance of the contributions
of Warren McCulloch (whom von Foerster claims as his mentor), Walter Pitts
and Jerome Letvin (with whom a youthful Maturana collaborated) all of whom
worked at MIT and had early connections with the Cybernetics Group (see
Steve Joshua Heims' book of that title).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="6"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>6 As I argued
in the Festschrift I edited in his honour-see Systems Research Vol. 10,
No 3, 1993.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="7"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>7 I believe
there is something about cybernetics that gives its practitioners this
ability. I remember, on first meeting Pask, being astounded, and considering
that though the man was obviously a genius, the subject must also have
played a major part in his abilities. Now that I have students voicing
similar opinions, I am more than ever convinced of the power of the subject.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="8"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>8 I would prefer
the word qualities. Qualities are attributed by an observer to an object
(or, more exactly, to an observation). Characteristics are taken to be
of an object. Turing clearly understood this in his classic paper on AI
which invented the Turing test, which makes spurious and superfluous the
Goedel type arguments in AI: intelligence is not a characteristic belonging
to an object (a property of that object): it is a quality attributed through
observing.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="9"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>9 Although
the differentiation of second order cybernetics from first was important
at the time, I am now inclined to drop the wording of the differentiation.
For me there is no conceivable cybernetics that does not benefit from the
developments of second order cybernetics: those insights were what cybernetics
was waiting for to reach maturity. So to talk of cybernetics without assuming
these discoveries is, in my view, not to talk of cybernetics at all.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="10"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>10 This is
what I try to do in my research, and constitutes my continuing research
programme.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="11"></A><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1)"><FONT SIZE=+0>11 Francisco
Varela worked on various extensions and elaborations of this text for several
years, especially as it affected self-reference. I have written about its
assumptions.</FONT></FONT></P>
