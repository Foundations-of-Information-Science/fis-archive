<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="arial"><FONT COLOR="#0080C0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Review
of Ervin Laszlo: <I>Whispering Pond</I></FONT></FONT></FONT></H3>

<CENTER><P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Element Books
1996, 242 pages</FONT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times"><FONT SIZE=+1>Axel

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The reading of Laszlo's
book has been fascinating to me, both when I read it first time and second
time, and now I know it almost by heart. It is a grand tour of modern science,
clearly divided into four parts dealing respectively with the more established
observations and theories, the problems with these views, the latest developments
to overcome these problems and finally an anticipatory vision of future
developments. With this division and with his way of writing the author
succeeds in presenting both well founded views and imaginative thinking
and doing it in such a way that the reader can avoid confounding the two.
The most cherished idea of Laszlo is that of universal interconnection,
which is expressed already by the title of the book as illustrated by the
cover picture showing interconnected waves on a pond seeming to whisper
about wider horizons. This interconnection is thought to comprise both
the cosmological, the physical, the biological and the mental domain, and
it includes interconnection between subject and object, man and environment,
in agreement with the unbreakable relation between observer and observed
assumed by second order cybernetics. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In the first part of the
book the author presents a readable and, as far as I can see, a mainly
correct exposition of the contemporary views of science in the domains
of cosmology, physics, life sciences and studies of the mind. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In the section on physics
Laszlo makes some points about quantum physics, where I have comments.
Thus I do not regard the wave-particle duality as a part of nature but
rather as a part of the standard theory of quantum physics. Other theories,
such as Bohm's theory (described by Laszlo later in the book, p.139) do
not contain this duality (Bohm, 1980; Feynman, 1985). This is an example
of the general rule in science that two or more theories may cover the
same set of observations, so that certain supposed entities or processes
may &quot;exist&quot; in one theory only, but not in others (Burling, 1964;
Randrup, 1997). Another example of this is found later in Laszlo's book
(p.71) where in relation to the famous two-slit experiment he asks &quot;could
it be that the photons, emitted as individual particles, interfere with
each other as waves ?&quot;. This is an interesting thought, but I would
emphasize that it is an alternative to the standard theory of quantum physics
which maintain that the wave aspect of each photon interferes with itself.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">I have speculated if the
supposed entanglement, or in Laszlo's words &quot;mysterious interconnection&quot;,
between quantum particles may also be replaced by other assumptions in
future theories. This entanglement is important for Laszlo, since it agrees
with his general view of universal interconnection, and he reports (pp.
72-73) some new calculations made in 1995 which will probably be important
for the further discussion of the entanglement problem. Here it may be
mentioned as one of the virtues of Laszlo's book that he has made a serious
effort to incorporate recent findings and theories of science. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Laszlo also reports the
discussions on the foundations or interpretations of quantum physics still
going on, and mentions that some physicists have speculated that the physical
world is &quot;mental rather than material&quot;. He also quotes the physicist
Wigner for saying that modern quantum physics had to content itself with
dealing with &quot;observations&quot; rather than &quot;observables&quot;.
Personally I agree with these mentalistic views (Randrup, 1997a) but Laszlo
is more doubtful and concludes (p.32) that today physical science has not
given an unambiguous answer to the question , &quot;What is matter ?&quot;.
Later in the book, in a more imaginative part (p. 207), he favors the view
that matter and mind are both real but they are not fundamental; they evolved
together out of a still deeper level of reality, which in itself is neither
mental nor material. This view he calls evolutionism. The deeper level
of reality referred to is identified with the zero-point energy field of
the cosmic quantum vacuum, which is also seen as an important bearer of
the universal interconnection, that is so central for Laszlo's thinking.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In the section on problems
in the study of mind Laszlo devotes some pages (103-114) to the phenomena
known as telepathy, clairvoyance etc. Since these phenomena are about connections
between human individuals or between humans and things, they are relevant
for Laszlo's favored view of general universal interconnection. The validity
of the evidence in this field has been disputed, but Laszlo seems to accept
the inclusion of the best of this evidence in what may be called the catalog
of acknowledged scientific observations, and here I tend to side with him.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Some of the telepathic
evidence related by Laszlo is about transference of EEG rhythms from one
person to another, although the two persons were rigorously separated by
walls, electrical shield etc. In this case it may be maintained that the
connection was between the brains of the two persons, i.e. between material
objects and not involving the mind. Here it should, however, be remembered
that Laszlo suggests that these connections are mediated by the quantum
vacuum energy field. The concept of this field has emerged from physics
and it is therefore generally regarded as material, but as related above,
in more imaginative parts of the book Laszlo extends the conception of
this field suggesting that it constitutes a deeper layer of reality which
in itself is neither mental nor material. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Although Laszlo's approach
is mainly scientific, he writes with understanding about mysticism and
spirituality, and he emphasizes that the developing notions of coherence
and unity in science, which he finds so important, bring science closer
to opinions held by mystics through the ages. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Still, it may be in place
to warn against what has been called &quot;spiritual materialism&quot;,
the attempt to understand the spiritual or mystic domain by means of empiry
and reason and to master it by means of special meditative and other techniques.
In opposition to spiritual materialism it has been said that in spite of
the developing and remarkable reconciliation between science and spirituality,
the latter is not something to be known intellectually or fully reached
by certain techniques, but rather by prolonged, living contact. Spirituality
may be seen as a way of knowing, thus also as a perspective on reason (Flier,
1995; Toegel 1991, on spiritual materialism pp. 170-243; Pierre Marchais,
personal communications). </FONT></P>
