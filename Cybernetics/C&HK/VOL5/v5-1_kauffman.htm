<CENTER><P><B><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+1>By
Louis H. Kauffman</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>This is the fourth
column in this series on “Virtual Logic”. This time I will discuss the
calculus of indications of G. Spencer-Brown as it is constructed in his
book “Laws of Form” [1]. For an excellent (albeit self-referential - the
author, James Keys, of “Only Two Can Play This Game” is Spencer-Brown himself)
review of Laws of Form, see [2]. Spencer-Brown’s book is based on the notion
of a distinction, and the consequences of what there would be if there
could be a distinction. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>It is possible
to proceed very simply from the notion of a single distinction and to reconstruct
in a most uncanny fashion the foundations of mathematics and the patterns
that lie at the bottom of any communication at all. It is, however, very
difficult to proceed simply. In order to do so it is necessary to put aside
all sorts of notions, fantasies and stories that we tell. In the process
of the telling we hypnotize ourselves into believing as real the very worlds
that are our own constructions. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>In order to proceed
in the most economical way, I will tell you a story. But you must be forewarned
that after I have told this story and we have all understood it, then it
is necessary to throw away the story and live in a simpler world. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>This column is
divided into two parts beyond this introduction: Story and Dialogue. Dialogue
is intended to complement Story and to place it in context - a number of
contexts. Story is itself very condensed and may require rereading to be
appreciated. Our intent is to explore a number of themes that are related
to simplicity and vanishing. As things nearly vanish, we reach regions
where apparently distinct domains touch, join and become one. As things
come into being, apparently distinct domains appear from an undifferentiated
ground. These new domains grow in great profusion and prolixity, sometimes
obscuring the simple origins. We are interested in creative growth. It
is by returning to the origin that the source of such newness is found.
The calculus of indications is a gem retrieved by a descent into nothingness.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0><B>I. Story</B>
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Imagine a distinction.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Let this distinction
be denoted by the curly brackets shown below. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>{ } </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>By our already
agreed upon conventions </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>(we cannot proceed
without them) </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>(where did we
get them?) </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>we understand
that the distinction produced by the curly brackets consists of an inside
enclosed by the brackets and an outside that lies beyond the brackets.
Let us denote the inside of the brackets by I and the outside by O. Let
us place the letters I and O on the inside and the outside of the brackets
as shown below. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>{ I } O </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Our original
curly distinction is now decorated with names, and we can use these names
as points of reference to speak of journeys from one side to the other.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Let there be
an operator called sharp bracket denoted by </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt; &gt; </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>that indicates
the passage from one side of the distinction to the other side. Thus &lt;I&gt;
= O is an equation in the sharp operator that says “If you cross from the
inside then you are outside.” And &lt;O&gt; = I says that if you cross
from the outside, then you are inside. Now we have all sorts of things
- names for inside and outside, operators that mediate the crossings from
inside to outside, notations for the operator, depiction’s of the original
distinction. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>You could begin
to do mathematics with all of this. The operator itself looks like the
negation operator NOT in logic: NOT inside is outside. NOT outside is inside.
NOT NOT outside is outside. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>NOT NOT inside
is inside. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt;&lt;O&gt;&gt;
= &lt;I&gt; = O. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt;
= &lt;O&gt; = I. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>NOT X &lt;——-&gt;
&lt;X&gt;. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>NOT NOT X = X
&lt;——-&gt; &lt;&lt;X&gt;&gt;= X. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Yes indeed. This
is a familiar world. And in this world, we are inclined to wonder where
in the “actual” world is this miraculous operator NOT that can undo itself
in a blink? Ludwig Wittgenstein in his “Tractatus Logico Philosophicus”
[3] wondered (Tractatus - Statement 5.511) “How can logic - all embracing
logic, which mirrors the world, use such peculiar crochets and contrivances?
Only because they are all connected with one another in an infinitely fine
network, the great mirror.” </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The blindness
has already begun to set in. A world of description and a world of actuality
are beginning to distinguish themselves. Yet here, we can see that the
world of description is actually more complex than the simple distinction
that it describes! (Perhaps you would not swear to that in your entrancement.)
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>We shall simplify.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>We shall simplify
by releasing terms and indicators until the language and the world it describes
are coincident. Parallel lines may not have to wait until infinity before
they meet. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Let go of I.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Identify the
inside of the distinction by the absence of a name. In speaking about it
we shall say that the inside is unmarked. The inside is the unmarked state
of the distinction. The outside is the marked state of the distinction.
Since markedness is distinct from unmarkedness, the two sides of the distinction
are distinguished from one another by dint of their respective properties.
One side is marked. The other side is not marked. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The equations
of operation simplify from </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt;I&gt; = O
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt;O&gt;= I
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>to </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt; &gt; =O
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt;O&gt;= .
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>In this second
form, the first equation reads that the crossing from the (literally!)
unmarked state yields the outside (marked) state. The second equation says
that the passage from the marked (outside) state yields the unmarked state.
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The distinction
itself is now decorated only with an O on its outside and nothing on its
inside. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>{ } O </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Mirabile dictu,
the new equations suggest a further simplification! For the equation &lt;
&gt; = O suggests that we can do away with the name of the outside, replacing
it with the empty operator symbol: &lt; &gt;. After all, &lt; &gt; denotes
the state obtained by crossing from the unmarked state and this is indeed
the outside, the marked state. Making this second descent, we find new
equations. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt; &gt; = &lt;
&gt; </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
= . </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The first equation
reads “The value obtained upon crossing from the unmarked state (the inside
of the sharp bracket is unmarked) is the marked state (indicated directly
by the sharp bracket).” The second equation reads “The value obtained upon
crossing from the marked state is the unmarked state.” </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The distinction
is now decorated only with sharp brackets, indicating the marked state,
on its outside. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>{ } &lt;&gt;
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>These two descents
have brought us into a remarkable coincidence of name and operation. The
sign &lt; &gt; is the name of the marked state. The sign &lt; &gt; is result
of the act of crossing from the unmarked state. The symbol &lt;X&gt; denotes
the state obtained by crossing from the state indicated on its inside.
Name and act have condensed. The name is nothing but the act of crossing
from the absence of name. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>And yet we have
not yet reached the bottom of the singularity. The symbol sharp bracket
is itself a distinction and indeed a distinction between inside and outside,
as we have been speaking it for the last two descents. We no longer need
the curly brackets! Let &lt; &gt; itself be the first distinction. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Replace { } by
&lt; &gt;. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Then &lt; &gt;
is decorated on its outside by a copy of itself. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>{ } &lt; &gt;
&lt;——-&gt; &lt; &gt; &lt; &gt; </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>This is redundant.
One copy of the distinction is sufficient for identification. (Professor
Wittgenstein is himself with or without his name tag.) </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Thus we can write
&lt; &gt; &lt; &gt; = &lt; &gt;, simplifying the distinction plus name
to the distinction itself. The name is the thing named. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Finally, we arrive
at the two fundamental equations of the calculus of indications. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>1. &lt; &gt;
&lt; &gt; = &lt; &gt; </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The value of
a call made again is the value of the call. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>2. &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
= </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>The value of
a crossing made again is not the value of the crossing. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>From here we
see that there is no great mirror. The world and the description of the
world are one. The observer is the mark. Our excursions into ever-spiraling
description and discovery follow inexorably from what a distinction would
be if it could be at all. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>That a distinction
cannot be is the last stage of the descent. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0><B>II. Dialogue</B>
</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>This section
is in the form of a dialogue. The two voices in the dialogue are named
Jeremy and Lou. They will alternate from paragraph to paragraph. Lou is
the author of Story. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - Wait
one minute Lou. You just ended this story with the suggestion that there
cannot be a distinction. Haven’t we just been looking at a primary distinction
and its properties? </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - Really
I mean that a distinction is a kind of fiction, or story that we tell.
It has exactly the existential quality of any good fictional entity. Take
Sherlock Holmes. Once he came into existence, he had always been and he
always would be. On the other hand, if you try to make a fiction into an
actuality there will be limitations and the absence of a good fit. Mathematical
entities like numbers exist in the mathematical world and have very exact
properties there. This mathematical world is a fictional world. The patterns
of the mathematical world are, however, found in our experience. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - It seems
to me that you are being quite paradoxical here. In your Story you intimate
that there is no difference among actuality, our experience and our models
of our experience. Is our experience then only a fiction? </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - Precisely!
Our experience is a fiction, and the mathematical part of that fiction
is the most solid and long-lasting aspect of it. Mathematical entities
change very little in time, and the more you look at them the more you
learn about them. The exemplar of both our experience and our models is
the experience of a distinction. A distinction is always an experience
of distinction for some one. This brings us, as usual, to second order
cybernetics where the only systems that really exist are systems that are
observers. An aware system is a system that transcends boundaries. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - My world
is real. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - I do not
deny the reality of your world or mine. I only say that what you have of
that world is your story of it. The story, being a good story, appears
to have inevitability and immutability, but it is nevertheless your story.
And I invite you to speak to the author! </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - So the
great mirror does exist. It is the great book in which these stories are
written. It is our conscious awareness. Oh, I see what you mean. I am writing
a tale about the observer and his sensitive consciousness. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - At best
the great mirror is beautifully flawed. This part of the story goes back
to Frege. Frege believed that there must be an extension to every concept.
He believed that to every concept there would be the set of all those entities
that satisfy the concept. For example, if I have the concept of honest
men, then there is the set of all honest men. Here is a belief in the perfect
mirroring of concept and realization of concept. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - This
sounds like a good story. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - Bertrand
Russell came along and produced the concept whose extension is R, the set
of all sets that are not members of themselves. For example the set of
all philosophers is not a philosopher, hence is not a member of itself.
The set of all concepts is itself a concept and hence is a member of itself.
Is R a member of itself? If R is a member of itself, then R must not be
a member of itself. If R is not a member of itself then R must be a member
of R. Either choice leads to a contradiction. The great mirror has a beautiful
crack. Attempts to tell a story about an actuality and its perfect description
are doomed to incompleteness. This is just a special case of the more general
result that distinctions are fictions and that it is actually not possible
to make a distinction that does not spring a leak in time or space. In
fact, as you see from Russell, paradox generates time! Each attempt to
construct R is incomplete. We keep including the old R in the new R in
hopes of a completion, and this is time. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - Well
I am a practical mathematical person. I think that my mathematics is made
of solid distinctions that have survived the tests of time and of consistency.
Numbers exist and I can use them the model the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - Yes. And
what are your numbers? They are generalizations of single marks. The mark
in our story, denoted by sharp brackets, could be the number zero, or perhaps
the number one. (It is after all one mark.) And how do you know it? You
know it by your ability to make a distinction. By now you will admit that
ability has its limitations, not just the Russellian ones, but simpler
ones such as the need to be awake in order to perform the duty of discriminating
between the presence and the absence of the brackets. Thus numbers and
all your other mathematical models are based upon your ability to make/imagine
a distinction. You make this up. You play hide and seek with it. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - How
far do you go in this line of thought? </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - I go all
the way. Appearance and reality are identical. You, in so far as you are
distinct to yourself and to others, are a mark (of distinction). The world
as reality and the world as map are identical. The map is the territory.
However, in order for the world to perceive itself it must imagine that
it is divided into a part that sees and a part that is seen. This condition
is the fiction on which we base explanations and science. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - What
do you get from having the calculus of indications? </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - The calculus
of indications is a gem. It is a rigorous mathematical system of extreme
simplicity in which we can see the genesis of form and the dissolution
of form. Furthermore, the calculus of indications lets us reverse the descent
into an ascent and tell many new tales of mathematics, communication and
cybernetics. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Jeremy - When
will you tell those stories? </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><FONT COLOR="#FFF0B7"><FONT SIZE=+0>Lou - I will
begin them in the next column. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
