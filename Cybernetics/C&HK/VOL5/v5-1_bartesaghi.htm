<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">What would it mean for
psychotherapy to be conversation? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The provocative implication
that therapy, as it now stands, is not conversational-though the author
insists it could be-is the focus of Harlene Anderson's most recent book.
Anderson has been a conversational partner of her clients, students and
colleagues at the Galveston Family Therapy Institute (which she co-founded
with the late Harold Goolishian) for twenty-some years, and the critical
significance of this question is revealed in the way she chooses to begin
her own answer to it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The book opens with an
account of failed the-rapy, in the form of a letter written to the author
by a Swedish family prior to their consultation. In the narrative of the
family's painful, lengthy search for a professional who would actually
&quot;listen&quot; to their daughters suffering from anorexia, someone
who would not operate under the a-priori supposition that they knew more
or knew best, Anderson hears a sincere appeal. The rest of the book is
a response to this appeal, and the beauty of Anderson's answer is that
she offers her response as a whole person, primarily as a human being,
and, secondarily as a theoretician and practicing professional in the field
of psychotherapy. Indeed, the author strives to re-articulate the impasse
engendered in the dichotomy between the two halves of this whole as a linguistic
issue, one of &quot;technique taking precedence over person.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Anderson contends that
it is the use of medical, specialized language that leads both therapist
and client to occupy conversational positions which close off, rather than
open the door to a mutual exchange. In contrast, she allows the pages of
her book to become a space for opening up the conversation on therapy,
and adopts conversation as the very metaphor for the endeavor. This accomplishes
three important things. First, she reveals the institution of therapy-and
this includes the brand of family therapy that evolved from systems theory
and (first-order) cybernetics-as a vestige of the modernist tradition.
Second, adopting the questioning, tentative stance offered by postmodernism,
she offers an alternative to modernist tenets of therapy as a medical endeavor,
whereby a professional is called upon to &quot;fix&quot; a problem by imposing
a solution from a third-person perspective of being outside the immediate
conversation. This stance, which Anderson presents in her own collage of
hermeneutics, narrative theory and social constructionism, can best be
described in terms of a drive to open up the certainty of monologic thought
on the matter of &quot;problems&quot; in therapy to the alternative-a space
where problems are not &quot;held&quot; by the client and &quot;solved&quot;
by the therapist but dis-solved in reciprocal and open interaction between
the two. Third, she offers a glimpse of a dialogical construction of human
beings as beings in conversation, where the conversational metaphor entails
reciprocity, accountability and possibility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">What struck this particular
reader is that the author accomplishes all this in a way that speaks not
only of her integrity but as something else she exudes, which I can only
describe as grace: her tone is never polemic, her suggestions never dogmatic,
her first-person narration never affected. She intersperses theory with
bits of session conversations, if not entire sessions, and a significant
portion of the book is dedicated to insights offered by her clients. Unlike
anything I have read before, Anderson's postmodernism is not theory but
lived experience. She includes excerpts from fiction, and tidbits of herself
as a person-how she perceives herself, and how others perceive her (recounting
her exhaustion after a trip, her frankly emotional response to a client's
story, and the experience of being described as a &quot;boredom-making
machine&quot; at a conference). Anderson clearly offers an invitation to
her readers, to read her book as they please, according to what they wish
to get out of it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">For a postmodern thinker
to offer a negative appraisal of modernism is of course nothing new. However,
for a therapist such as the author to do so is a bold move that involves
questioning the very essence of the overarching therapeutic model-be it
that of traditional psychoanalysis, the wide array of behavioral or cognitive
schools of individual therapy, or for that matter family systems therapy,
which grew out of a desire to broaden the focus from the individual to
communication processes between individuals. Anderson's contention is that
what needs to be addressed is the very essence of therapy as a therapist-led
endeavor, yielding therapist-determined possibilities. Hence, she challenges
the mechanistic metaphor that informs the entire enterprise: namely, the
entailments of a therapeutic metaphor that constructs clients as observable/knowable
machines with a deficiency or problem in their mechanism; a specialized
deficiency-based scientific language for the accurate description of a
behavioral and emotional reality, which exists as a tangible referent of
its linguistic construction; and, most importantly as far as the author
is concerned, a privileged knower trained in the process of inquiry-extracting
the right information-into the machine, the end result of which should
optimally bring (read: if the therapist is competent and skillful) localization
of the problem and provision of a solution or fix. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The mechanistic metaphor
described above can only be afforded by a modernist idea of language, which,
in the words of Richard Rorty, serves as a &quot;mirror of nature.&quot;
If language is considered as a mirror, then the essence of such constructs
as &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;self&quot; will be fixed in words of pure
denotation, and given a tangible existence outside of the language itself.
This language, which is the monologic voice of scientific theory, cannot
be meant for conversation-a first on second-person endeavor that requires
participants to be within it-but only for observation and classification,
and closure of conversation by an outside observer/knower. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In the mental health field,
this practice of observation and classification (or, as Anderson proposes
we should conceive of it, the closing off of all possibilities for alternative
interpretations) starts before the session proper with the clinical chart.
The chart immediately enables-or rather, constrains-the therapist entering
the session to be primed for gathering linguistic cues that will provide
explanations, in the forms of symptoms, for the disturbances listed on
the chart. In turn, this narrowing of possibilities will lead to the formulation
of a diagnosis and-in the best of all possible worlds-therapeutic interventions,
which will affect change in the form of a cure that restores optimal operation
by pointing to the source of trouble in the patient-machine. Anderson convincingly
argues that this process is a perfect circular system for the reification
of expert knowledge. In actuality, it produces knowledge that she describes
as &quot;the delusion of understanding or the security of methodology.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Anderson includes the
first-order cybernetic view of Batesonian-inspired therapy in this model,
which-by conceptualizing families as closed systems resisting change-did
no more than move the focus of pathology from the individual to the family.
This places the group of therapists known as &quot;the team&quot; in the
position of hierarchically superior observers, behind the traditional one-way
mirror, seeing but not seen, privileged and unaccountable. The language
of this brand of therapy centers on the therapist-client conflict: clients
are seen as opponents to the therapist who must, in effect, beat them.
Families are said to &quot;resist&quot; change, and display &quot;attrition&quot;
to the therapist's &quot;strategic&quot; &quot;interventions.&quot; Ironically,
if change does not happen, it is the therapist's skill that is at issue,
rather than a breakdown inherent in the therapist-client relationship.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">This is a juncture of
the book where Anderson does not mince her words. In a virtual response
to critics of the postmodern as an apolitical, anything-goes theoretical
attitude she writes that: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">the dominant voice, the
culturally designated political voice, usually speaks and decides for marginal
populations-gender, economic, ethnic, political and racial minorities-whether
therapy is indicated and, if so, which therapy and toward what purpose.
Sometimes unwittingly, sometimes knowingly, therapists subjugate or sacrifice
a client to the influences of this broader context, which is primarily
patriarchal, authoritarian and hierarchical. </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">True to her theoretical
stance, Anderson proposes no &quot;cure&quot; or solution for this, but
an alternative way to do therapy as a &quot;mutual endeavor toward possibility.&quot;
This is presented through a metaphor which resounds as a leitmotif of her
work: space. What she means by space is indeed the crucial feature of the
Anderson and Goolishian therapeutic approach, presented in the many articles
they published as a team prior to this volume. Space entails the withholding
of the therapist's pre-conceived specialized knowledge in order to allow
for a collaborative conversation with clients in which new meanings are
free to emerge. It is therefore the space for a dialogical conversation.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Anderson draws upon the
idea of dialogue first introduced by linguistic philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin
in his analysis of Dostojevsky's fiction, and elaborated by social constructionist
thinking on the potentialities of a conversational construction of human
interaction. While monologue is the master narrative of modernism and the
voice of the therapist's authority to silence client voices, dialogue involves
an idea of reciprocity and equal accountability of participants, and of
the interaction between them as a generative process of self-and-other
enrichment through openness, reflexivity and collaboration. It is at its
core a deeply ethical and moral vision. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">While Anderson embraces
the dialogical vision, she also stops short of its inherent potential for
self-invalidation. That is, if dialogue were to become a normative condition,
its very tenets would be sabotaged. As a dialogic thinker, she intuitively
resists the notions of &quot;problems&quot; or the closed intelligibility
offered by diagnostic descriptions. As a conversational therapist, she
does not veto her clients' choice to adopt the very language of deficiency
she wishes to undo. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In Chapters 6 and 7 Anderson
details her task as a therapist-participant in conversations with her clients
by describing the therapeutic stance of &quot;not knowing.&quot; What the
therapist should not know, and indeed should prevent herself from knowing
is anything that cannot be created by therapist and client from within
the conversation. Because Anderson, as the therapist, is &quot;inside,
and not outside, the process (she) is trying to create&quot; all that she
is required to know is how to keep the conversation going. Conversation
in this sense is an elaboration of Shotter's idea of &quot;joint action&quot;-a
languaging that proceeds moment to moment, of which the ultimate outcome
is unknown and always open to be affected by participants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Anderson describes the
not knowing stance as one of freedom. Once the therapist is liberated from
the constraints of having to control the conversation, the space is opened
for creativity, trust, and problems to be dis-solved by alternative venues
of self-narration. The &quot;self&quot; of the client is a narrative that
emerges in collaborative conversation with the therapist, and with it the
possibility for reconfiguration if so desired. If change should happen,
it will involve a change for both parties as contributors to the dialogical
narrative. What is also advocated here is an abandonment of medical language
in favor of word choices that do not privilege third-person or meta observation.
What replaces it is an I-Thou relationship which is only possible if the
therapist is to be a true conversational partner. In dialogical space there
is no need for agreement, for that too may endanger dialogue, no absolute
claim of understanding the other, but rather humility, ambiguity and what
she aptly refers to as &quot;courage for uncertainty.&quot; As I see it,
it is the courage to reformulate the entire set of expectations of what
therapy is all about. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">On this note, if there
is something that I feel is perhaps lacking in Anderson's account, it is
something that I have encountered almost without fail in my brief forays
as a participant-observer of the therapy process. Clients dislike uncertainty
as much as therapists. They come to the therapeutic encounter wanting answers.
Although they do not wish to be condescended to, they often rate the ability
of their therapist in terms of his or her ability to pinpoint the reason
for the problem that brought them to therapy in the first place. Perhaps
Anderson might have given more space than a brief paragraph to the matter
of the difficulty of embracing uncertainty by those whose life is already
ridden with it. Had she done so, I feel that her attack on traditional
therapy's upholding of social- including economic and educational-inequalities
would have been bolstered by examples of the ability of dialogic therapy
to address them.</FONT></P>
