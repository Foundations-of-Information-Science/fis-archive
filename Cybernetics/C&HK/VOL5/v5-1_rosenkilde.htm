<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Encyclopedia of Systems
and Cybernetics attempts to encompass the whole field of Systems and Cybernetics.
The author, who originally worked in general system theory, demonstrates
how many similar concepts and models have appeared independently in many
different disciplines. He wonders if synthesis and short cuts might be
possible and as well to interconnect various streams in the field. The
author's viewpoint is global, ecological and in opposition to linear and
reductionist models, and he claims: &quot;Systemics is the most important
mental and physical mutation since at least the Renaissance.&quot; (p.
7-8). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The main objective of
the present work is to correlate and unify the language of Systemics and
Cybernetics in order to transform it into an efficient tool for the study
of complexity. To create a conceptual hologram of the whole field of Systems
and Cybernetics as it is now. The encyclopedia offers an attempt to connect
the various terms from many disciplines and thereby create a meaningful
conceptual structure and to raise a kind of systems building out of it.
He wants to provide specialists and non-ditto with a meta-language that
opens the possibility for conversation and transdisciplinary conversation
in order to enable specialists and non-specialists to tackle global and
complex situations together. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">This is a very ambitious
goal and before we make up our mind whether this is achieved, we will look
closer at the encyclopedia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The encyclopedia is built
up alphabetically with about 3000 entries and 1200 references. It has a
remarkably good typographical layout and consists of three parts. The first
is the individual entries, which have marks for what kind of information
can be found in each. Second is an appendix with a list of journals and
proceedings. The last part is a bibliography. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">According to the editor
the encyclopedia can be used from high school level up, even though not
all subjects will be crystal clear for all readers. In our opinion, novice-users
(newcomers) must be on a certain level (university) to fully understand
the contents of the encyclopedia. Novice-users must make persistent efforts
in studying the subjects due to the many concepts that are emphasized in
bold type (which eases cross references across the entire work). In order
to understand the concepts the novice-users must read the encyclopedia
more than once, as each concept refers to at least seven other concepts,
which itself also has several cross references. This is a very fine help
but also a very great burden to contemplate. Perhaps some kind of introductory
text would help. See also the discussion of the historical perspective
below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The editor also uses the
concepts in bold type as a learning process where the user is forced to
stop and reconsider the meaning of the concepts once more. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">We see a danger in these
cross-references, analogous to hyper-links, where the novice-user can get
lost in the system because of uncertainty about the meaning of the concepts
in the encyclopedia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">For the intermediate user
(uses the encyclopedia from time to time) the encyclopedia is a well qualified
work of reference. Such users will not need so much information from cross-references.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">For the expert-user: The
work is very rich, covering well the whole transdisciplinary area, where
there are so many different sub-schools and paradigms. Francois has done
a tremendous job and a great service to systems and cybernetics, and we
would like to underline that writing is difficult and criticizing is easy
- and even more so than usual in this attempt to cover such a huge area
with multitudes of opinions and angles. So the following remarks must be
seen as help in carrying on this great task. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In general this is an
encyclopedia, not a dictionary, and it is much richer in concepts and in
explanations than the dictionary on the Principia Cybernetica homepage.
Now and then one is provided relatively short and precise definitions of
terms, but for the most there is also - or only - a discussion of different
researchers' use of the term or point of view on the subject matter, mostly
backed up by quotes from primarily material. This is very elucidating,
although sometimes it is difficult to see where the editor's opinion starts
and stops, where different viewpoints compete. Sometimes there is so much
and varied material that one ends up confused. This is not necessarily
bad if this is actually the state of understandingin this field. But if
one wants to keep it simple, stay with the shorter definitions in the dictionary
on the Principia Cybernetics homepage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The criteria for concepts
are very broad and many unfamiliar terms are mentioned besides terms used
in the literature. Special concepts are included insofar they have had
any significant relation to systemics or the term introduces some significant
systemic meaning. Although the broad criteria for concepts may possibly
create difficulties in grasping the essence of systems concepts, or one
might end up in accepting every concept as systems (if one does not handle
the encyclopedia with care), the broad criteria for concepts create a picture
of a hypercomplex world where growing complexity makes the holistic view,
which the systems approach attempts to emphasize the importance of, very
apparent, and a new way to look more globally at the world even more necessary.
Furthermore the broad criteria for concepts create a possibility for illuminating
in mature concepts of the field and for mutual enrichment, as well as finding
significant linkages within in the field. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">One can look up various
schools, organizations and journals and there is a very rich and valuable
reference list in the work. But we would benefit from a characterization
of these schools against each other and maybe even an attempt to place
researchers within some of the schools/paradigms such as general systems
theory contra second order cybernetics, so one can see which views compete
when different definitions are presented in a paragraph. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Our special focus on this
work is its usefulness for second order cybernetics and autopoiesis theory:
others must give opinions on its usefulness seen from other positions and
paradigms. Looking through all the articles we found around 60 terms typical
for second order cybernetics, but it is not very clearly marked that they
are terms from a different position than the rest, although one can read
about second order cybernetics and von Foerster and about autopoiesis and
Maturana and Varela. It was interesting to note that such essential terms
for autopoiesis theory as for example: languaging, consensual domain, consensual
distinction, compensatory change, communicative domain, cognitive domain,
behavioral coupling and biological phenomenology were not to be found.
Furthermore, the definition of coupling does not represent the autopoietic
understanding of this concept. The definition of system ( cybernetic) is
in our opinon not specific enough and it is too vague to be really helpful.
The definition of the concept structural coupling goes not deep enough
into the evolutionary and cognitive significance of this concept in autopoiesis
theory to give a profound understanding. Within second order cybernetics
we do not think that there is an optimal number of original quotes from
Maturana, Varela and Luhmann - not to mention Glanville. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">It is a strength that
the encyclopedia also covers some aspects of semiotics, especially Peirce&acute;s
semiotics, which in our opinion is the theory of signification that fits
second order cybernetics and general systems theory best. The covering
of language, pragmatics and semantics is somewhat weak. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Perhaps the encyclopedia
would benefit from a short historical overview over a couple of pages,
with some illustrative maps and definitions of schools and key persons
in the introduction. This would strengthen the historical and dynamic perspective
that is so important in systems and cybernetics, and make the diversity
of schools clear for the reader. This would equip them better to use the
encyclopedia, which cannot of course do anything else than present the
terms in one alphabetical sequence on an equal basis. But one could add
a system of marks signaling which school point of view - often a quote
- is from. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The weakness in the encyclopedia
is partly in the sources and partly in the bibliography. Translation and
retranslation has been noticed, but the author states that the best recent
author used is not always the original. Many of the used sources are second
hand, which means that these are already interpreted (and thereby colored
by the author). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In the bibliography it
would had been an advantage if there had been cross-references to other
authors who are not the first author (for instance like Varela, who worked
with Maturana, cannot be located without knowing that he is placed under
Maturana&acute;s name). It would also have been nice if the form of names
weres the same all through the work (for instance the author Ernst von
Glaserfeld is placed under &quot;von Glaserfeld E.&quot; in the Supplement
and under &quot;Glaserfeld, Ernst von&quot; in the bibliography. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The editor is planning
to prepare future updates of the encyclopedia, which gives an opportunity
to adjust these slight imperfections. For the future updates we see a CD-ROM-edition
as an evident and useful supplement to the work. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">As for the goal of the
encyclopedia to establish a better ground of communication (both transdisciplinary
as well as between specialists and non) within Systems and Cybernetics,
we believe that this work is a useful step in the right direction. Despite
our suggestions, this is a unique work that every major research and educational
library should have. It is a very valuable reference work for researchers,
teachers and students in the field, and therefore for all libraries in
research and educational institutions. A supplement in form of a more dictionary-like
work can, as mentioned, be found on the Principia Cybernetica web site.
