(Cybernetic) Musing: Varieties of Variety?</FONT></FONT></FONT></H3>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times"><FONT SIZE=+1>By
Ranulph Glanville</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In this issue's column,
I wish to explore a question. The question is, how many varieties of variety
are there? Pushed a little, this transforms into what on earth is variety
that we can use it as a measure? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">This is a genuine question,
and I have no ready-made answer, although I have been aware of it for some
time, first attempting to deal with it in a presentation at the EMCSR in
1988 (which I found I could not commit to paper). I find the notion of
variety to be extraordinarily useful in explaining many things about the
world I find myself in, especially in terms of limitations (in particular,
Bremmermann's limit of transcomputability) and of creativity; the loss
of control and the generation of the new, especially in conversations.
I have written about these under the heading &quot;The Value of Unmanageability&quot;
and mean to come back to them in a later column. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">As I see it, Ashby makes
two quite different uses of his term variety (Ashby 1956). The first (which
I shall refer to as e-variety) metaphorically uses a concept from physics-entropy.
The second (s-variety) is simply to do with the number of states in a system.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">So the first of these
uses is heavily influenced by Shannon and Weaver's Information Theory (Shannon
and Weaver 1949) (hardly surprising, considering when Ashby was developing
his concept). The measure of variety is closely analogous to the measure
of information that Shannon and Weaver proposed (as a complement to kinetic
entropy), but whereas the computation of information depends on the basic
informational unit, the bit, variety depends on Ashby's operational and
organisational unit, the state. In this incarnation, variety is a measure
of how many of the possible states a system could (theoretically/logically)
attain which it actually uses. This can be useful in determining &quot;expandability&quot;
in a system, ie how many further states it might attain, although the fact
that a system does not take up all logically possible states may, itself,
be of interest and tell us much, just as this does in information theory-where
it can be used, for instance, to help code-breaking. This value of absence
seems to be at the very heart of computing: for in (digital) computing
the 0's are every bit (!) as important as the 1's: what matters is that
every address is fillable, and only then whether it is filled and how full
it is. An empty address is as significant as a filled one. Of course, musicians
have known this for a long time, filling their pieces with what we sometimes
call &quot;telling&quot; silences. John Cage took to a final extreme in
his piece 4'32&quot;, a totally silent piano piece. Architects, too, would
claim that the material they manipulate (space) is essentially the lack
of material: massive silences between the stones. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Returning to variety,
it is the second use that seems to me potentially the richer. Here, Ashby
just counts and enumerates the states the system can take. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In this case, Ashby is
only dealing with one aspect of the equation which constructs his e-variety.
He is simply looking at the (number of) actual states that may be attained.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Perhaps I should rehearse
the difference, hoping to make clear my understanding. Consider a set of
traffic lights. Since these differ in how they work according to the country
they are in, I will use the British system for convenience. There the lights
follow the following sequence: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">red (code for stop) <BR>
red and amber (code for prepare to go) <BR>
green (code for go) <BR>
amber (code for stop, unless to do so would be dangerous) <BR>
red (code for stop) </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">There are just 4 states
in this sequence. However, the possible combinations of 3 light colours
is 2<SUP>3</SUP>, or 8 states (omitted in the British system are green
and amber; red and green; red, green and amber all together; and no lights
at all-although this last logical possibility is often taken to be code
for watch out, there's a problem here-the lights must have broken down!).
In the second interpretation Ashby gives to his term variety, it is the
number of states actually possible in the system as it operates (ie, in
this case 4), rather than the relationship between the actual and the logical
(ie 8) number of states possible that is of concern. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">What interests me is what
Ashby uses this (state) measure of s-variety for. In particular, I have
a great respect and affection for his &quot;Law of Requisite Variety&quot;.
There are a number of ways of expressing this Law-for instance, that only
Variety can destroy Variety-but I like a simple and direct version: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Any controlling system
must have at least as much variety as the (controlled) system it is to
control. </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Like many a profound truth,
this is, I believe, obvious-now that Ashby has said it. If the controlling
system cannot &quot;map&quot; all the states the controlled system may
attain, it cannot control its behaviour because some of the behaviours
of the controlled system are outside the range of the controlling system.
All the controlling system can do, in the case that some behaviour is presented
by the controlled system which it cannot map, is to ignore this behaviour:
and that is not controlling. (In the case of that wonderful control device,
the digital computer, the computer will just crash.) Conversely, when the
controlling system has greater variety than the system it controls, there
is room for the controlled system to change (expand, develop). This is
a point I do not recollect Ashby making, although it is central to any
discussion, in terms of variety, of increases in options. Ashby uses this
Law to determine both whether any proposed control system has a chance
of controlling some system-to-be-controlled, and whether systems are actually
in principle controllable. This latter he does with reference to Bremmermann's
Constant: a numerical limit invented by the physicist Hans J Bremmermann
which, originally, shows what the earth could have computed were it a solid
computer operating over its known life (Bremmermann 1962). Of course, such
a figure is arbitrary and depends on the actual numbers originally chosen
from which to make the calculation. But, this is beside the point: what
is important is not the absolute size of the limit, but the fact that there
is one. As long as it is enumerable, it does not matter so (as Ashby shows)
if the figure is out by millions of times, this is only a tiny error when
compared to the actual number Bremmermann gives as the theoretical limit:
1047 bits computed by the earth during its entire existence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Ashby (1964) extends this
figure to base it around the known universe and ends up with the assertion
that numbers beyond 10<SUP>100 </SUP>are beyond the computable. Bremmermann
had referred to systems that generate these vast numbers of possible states
as transcomputable, since there is no realistic way they can be computed
by completely secure means. Ashby shows that even very small systems (such
as an array of 20 by 20 lights) are essentially transcomputable (such a
board generates 2<SUP>20^20</SUP> possible states, ie 2<SUP>400</SUP>,
which is about 10<SUP>120</SUP>, a number vastly bigger, as mathematicians
remind us, than 10<SUP>100</SUP>). I intend to delve further into the magic
of Bremmermann's Constant at a later date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Thus, while the Law of
Requisite Variety tells us how much variety is required of one system that
is to control another, Bremmermann's Constant, as applied by Ashby (and
later, with great enthusiasm, by Stafford Beer) tells us of the limits
to what is conceivable within the understandings we currently hold about
the universe we inhabit. It turns out that it is very easy to attain variety
that vastly exceeds the capacity of the physical universe to compute it.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Yet we still try to, and
often believe we do, control systems that either are, or are close to,
being uncontrollable because they are transcomputable. (That there are
many other difficulties in making systems controllable pales into insignificance
when compared to this in principle limitation.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Of course, we do have
ways of &quot;reducing&quot; the variety of very complex systems, thus
making them controllable. These usually involve some form of simplification
and approximation: we are willing to trade off the discrete distinction
of each observation for the rough approximations that allow us to control.
Techniques include those of statistics, probability and fuzzification.
In fact, I would postulate that we tend to balance variety against controllability:
this can be seen clearly when we consider ways of representing (or perhaps
embodying) signals. In the case of audio signals, we have long since traded
the infinite variety of the analogue, renowned for terrible problems of
control, for the standardised control of the digital, with its increasing
but never infinite variety. Generally, our ears tell most of us we have
made a good trade-off, albeit that we are strongly influenced by techno-hype.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">But let us return to the
(British) traffic lights. What happens to those who are red-green colour
blind? According to the account given above, since red = green (which I
write as red-green) they will only distinguish 3 states in the sequence,
as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">red-green <BR>
red and amber <BR>
red-green <BR>
amber <BR>
red-green </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">I have not indicated the
code for each, since it is clear that both stop and go may be simultaneously
indicated by the red-green colour even where meaning is communicated by
a code. If it were only colour that distinguished the coded commands, it
would follow that one of the first tests for a potential driver would be
a colour blindness test, but I know of nowhere where this is so. Drivers
can and do distinguish between red and green lights by means other than
colour. Those I have asked who are colour blind tell me they also use position.
That is, there are more states than simply those involved in colour: there
is position as well (ie, red is on top, green at the bottom and amber-when
present-is in the middle). It happens that there is in this case a mapping
between position and colour leading to redundancy and hence to the description
of the states of the traffic light system by means of the states associated
with only one of the variables-colour. But this co-incidence is serendipitous
and certainly not at all logically necessary. And sometimes it is in appropriate.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Thus, I hope it is clear
that variety depends on how the states are defined. What I suspect looked
to Ashby like an absolute measure turns out to depend on our interpretations
and ways of setting up what we're looking for! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">In fact, since it depends
on how we define the states the system takes, in a world in which the observer
is included such as second-order cybernetics, this means that the variety
of a system is open, to some extent at least, to our individual determinations.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">However, under these circumstances
we find we must modify the Law of Requisite Variety. In a second order
(control) system, each component is both controlling and controlled. That
is, each controls the other. Control does not exist in one or the other,
but between them in a circular process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">If, as is demanded by
the Law of Requisite Variety, the variety of the controlling system must
equal or exceed that of the controlled system, it is clear that in a second
order system, where each controls the other, the variety of each system
must exactly match (eg Glanville 1987, 1994). The variety of the one system
must exactly equal that of the other, since each is controlled by that
other (ie, each is the other's controlling system). For second order systems,
the Law of Requisite Variety must be rewritten accordingly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Thus, in second order
systems, it is not possible to leave room for an increase in the controlled
system's variety (by having a controlling system with greater variety)
while maintaining controllability, because the controlling system cannot
have more variety than the controlled since there is ultimately no controlling
and no controlled system (in the classical sense). And yet… </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Systems do increase in
variety, they do grow and change. And, if second order cybernetics is to
reflect this and to benefit from the notion of variety, it is clear that
how we consider variety must, also, change. We can no longer leave room
for change (increase) by creating a controlling system that has more variety
than the controlled system. It is, however, possible that we can design
systems in which variety increases on both sides: either by adding states
or through redefinition, that is through defining the states that pertain
in a different way. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">As I said, I suspect that
Ashby saw variety as being a constant and, indeed, a quality measured in
terms of an absolute quantity, for any system. However, since in second
order cybernetics we demand the active presence of the observer and accept
his/her involvement in determining the qualities of the system, in second
order cybernetics we can expect to be, and anticipate being involved in
the process of definition. And since we can look in more than one way,
use more than one perspective, we can redefine the system so that we can
accommodate change through the way we consider the states attainable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Let me give three examples.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">he first (mine) is perhaps
rather picturesque: it was the first notion I developed when I started
studying with Gordon Pask, and I have not presented it before publicly.
It is a response to the familiar difficulty (Goedellian in nature) that
any universe should contain everything that it needs to contain, yet must
be seen from outside if this is to be appreciated. Then the view from outside,
that the universe does indeed contain everything it should, should be within
the universe, for &quot;contains everything it should&quot; is a property
of that universe! I proposed that the boundaries of universes should be
seen as having metaphorical hands on them, constantly grabbing that which
was outside but should be inside and placing it within the confines of
the universe. Thus, the universe is in a state of constant expansion: that
which had been outside being absorbed-leaving the outside bare, awaiting
another external view (then to be absorbed in turn): variety constantly
increasing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The second concerns the
notion diversity that Heinz von Foerster developed. Von Foerster suggested
that, in a probabilistic system (e-variety is measured, as is entropy,
as a function of probabilities between 0 and 1) the range might exceed
the value 1. As I remember it, the system would then rescale itself to
fit the range 0 to 1. This allowed the system to behave in a manner outside
the range of predictions: ie, to take states that were never considered
when the system was defined. Variety (in the form of s-variety) could be
increased (although the logical total for the system then &quot;rescaled&quot;
after accommodating the new). For some reason, this notion was, as far
as I know, only reported in an internal BCL memo. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">The third comes from discussions
between Mike Robinson (whose outstanding paper on variety I will introduce
when I return to creativity and unmanageability) and myself, in which we
proposed two types of complexity. To paraphrase rather inaccurately, the
first was bottom up, supporting the belief that there was a determinate
variety which leads very quickly to transcomputability (as Ashby showed);
the second top down, allowing that complexity is something that can be
handled by grouping, that is, we see the system and then decide its variety.
This means that variety is determined by the observer. In turn, this alleviates
the problem of increases in variety, for the variety that is seen within
the system can be redefined and, therefore, accommodated. This, however,
means that variety is absolutely not absolute. I did some experimental
work based on this notion, reported in Glanville 1984. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Why does any of this matter?
It matters because of what it suggests for variety. To me it suggests that
there are several kinds of variety, or ways of considering variety (in
a second order world, these are equivalents). There is the difference that
Ashby created in his two uses: variety as the number of states a system
can attain (s-variety); and the &quot;entropically inspired&quot; variety
as the relationship between the logically possible and the actual number
of states a system could achieve (e-variety). Although I now see a connection
between these, I remain confused as to why he used the same term to communicate
these two different measures. To this confusion I have to add the confusion
I find resulting from the need to modify the Law of Requisite Variety that
second-order understanding requires and the experience that not only does
the variety in a system often increase, but it can (and must) be (re-)defined
according to how the included observer chooses to see it. Thus (as the
examples show), variety can be seen as needing to be both static and dynamic,
both defined by the system and observer determined. Are there other qualities
that I have not considered here? I suspect so. Then what are they? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">How many varieties of
variety are there? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="garamond, times new roman, times">Has anyone an answer?</FONT></P>
