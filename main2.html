<u><h3><a href="main.html"><font color="black">... so what is information?</font></a></h3></u>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At least from the scientific point of view, information appears as a vague and incoherent item.
Information belongs to that (not so rare) category of scientific terms which, after their successful
coinage, suffer so much abuse and overextension that a factual abandonment of research ensues, no
matter the apparent brilliancy or social acceptance.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the case of information, the scientific excitement generated during the 40's and 50's -- the
formative years of information theory, cybernetics,  systems theory, etc. -- has steadfastly receded
with every passing decade and presently has almost disappeared, except for some very particular applications.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The FIS-Organisation attempts to rescue information as a central scientific tool and to put it into
a new context so as to serve as a basis for a fundamental disciplinary development. The novelty of our
approach is that, instead of trying a precise 'atomic' definition of information, and actually getting
quagmired in it, information is understood as related to a widespread network of processes potentially 
involving the integration of cosmic (subatomic), molecular, cellular (neuronal), computational, human 
and social occurrences, demanding both a unifying and a multiperspectivistic approach.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So to speak, instead of the discussion of a single particularized concept, information becomes the 
intellectual adventure of developing a 'vertical' science connecting the different scales of 'informational 
processes' -- reminding physics itself, which from a pre-Galilean particularized term evolved towards a 
vertical science connecting the previously separated "celestial", "sublunar", and "terrestrial" occurrences.<p>
