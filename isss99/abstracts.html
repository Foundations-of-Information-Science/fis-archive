<p>Since the Second World War a universal informational
paradigm has been developing as a supplement to the material-atomistic-mechanical and the
energetic-thermodynamical paradigms. There is a growing plea for a universal information
theory, lately supported by Tom Stonier's trilogy. The paradigm is either based on new
concepts - like logical depth of information - built on a development of Shannon's
entropic information concept. On Wiener's (and Schrödinger's) neg-entropic information
concept uniting the entropy concept of thermodynamics with the informational entropy
concept seeing objective information in nature - in a general evolutionary systems'
ontology - as organizing &quot;power&quot;. Ontologically, you can see rather
mechanistically looking concepts as Stonier's or rather organismic views as Goerner's, but
none of them having an explicit reflected ontology. Many researchers today use
Bertalanfy's general systems theory without reflecting on its origin in organismic
ontology. But one may loosely say, that the modern systems vision seems to be based on an
evolutionary systems' view that combines matter, energy, and information as objective
ontological components in an emergent dynamics. The hope is to explain qualia, life, and
consciousness as emergent phenomenon as results of the evolution of material, energetic
and informational systems. The modern versions often use non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
non-linear systems dynamics, deterministic chaos theory and fractal mathematics as
descriptional tools. But again there is seldom reflections on how they differ from a
mechanistic view. The problem is whether this paradigm will ever get a reasonable and
consistent description of the nature of meaning, signification and communication in living
and social systems. </p>

<p>From this end a communicational paradigm mainly based on
Peirce's evolutionary, pragmatic and phenomenological semiotics, the cognition of living
systems (ethology and biosemiotics), and pragmatic linguistics such as Wittgenstein's
language game theory, and Lakoff's cognitive semantics has been developed within the last
twenty years. It is mainly based on the study of the existence of meaningful communication
in living and social systems. It looks into cultural historical dynamics and evolutionary
ecology for explanations of the dynamics of signification and communication. In the form
of biosemiotics its view is now penetrating biology as an alternative to both mechanistic
and purely systems' dynamical explanations. Work has been made in biochemistry and organic
chemistry, but so far not in inorganic chemistry and pure physics. But in Peirce's triadic
objective idealistic philosophy feelings, qualia, habit formation, and signification are
basic ontological constituents of ontology. This means that the communicational paradigm
should be able to penetrate all the way through chemistry and physics. </p>

<p>In my own Cybersemiotic paradigm I have attempted to
unite the two paradigms by using the information concepts denying its objective character,
but without going into a radical constructivism. With second order cybernetics I claim
that reality is full of innumerable differences, but information is something created
inside autopoietic systems in the moment that a biologically or culturally meaningful
interpretant is established. Based on Peircian semiotics information is not seen as
transferred through communication, only representamens are transferred. Information is
partly recreated in the reinterpretation of signs by the receiver of intentional
communication. Consequently, meaning and information are connected, but still seen as
different items as pointed out by Luhmann. Items and actions can only become informative
on the background of a field of meaning. </p>

<p>But in the informational paradigm meaning and information
are not connected and information is an independent objective entity. So another way of
viewing the problem is to see the informational paradigm as 'bottom up explanation' and
the communicational paradigm as a 'top-down explanation'. Further you could combine this
with the epistemological stand that no final scientific explanations can be given on
anything in this world. All we have - according to Niels Bohr and Thomas Kuhn - are
complementary explanations working well in different situations. We will never get a full
view. According to this we should not try to unite by manipulating basic definitions into
unifying compromises, but instead continue to develop each paradigm to its fullest. </p>

<p>But one of the consequences of this is that the concepts
of meaning and information are defined in two completely different paradigms making the
informational aspect of communication an objective and quantifiable entity completely
independent of any meaningful interpretation from the recipient and any intent from the
sender. In linguistics this opposition is seen in the view of analytical philosophy that
semantics is a question of the represental truth function of a token where pragmatic
linguistics sees meaning as coming from the use of signs and words in real life
situations. </p>

<p>The Cybersemiotic paradigm avoids this difficulty through
a non-mechanistic universal evolutionary semiotic approach to epistemology, ontology and
signification combined with a systemic and cybernetic approach to self-organization,
drawing among other things on Luhmann's theories of social communication. Thereby, in the
theory a semiotics of nature can be combined with pragmatic linguistics in a second order
approach that always reflects the role of the observer as the producer of meaningful
contexts that makes processes and differences informational. As Bateson stated:
Information is a difference that makes a difference and with Peirce we will say: by
creating an interpretant. <br>

<p>It is unlikely, at least in the near future, that a
unified information paradigm will emerge that incorporates both the objective sciences of
information and the human sciences of experience. The reason is that the former deals in
objective facts while the latter concerns subjective meanings, and neither can contain the
other. What separates them is the old chasm that divides mind and body, recently rephrased
as the <i>hard problem</i> of how subjective experience, termed <i>consciousness</i>, is
so enigmatically and intimately tied to the objective world of extended reality and to the
brain in particular. It would seem, however, that a truce, or even simpatico, might be
achieved between the objective and human sciences if a common topology can be found which
maps the attributes of both in a way that does not violate the properties of either. Since
objective information is always conveyed by some physical <i>carrier</i>, it follows that
the carrier, in this case some aspect of the brain and its processes, must allow a
sensible resemblance (or mapping) to attributes of experience itself (though not
necessarily in an obvious way). This in mind, it is reasonable to examine theories of
brain function in hopes of finding one or more that hold the requisite potential. What
would seem to be needed is a way for the brain to encode analogue aspects of experience,
such as sensations and emotions, as well as performing logical operations involving
categories, as exhibited in language. Computational models are weak in the former, though
strong in the latter. Neural network models are the opposite, though offer hope for
explaining categorical operations as well. At the same time they hold forth the
possibility of a more veridical representation of the brain itself. Considered
dynamically, neural network operations can encode analogue processes and also represent
logical ones, though with some difficulty--a situation that seems quite human. Karl
Pribram's holonomic approach deserves special note as a brain model that takes advantage
of the neural network approach in a unique paradigm designed to represent the actual
dimensions of subjective experience. Other more speculative approaches include recent
models that draw on quantum physics either for their overall logic (Henry Stapp), or for
working details of how the brain encodes experiential events (e.g., Stuart Hameroff and
Roger Penrose). Fortunately, these latter approaches are not developing in isolation, but
despite controversies within the neuroscience community are enriching each other in the
laboratory and on the theoretical drawing board.</p>

<p>Virtual logic stands outside the logic of true and false
and points to that domain from which Reason springs forth. This talk will discuss the
theme of virtual logic in relation to second order cybernetics, process theory and the
methods of paradox resolution (the Flagg Resolution) pioneered by James Flagg and the
speaker.</p>

<p>Our method of paradox resolution is a direct descendant
of Ludwig Wittgenstein's injunction to solve problems as they arise. &quot;...it is
vitally important to see that a contradiction is not a germ which shows general
illness.&quot; [L. Wittgenstein. Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics. edited by
Cora Diamond, Cornell Univ. Press (1976). Lecture XXI, p. 211]. In the Flagg resolution we
give a method whereby one can take a seemingly contradictory entity at face value, modify
the mode by which we indicate that entity (the way we engage in substitution and reference
to the entity), and retain standard logical discourse.</p>

<p>The practical consequence of this move is of great
importance for the foundations of information science. On the one hand the Resolution is a
formal move that allows the discourse to continue to flow forward. On the other hand the
issue of deeper understanding is placed squarely in the hands of the person or observer in
the system. The responsibility is in the hands of the observer. The mathematics is in the
hands of the mathematician. Formal systems and computer systems are aids in the flow of
communication, but the responsibility goes to the observer. It is the observer who
initiates the creative process by distinguishing the space and indicating its contents. It
is the observer who stands to gain or lose in the dialogue about consistency and
continuation of the conversation.</p>

<p>In Mathematics a theorem is proved when it becomes
evident. The proof is not a matter of true and false; it is a matter of coherent
indication. What is indicated is a collection of (from the stance of the mathematician)
indisputable distinctions that cohere into the conclusion that is the theorem. Reason and
logic are seen within this coherence. The theorem is not proved by logic or reason. The
distinctions that constitute the proof are not a matter of dispute. They are agreed upon
by the community of mathematicians, and are each reproducible by every individual in that
group. It is exactly because proof goes beyond true and false that the gambit of proof by
contradiction can be taken. The mathematical universe is not fragile. It will not collapse
in the face of an apparent contradiction any more than the discovery of Russell's paradox
caused bridges to fall.</p>

<p>We stand on the other side of the watershed of Godel's
Theorem. No single machine, nosingle formal system can encompass the acts of Reason. We
must act responsibly in an endless creation of such systems and the patterns that can be
generated with them. Any attempt at founding a general theory of information science --
especially those building on &quot;objective&quot; concepts of information -- must take
these facts into consideration.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In cognitive sciences, there is a divide
between a naturalistic main stream and a culturalistic thread. The first one, known as
cognitivism, comprises the symbolism and the connectionism which are based upon the
assumption of the computability of cognitive processes, while the second one, the
phenomenological-hermeneutic thinking, defies this very assumption and postulates,
instead, features of cognition in their own right. Put together, both approaches are not
supplementary in providing an appropriate picture of the phenomenon of cognition: With
regard to the role experience is thought to play in cognition, either the tradition of
sensualistic and empiristic aposteriorism is continued or, in a rationalist&#146;s or in
an &quot;autist&#146;s&quot; manner, the existence of aprioris is suggested. Concerning
the relation between cognitions and the objects they refer to, you either have to choose
the representational stance of objectivism or the constructivistic, solipsistic,
spiritualistic or platonistic view of subjectivism. And as to the intentionality of
cognitons, causal relationships between cognitions are considered sufficient (causalism)
or explanations which resort to attitudes of persons towards situations are deemed
essential (intentionalism, &quot;voluntarism&quot;). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is, computationalism, on the one
hand, and phenomenology and hermeneutics, on the other, are extreme positions which are
one-sided and cannot be mediated as such. However, it is favorable to adopt another point
of view that tries to take up those aspects which are reflected in a right way. This seems
possible by applying the emergentist methodology of evolutionary systems. Thus, in human
information generating systems, perception may be looked upon as a concurrence of
reception and conception resulting in data, interpretation may be conceived as as an
interplay of &quot;projection&quot; (construction) and &quot;introjection&quot;
(adaptation) producing knowledge with meaning, and evaluation/decision may be the
collaboration of descriptive and prescriptive processes leading to what, eventually, can
be labelled as &quot;wisdom&quot; containing values, ethics, morals, as is shown in the
figure. <br>

  <li><strong>Information Processing as an Aspect of the
    Dynamics of the Processes Underlying Function </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Computer and Information Science Department College of
Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Michigan-Dearborn Dearborn, Michigan
48128 </p>

<p>The view of information processing as an aspect of the
dynamics of the processes underlying function provides a uniform framework for the study
of information and information processing at various levels of biological and human
organization. This view is consistent with a broad notion of information and information
processing that allows for the study of natural and artificial information processing
within a uniform framework. In this paper we propose the use this view as a framework to
analyze the role of information in practically any context. This framework is consistent
with a broad notion of computation, one that ascribes some kind of computational power to
any particular dynamic process. It can be used to analyze information-processing related
issues at various scales of information processing in biological systems, and at various
levels of biological organization [Kampfner, 1998]. At the biological level of human
populations, for example, issues arising in connection with information-processing issues
of social systems and, in particular, human organizations, can be studied with the help of
this framework. </p>

<p>Using a broad notion of computation that encompasses both
natural and artificial computing we focus on a trait common to all purposeful dynamic
processes: they use information to guide their behavior. The notion of computation used
here ascribes computational power to any dynamic process in the sense that any such
process computes at least its own dynamics. M. Conrad [1985] explained this idea in
relation to a strong form of the Turing-Church thesis that asserts that any physical
process can be simulated by a Turing Machine [Hofstadter, 1979]. The equivalence between
dynamics and computation that the strong form of the Turing-Church thesis suggests can
also be interpreted as conferring some kind of computational power to all physical
processes. </p>

<p>There are essential differences between algorithmic
computation, and that performed by the physical processes. Most notably, while algorithmic
computation is performed with a general-purpose computing device, a particular physical
process performs a very specific kind of computation. A consequence of this is that the
algorithms used for the simulation of physical processes are, in most cases, of a great
computational complexity. In contrast with this, the computations performed by the
physical processes themselves, since they result from the dynamics of such processes in a
natural way, can be considered less computationally complex than their algorithmic
counterparts. Another difference relates to the adaptability of information processing.
According to M. Conrad's tradeoff principle [Conrad, 1985], in any information-processing
system there is always a tradeoff between adaptability and programmability. The tradeoff
principle places natural computing processes, such as molecular computing, which are
inherently adaptable, and algorithmic computation, which is programmable, at the two ends
of an adaptability-programmability continuum. </p>

<p>Despite the specificity that in general characterizes the
computational capabilities of physical processes, there is a trait common to all of them;
namely, that all of them use information to guide their behavior in order to achieve their
specific purpose. This common purpose and the notion of computation as an aspect of the
dynamics of physical processes are what give uniformity to our framework. Of the many
issues that viewing information processing as an aspect of the dynamics of natural and
artificial systems helps us to analyze, this paper focuses on the study of the
compatibility between artificial and natural computing in adaptive systems, such as
organizations. Especially important, in this respect, is that the computations performed
by physical processes are not only specific in purpose, but that the fact that they are
part of the dynamics of these processes makes these computations highly compatible with
them. Clearly, these computations can be said to support these processes in an effective
manner. The paper will discuss issues related to this compatibility in some detail. </p>

<p>This paper is focused around three questions. The first
question - what is information? It is energy that is 'in relation with' other forms or
processes of energy. The establishment of these relations means that energy is capable of
'informing', which is to say, interacting with other forms/processes of energy. All
forms/processes of energy, whether within the physico-chemical, biological and conceptual
worlds, are filiated within a semiotic process that catalyzes changes in energy states to
establish relationships between these states and thereby transform energy into
information. </p>

<p>The second question - how is energy transformed into
information? The basic postulate is that the universe consists entirely of codification
processes that transform free or 'uninformed' energy into 'informational relationships'
operating within hierarchically ordered, multiresolutional and interfiliated modules or
aggregates of codal orders. Information is understood to operate as codified microstates
of energy/matter and therefore, semiosics considers that all energy processes, independent
of any consciousness or secondary articulation of their interaction, are, in and of
themselves, of whatever scale and complexity -- informational processes. The semiotic
transformation of energy to information is both a logical and a phenomenological process,
and operates within both universal laws and local contexts. </p>

<p>Does information, to be information, require an
anthropomorphic or ontogenetic consciousness of that energy as information? There is a
difference between referentiality (which supplies the measures of codification processes)
and metareferentiality (which supplies an objective measurement or means of referring to
that referential codification). Is metareferentiality necessary for the transformation of
energy to information? My answer is that it is - but, is it a factor of ontogenetic
processes, ie, operative within the phenomenology of the individual, or can it be
subsumed, and operative only within the phylogeny, within the logical habitus of the
species? Can metareferentiality operate as a factor of pragmatics, of the Aristotelian
final cause and therefore, are there different types of consciousness - a local and a
universal, a current and a future-oriented, a psychological and a logical? </p>

<p>The hypothesis of this paper is that the transformation
of energy to information is an active process that catalyzes changes in energy state at
every level of organization, irregardless of symbolic consciousness, and that it
necessarily operates within an infinite, non-teleological, future-oriented or pragmatic
evolutionary process.<br>

<p>This paper discusses an internalist approach to the
problem of simulating complex economic systems. The focus of the paper is to provide a
view of an empirical system interpreted in the past</p>

<p>progressive tense instead of the present tense. The
linguistic progressive mode instead of the present mode can represent dynamic behaviours
between agents inside a concerned system. Within this context, we argue that information
production is about something being generated by agents of a system but not by outside
observers, the interpretation in the past progressive tense could be good basis which
cannot be ignored when one considers about information.</p>

<p>The context of this study is as follows. When one
describes an empirical system, whatever it may be, there are at least three linguistic
modes available: the present tense mode, the present perfect</p>

<p>and the present progressive. Any dynamic behaviour of
subjects that is in progress could be in the mode of the present progressive tense instead
of the (more commonly occurring) present tense. Let us quote an example by Matsuno (1997),
&quot;I am walking through a crowd and avoiding collisions with other people. Then, I can
see that other people are doing the same. That is, I am walking through the crowd as
collisions with other people being avoided. The statement of my walking in the present
progressive tense makes others beside myself active agents, also. Of course, they are
active observers.&quot; A significance of the present progressive mode is its
multi-agentiality as any empirical systems are so.</p>

<p>There is only one agent which can monopolistically
describe the rest of observers as being frozen both in time and in space, both in the mode
of the present tense and the present perfect tense. As a consequence, the aspect of any
dynamical process between observers could be eliminated in these two modes. Therefore, to
describe an empirical system in the present progressive mode is an important issue when
one seriously attempts to see empirical significance.</p>

<p>One point which does not convince us to employ the
present progressive mode is that the principle of the excluded middle cannot be guaranteed
in the present progressive mode a priori. Any process</p>

<p>described in the present progressive mode is ongoing, but
not yet finished. We, as those describing a concerned system, forcibly face this
difficulty if we seriously consider the use of the present progressive mode. A possible
way to overcome the difficulty could be to rely on an invariant property of a concerned
system. The conservation law of energy or energy flow continuity would be a good example
of such invariance. Observers inside the system can be taken to act so as to fulfil the
conservation law a posteriori, which can be expressed in the present progressive mode.</p>

<p>Apart from physical systems, economies also have such an
invariant property. The maintenance of the monetary flow continuity of each observer or
economic subject is a case in point. Apart from monetary authorities such as central
banks, any economic subject is not allowed to issue bank notes, thus every economic
subject except bank note issuers should maintain their monetary flow equilibrium through
manipulating the intensity of outgoing flow and inflow. If one continuously failed, one
would face bankruptcy, and would no more be an independent economic subject in the
economy. The maintenance of the monetary flow continuity is the most principal process in
the present progressive mode of our modern economies. This dynamics is, however,
necessarily under-complete simply because there is no global co-ordination, in other
words, each economic subject faces its flow disequilibrium indefinitely. Through this
process, something can be fixed in the form of an irrevocable record. Several monetary
records including the currency circulating in the market are available thanks to monetary
authorities.</p>

<p>Based on a non-disequilibrium macroeconomic model
proposed by Matsuno (1978), the authors developed a network-flow model of macroeconomic
systems. The model can reproduce action and reaction by macroeconomic subjects in the form
of their decisions and their monetary flow</p>

<p>disequilibrium as in the past progressive mode and by
referring to several monetary records as a posteriori constraints. So far, about 50 years
of records of the Japanese economy are simulated. Multi-agential systems are found to be
highly fragile because the spatio-temporal horizon of the agents is finite (Matsuno,
1978). In this sense, it might be almost a miracle, take, for example, Japanese economy
has survived so far. This paper addresses aspects of empirical significance how</p>

<p>macroeconomic subject has been struggling for their
survival, in order to provide empirical basis with the issue of information.</p>

<p>The epistemologies, theories and applications of
contemporary science and technology can be collectively and succinctly described as
prototypes emerging from a multidisciplinary network. In the new climate, hierarchies
either become ephemeral or disappear altogether. Mutual causality becomes the rule rather
than the exception. Multidisciplinary and cross cultural cooperation are combining to
rapidly replace relatively strict territorial boundaries of the past. Taken in concert,
the consequences of these transformations on how information is defined and exchanged are
profound. </p>

<p>A primary difficulty is to formulate an approach that is
both free of paradigm territoriality and as independent of arbitrary consensus as
possible. One solution, a spectrum from common sense through biological and natural
sciences, to business, political and military strategy is subjected to a general systems
approach that includes problems of conflict, territoriality and compatibility. To minimize
arbitrariness, information's problems, their consequences and their solutions are
formulated within T. Givón's (1984) approach to syntax provides an optimal division of
labor for the search for a generally accepted definition of &quot;information&quot;. In
addition to presenting a comprehensive picture of syntax, semantics and pragmatics as a
unified whole, Givón's formulation of &quot;the time-stability scale of lexical
classes&quot; facilitates a non-hierarchical approach essential to applications in both
networks and natural environments. </p>

<p>Three major conclusions, first social and cultural
factors can nullify clearly demonstrable empirical facts. Second, the &quot;Prisoner's
Dilemma&quot; is an artifact of specialization. Finally, a neuro mind pattern has emerged
that might serve as a more organic, less mechanical basis for a photo computer system's
reasoning.</p>

<p>The Mindscape concept emerges as our link between the
objective reality of mathematical biology and the personalities of individuals. Originally
formulated by anthropologists to explain irreconcilable differences across cultural and
epistemological barriers, this approach takes advantage of game theory connections to
integrate the mindscape concept into general systems. The result is a biobehavioral
equivalent to &quot;personality theory&quot;, an equivalent that may well permit general
systems to deliver things only promised by humanist philosophers and psychologists.
Mindscape's greatest promise is its contribution to the resolution of conflicts between
groups and personalities.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrating a convincing ontological
vision with a pluralistic epistemology into methodological guidelines for disciplinary and
creative information systems design (ISD) has proved not easy. In the eastern context, the
issue manifests itself especially problematic. Given the primitive, pre-scientific
(mysterious?) outlook of eastern systems thinking on the one hand, and rigor empirical
information science and information technology on the other, the intended integration
appears immediately and profoundly challenging.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper presents an attempt, the WSR
approach, to address and tackle such a challenge. Drawing upon Confucianism, Taoism and
contemporary OR/MS experience in the Chinese context, WSR has tried to enhance the ISD
process by incorporating a few facilitating insights, which are purposively reconstructed
from ancient Chinese thought, e.g., the differentiating-integrating <i>Tao </i>(Way), the
complementary <i>yin-yang </i>(opposites), the bubbling <i>li</i>s (patterns), the cyclic <i>I
</i>(transformation), the spontaneous <i>wu-wei</i> (non-forced action) and the golden <i>chong</i>
(timely-mean).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These insights have been intentionally
deployed by ISD researchers and professionals to <u><b>view</b></u> ISD as an integrated
socio-technological whole, to <u><b>shape</b></u> an ISD issue-task matrix, to <u><b>guide</b></u>
spiral learning activity, to <u><b>facilitate</b></u> user-participation, and to <u><b>indentify</b></u>
further research topics.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach has proved useful in some
ISD projects in China. It is presented here to the FIS group and hence the wider IS
research community for the purpose of mutual informing, stimulating and learning.<br>
